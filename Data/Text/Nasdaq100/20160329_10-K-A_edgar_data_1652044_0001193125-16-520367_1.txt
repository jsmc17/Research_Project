Late Form 4 reports were filed for each of L. John Doerr, Diane B. Greene, John Hennessy, Ann Mather, Alan R. Mulally, K. Ram Shriram, and Shirley Tilghman on July 23, 2015 to report their respective non-employee
director annual refresh grants (673 shares of Class C GSUs, except for Alan R. Mulally who received a prorated grant of 580 shares of Class C GSUs) awarded on July 1, 2015.

 We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and
principal accounting officer), and employees, known as the Alphabet Code of Conduct. We have also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which, in conjunction with our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and charters of the standing committees
of our Board of Directors, form the framework for our corporate governance. The Alphabet Code of Conduct and our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at https://abc.xyz/investor/. We will

    Stockholder Recommendations and Nominees   
 Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a standing committee of our Board of Directors, considers properly submitted recommendations for
candidates to our Board of Directors from stockholders. In evaluating such recommendations, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to achieve a balance of experience, knowledge, integrity, and capability on our Board of Directors
and to address the membership criteria set forth under  Director Selection Process and Qualifications  on page 6. Any stockholder recommendations for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee should include
the candidate s name, biographical information, information regarding any relationships between the candidate and the Company within the last three years, at least three personal references, a statement of recommendation of the candidate from
the stockholder, a description of our shares beneficially owned by the stockholder, a description of all arrangements between the candidate and the recommending stockholder and any other person pursuant to which the candidate is being recommended, a
written indication of the candidate s willingness to serve on our Board of Directors, any other information required to be provided under securities laws and regulations, and a written indication to provide such other information as the

   In addition, our bylaws permit stockholders to nominate directors for consideration at an annual meeting.  
  Director Selection Process and Qualifications     Our Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate and recommend candidates for membership on our Board of Directors consistent with criteria established by our Board of Directors in our policy with regard to the selection of director nominees.
Pursuant to this policy, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee screens candidates and evaluates the qualifications of the persons nominated by or recommended by our stockholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
recommends director nominees who are ultimately approved by the full Board of Directors.    Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses a
variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for directors. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly assesses the appropriate size and composition of the Board of Directors, the needs of the Board of Directors and
the respective committees of the Board of Directors, and the qualifications of candidates in light of these needs. Candidates may come to the attention of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee through stockholders, management, current
members of the Board of Directors, or search firms. The evaluation of these candidates may be based solely upon information provided to the committee or may also include discussions with persons familiar with the candidate, an interview of the
candidate, or other actions the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee deems appropriate, including the use of third parties to review candidates. The Nominating and Corporate Governance committee may, at Alphabet s expense, retain
search firms, consultants, and other advisors to identify, screen, and/or evaluate candidates.    When considering a potential non-incumbent
candidate, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will factor into its determination the following qualities, among others: integrity, professional reputation and strength of character, educational background, knowledge of our business,
diversity of professional experience, including whether the person is a current or former chief executive officer or chief financial officer of a public company or the head of a division of a large international organization, and ability to
represent the best interests of our stockholders and to provide practical insights and diverse perspectives. Additionally, due to the global and complex nature of our business, our Board of Directors believes it is important to consider diversity of
race, ethnicity, gender, age, education, cultural background, and professional experiences in evaluating board candidates, although our policy does not prescribe specific standards for diversity. Candidates also are evaluated in light of our other
policies, such as those relating to independence and service on other boards, as well as considerations relating to the size, structure, and needs of our Board of Directors. As part of its consideration of director succession, our Board of Directors
and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee monitor whether the directors as a group meet the criteria for the composition of the Board of Directors, including overall diversity of perspective and experience.  
 Our Board of Directors is composed of a diverse group of leaders in their respective fields. Many of the current directors have senior leadership
experience at major domestic and international companies. In these positions, they have also gained experience in core management skills, such as strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting, compliance, risk management,
leadership development, and international business experience. Most of our directors also have experience serving on boards of directors and board committees of other public companies, and have an understanding of corporate governance practices and
trends, different business processes, challenges, and strategies. Other directors have experience as presidents or trustees of significant academic, research, and philanthropic institutions, which brings unique perspectives to the Board of
Directors. Further, our directors also have other experience that makes them valuable members, such as entrepreneurial experience and experience developing technology or managing technology companies, which provides insight into strategic and
operational issues faced by us.       The Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the above-mentioned attributes, along with the leadership skills and other experiences of our board members described below, provide us with a diverse range of perspectives and judgment necessary to
guide our strategies and monitor their execution.

Item 11.  
  Executive Compensation.        Compensation Discussion and Analysis   
  Overview     Our Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD A)
includes a detailed discussion of compensation for seven named executive officers during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015:      

Larry Page  
    
 Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Alphabet and Co-Founder  

Sergey Brin  
    
 President, Alphabet and Co-Founder  

Eric E. Schmidt  
    
 Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors (Executive Chairman)  

Sundar Pichai  
    
 Chief Executive Officer, Google as of October 2, 2015 (previously Senior Vice President, Products of Google)  

Ruth M. Porat  
    
 Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Alphabet as of October 2, 2015, and Google as of May 26, 2015  

Patrick Pichette  
    
 Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Google until May 26, 2015  

Omid Kordestani  
    
 Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Google through October 1, 2015  
   The CD A is organized into five sections:      

Section 1 Executive Summary        

Section 2 Elements of Pay        

Section 3 Determining Competitive Levels of Pay        

Section 4 Pay Mix, Magnitude, and Leverage        

Section 5 Other Compensation Information       Section 1 Executive Summary   
 We designed our compensation programs for our Alphabet and Google employees, including our named executive officers, to support three goals:  

Attract and retain the world s best talent        

Support our culture of innovation and performance        

Align employee and stockholder interests      We pay employees competitively compared to other
opportunities they might have in the market. We also offer competitive benefits to promote the health and happiness of our employees, provide unique perks that make life and work more convenient, design compelling job opportunities aligned with our
mission, and create a fun and energizing work environment.    We believe deeply in paying for performance. Therefore, a portion of compensation is
tied to performance for all employees. The proportion of overall pay tied to performance is higher for employees at more senior levels in the organization, reflecting their opportunity for higher impact on company performance.  
 We use equity awards to align employee and stockholder interests. We require most of our senior executives to maintain holdings of Alphabet stock. See
Section 5 of this CD A for a description of our stock ownership requirements.  
      8  

Table of Contents  

  Larry and Sergey have voluntarily elected to only receive nominal cash compensation. As significant
stockholders, a large portion of their personal wealth is tied directly to Alphabet s stock price performance, which provides direct alignment with stockholder interests.  
 In addition to compensation practices, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee regularly reviews and provides guidance to Alphabet s
organizational decisions as laid out in its charter (available at https://abc.xyz/investor/other/board.html#leadership-committee).     Section 2 Elements
of Pay     In 2015, we offered base salary and equity awards to our named executive officers. Eric also received a cash bonus award.  
 In March 2015, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee made changes to the compensation structure for Alphabet s executive officers.
Beginning in 2016, executive officers will no longer receive cash bonuses and will receive all variable pay through equity awards. See  Cash Incentives  and  Equity  under Section 4 of the CD A for additional details.
     Base Salary      We use salary to
provide employees, including our named executive officers, a steady income in line with their skills, experiences, and job opportunities available to them outside of Alphabet.  
 Upon reviewing the pay practices of our talent competitors and the compensation preferences of our employees, we continue to believe that competitive
salaries are important for attracting and retaining great talent.      Equity Awards    
 We reinforce management s focus on long-term stockholder value and commitment to the company through equity compensation programs that include the
following features:      

Biennial equity awards  Standard equity awards to our named executive officers are made only in even-numbered years. Granting less frequently allows us to incorporate longer performance periods into
our equity decisions and encourages executives to take a long-term view of the business.        

Minimum stock ownership requirements  We require minimum stock ownership as follows: (i) Larry, Sergey and Eric shall each own shares of Alphabet common stock worth at least $14.0 million;
(ii) Sundar and each executive officer shall own shares of Alphabet common stock worth at least $4.0 million; and (iii) each member of our Board of Directors shall own shares of Alphabet common stock worth at least $750,000.
     In 2015, we did not grant regular biennial equity awards to our named executive officers.  
   Role of Company Performance      The
Leadership Development and Compensation Committee holds our named executive officers accountable for Alphabet s company-wide performance (including Alphabet s financial and operational performance and progress against company-wide
strategic goals) and bases a portion of their compensation on such performance. We use company performance as an input in deciding each named executive officer s equity awards.  
   Role of Individual Performance      The
company-wide operational, strategic, and financial goals we set at the beginning of the year serve as the foundation for the personal goals set by each employee (in partnership with their manager). Managers review the performance of employees
against these goals annually.  
      9  

Table of Contents  

  For our named executive officers, Larry assesses their performance against each officer s goals. While
informed by objective goals, Larry s assessments are subjective, considering a complete picture of the named executive officer s accomplishments. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee discusses these appraisals with Larry
when reviewing proposed equity awards for each named executive officer.     Section 3 Determining Competitive Levels of Pay   
 Our executive compensation decisions are informed by market data in addition to reviews of individual roles and performance. We use peer group data to
obtain a compensation benchmark for our named executive officers in their current roles by reviewing the data reported in our peer companies  SEC filings.  
 In 2015, we considered peers to be companies that met at least three of the following criteria:  

High-technology or media company        

Key talent competitor        

High-growth, with a minimum of 50% of Alphabet s revenue and/or headcount growth over the previous two-year period        

$10 billion or more in annual revenue        

$50 billion or more in market capitalization      Based on these criteria, the Leadership Development
and Compensation Committee selected the following companies as peer companies for 2015:      

Amazon.com, Inc. 
    
 Hewlett-Packard Company 
    
 Oracle Corporation  

Apple Inc. 
    
 Intel Corporation 
    
 Qualcomm, Inc.  

Cisco Systems, Inc. 
    
 International Business Machines Corporation 
    
 The Walt Disney Company  

eBay, Inc. 
    
 Microsoft Corporation 
    
 Yahoo! Inc.  

Facebook, Inc. 

Overall, we retained the same peer group in 2015 as in 2014.  
 When appropriate, we supplement publicly available data with relevant published survey sources, including surveys from Radford and Towers Watson. In
addition, we consider job opportunities available to our named executive officers if they were to leave Alphabet. Therefore, we also assess compensation levels for our named executive officers against comparable roles at other S P 500 companies
and potential equity opportunities at startup organizations.    The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee does not utilize the services of
an outside compensation consultant to assess pay levels.      Role of Management in Determining Compensation    
 Annually, Larry and the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee review our executive compensation practices against our market targets and
benchmark data. Larry then makes compensation recommendations to the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee for our named executive officers, other than himself. Any changes to pay practices for our named executive officers must be
approved by the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee before implementation.

    Say-on-Pay    
 We hold our say-on-pay votes every three years. We will hold both our next say-on-pay vote and advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes
(commonly known as a  say-when-on-pay  vote) at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee annually reevaluates our compensation practices to determine how they might be improved.  
  Section 4 Pay Mix, Magnitude, and Leverage   
   Pay Mix      Our named executive officers
receive the majority of their pay from equity compensation, consistent with market benchmarks. As our biennial grants are made in even-numbered years, the value of equity compensation is not fully demonstrated in the 2015 pay mix, with the exception
of Sundar and Ruth, who received special one-time equity awards in 2015 (see  Equity  section below for further details). Larry and Sergey declined to receive performance-based compensation.  
 The table below shows 2015 pay mix details, including salaries, actual bonuses, and the fair value of equity awards made in 2015. The table does not
include any other compensation disclosed in the  All Other Compensation  column of our Summary Compensation Table.      2015 ACTUAL

     Base Salary    
 We set salaries for our named executive officers based on their responsibilities and trends we observe in the market (see Section 3 of this
CD A,  Determining Competitive Levels of Pay  for further details). We review salaries at least once a year and adjust them as needed.  
 In 2004, Larry and Sergey asked that their salaries each be reduced to $1 per year. Since 2005, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee
has offered them market-competitive salaries annually. For 2015, Larry and Sergey once again declined our salary offers and therefore receive salaries of $1 each.  
 In 2015, Larry reviewed the market benchmarks for our other named executive officers and recommended that we hold salaries constant at 2014 levels.
Based on this assessment, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee decided to maintain salaries for our named executive officers (other than Larry, Sergey, and Eric) at $650,000.  
 We set Eric s salary at a higher level than our other named executive officers based on market benchmarks for the Executive Chairman role. Since
transitioning to his current role as Executive Chairman in 2011, Eric has received a salary of $1.25 million, which we maintained in 2015.

    Cash Incentives    
 In March 2015, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee changed the compensation structure for Alphabet s executive officers. The new
structure eliminates annual cash bonuses beginning in 2016 (for the 2015 performance year), shifting to only salary and biennial equity grants. This change does not apply to Larry, Sergey, and Eric, who were each still eligible to receive annual
cash bonuses in respect of their performance in 2015.    Of our named executive officers, only Eric received an annual cash bonus based on his
performance in 2015. Eric s bonus target was 400% of his salary with annual payments that can range from zero to a maximum of $6.0 million. Given Eric s contributions leading our Board of Directors and managing complex stakeholder
relationships during 2015, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee approved a cash bonus of $6.0 million, equal to each of Eric s last four annual bonuses. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee offered Larry and
Sergey cash bonuses in recognition of their performance in 2015; however, they declined to receive the bonuses.    The Leadership Development and
Compensation Committee may also pay other discretionary bonuses unrelated to our annual cash bonus program. In May 2015, Ruth Porat joined us as CFO. As an inducement, we paid Ruth a sign-on bonus of $5.0 million in 2015. The award is shown in the
table below as well as in the Summary Compensation Table under the  Bonus  column.

Equity    
 Our current practice is to grant GSUs as equity awards to employees. We do not grant any other equity vehicles at this time, although our practice may
change in the future. Equity awards to our named executive officers (other than Larry, Sergey, and Eric) are generally granted biennially and vest over four years. Eric s award is intended to be granted every four years, and vests quarterly
over four years.    In March 2015, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee changed the equity vesting schedule for biennial equity
grants to Alphabet s executive officers. Future biennial equity grants will vest quarterly over a four-year period.    In January 2015, the
Leadership Development and Compensation Committee granted a $100.0 million equity award to Sundar in recognition of his performance and increased responsibilities as the leader of all Google s technical product areas. In January 2016, following
his promotion to Chief Executive Officer of Google, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee granted a $209.0 million biennial equity award to Sundar, which vests over four years.  
 The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee views Sundar s retention as critical to Google s success, as demonstrated by his
promotion to CEO in October 2015, and believes that this level of compensation is representative of his value and the opportunities available to him outside of Alphabet.  
 In June 2015, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee granted a $25.0 million equity award to Ruth upon hire. The Leadership Development
and Compensation Committee believes this award will deliver equity compensation commensurate with the responsibilities of the CFO role until biennial equity awards granted to executive officers in 2016 begin to vest.  
      12  

Table of Contents  

  Upon Patrick and Omid s respective departures, all of their outstanding equity was cancelled and we
made cash payments equal to the value of their unvested biennial equity grants, prorated for the time between the grant date and the cancellation date. The payments equaled $56.2 million to Patrick and $16.3 million to Omid.  
 Larry and Sergey did not hold any stock options, GSUs, or other contingent stock rights at the end of 2015. The Leadership Development and Compensation
Committee will continue to review their compensation on an ongoing basis and may recommend future equity awards.     Section 5 Other Compensation
Information     The first four sections of this CD A describe how we think about compensation and how that affects our pay practices. Other
compensation-related details that may be important considerations for our investors are discussed below.      Risk Considerations    
 The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee reviewed our compensation programs for employees and concluded that these programs do not create
risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.    The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee believes
that the design of our annual and long-term incentives focuses performance on long-term value creation and discourages short-term risks at the expense of long-term results. A substantial portion of employees  compensation is delivered in the
form of equity awards, further aligning their interests with those of stockholders.    The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee believes
that the following risk oversight and compensation design features safeguard against excessive risk-taking:      

The Board of Directors as a whole has responsibility for risk oversight, regularly reviewing reports on the deliberations of Board committees. In addition, the Board reviews the strategic, financial, and
execution risks and exposures associated with the financial, operational, and capital decisions that serve as inputs to our compensation programs.        

The majority of compensation provided to our named executive officers is performance-based. Our named executive officers are motivated to carefully assess risks to protect their compensation.    

Through discussions with Larry, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee gains insight into a reasonable range of future company performance expectations. The information is incorporated into
decisions regarding equity awards to our named executive officers.        

Given that equity compensation comprises a high percentage of our named executive officers  overall pay:        

Our equity awards are subject to vesting conditions that mitigate the potential for decisions that benefit short-term results but that may not be consistent with our long-term interests.    

Equity awards typically vest over a four-year period to ensure our named executive officers have significant value tied to long-term stock price performance.    

Our named executive officers are subject to minimum stock ownership guidelines. This ensures that each named executive officer will hold a significant amount of our equity to further align his or her interests with
those of our stockholders over the long term.        

We prohibit all speculative and hedging transactions involving our securities. As a result, our named executive officers cannot insulate themselves from the effects of poor stock price performance.    

We have internal controls over financial reporting, the measurement and calculation of performance relative to goals, and other financial, operational, and compliance policies and practices designed to protect our
compensation programs from manipulation by any employee.    
      13  

Table of Contents  

    Timing of Equity Award Grants    
 The effective grant date for all equity awards to employees, members of our Board of Directors, and non-employee advisors is the first Wednesday of the
month following the date on which the equity award is approved by the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee, unless otherwise specified by our Board of Directors or the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee.  
 The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee does not grant equity compensation awards in anticipation of the release of material nonpublic
information. Similarly, we do not time the release of material nonpublic information based on equity award grant dates.      Minimum Stock
Ownership Guidelines      To align our named executive officers  and directors  interests with those of our stockholders, the Board of
Directors has instituted minimum stock ownership requirements under our Corporate Governance Guidelines.    Our current stock ownership guidelines
are: (i) Larry, Sergey and Eric shall each own Alphabet stock worth at least $14.0 million; (ii) Sundar and each executive officer shall own Alphabet stock worth at least $4.0 million; and (iii) each director shall own Alphabet stock
worth at least $750,000.    Executive officers have five years from hire or promotion to the Senior Vice President level to comply with the stock
ownership requirements. Each director has five years from the time he or she becomes a director to comply with these ownership requirements.    All of
our named executive officers and directors either met the applicable minimum stock ownership guidelines as of December 31, 2015 or were within the time period noted above to come into compliance with these requirements.  
   Transactions in Company Securities    
 Our insider trading policy prohibits employees and directors from engaging in any speculative or hedging transactions in our securities. We prohibit
hedging transactions such as puts, calls, collars, swaps, forward sale contracts, exchange funds, and similar arrangements or instruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of Alphabet s securities. No employee or
director may engage in short sales of Alphabet securities, hold Alphabet securities in a margin account, or pledge Alphabet securities as collateral for a loan.  
   Post-Employment and Change in Control Payments    
 We have no agreements with our named executive officers that provide for additional or accelerated compensation upon termination of the executive s
employment or a change in control of Alphabet, except as set forth below.    Upon a change in control of Alphabet and, unless our Board of Directors
or Leadership Development and Compensation Committee determines otherwise, if the successor corporation does not assume or substitute the equity awards held by our employees, including our named executive officers, all unvested stock options and
unvested GSUs will fully vest.    The table below shows our estimates of the value each of our named executive officers would have received if their
unvested stock options and unvested GSUs as of December 31, 2015 had become fully vested as a result of a change in control.  
      14  

Table of Contents  

  The estimated benefit amount of unvested stock options was calculated by multiplying the number of unvested
stock options by the excess of the closing prices of our Class A common stock or Class C capital stock on December 31, 2015, which were $778.01 per share and $758.88 per share, respectively, over the exercise price of the option. The
estimated benefit amount of unvested GSUs was calculated by multiplying the number of unvested GSUs by the closing price of our Class A common stock or Class C capital stock on December 31, 2015, which were $778.01 per share and $758.88
per share, respectively.      
     Deductibility of Executive Compensation    
 Section 162(m) of the Code may preclude us from deducting certain compensation in excess of $1.0 million per year to our named executive officers,
unless such compensation meets the requirements of  qualified performance-based compensation  under Section 162(m). Eric s annual cash bonus for the 2015 fiscal year does not meet the requirements of  qualified
performance-based compensation.  Therefore, this bonus will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes to the extent that it, when combined with other 2015 compensation for the applicable named executive officer that does not meet such
requirements (e.g., base salary, GSUs that vested and were settled in 2015), exceeds $1.0 million.      Perquisites and Other Benefits
     Like all employees, our named executive officers are eligible to participate in various employee benefit plans, including medical, dental,
and vision care plans, flexible spending accounts for health and dependent care, life, accidental death and dismemberment, disability, and travel insurance, survivor income benefit, employee assistance programs (e.g., confidential counseling), and
paid time off. We also paid life insurance premiums for all employees (other than Larry and Sergey).    In addition, we maintain a tax qualified
401(k) retirement savings plan with both pre-tax and after-tax Roth savings features for eligible employees, including our named executive officers. In 2015, we provided a company match equal to the greater of 100% of contributions up to $3,000, or
50% of the maximum contribution under the Code ($18,000) for a maximum match of $9,000, per employee (other than Larry and Sergey). Our company match is fully vested at the time of contribution. Participants are not taxed on their pre-tax
contributions or earnings on those contributions until distribution, but pre-tax contributions and all company matching contributions are deductible by us when made. Participants are taxed on their after-tax Roth contributions, and all company
matching contributions and after-tax Roth contributions are deductible by us when made.    In 2015, we paid for personal security for Eric and
incremental costs related to the personal use of non-commercial aircraft for Eric, Sundar, Ruth, and Omid. Pursuant to our Non-Commercial Aircraft Policy, named executive officers and their guests may use company aircraft with appropriate approvals
and pay tax on any associated imputed income.

    Deferred Compensation Plan    
 We maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for most of our U.S.-based employees. As CFOs, both Ruth and Patrick were ineligible to
participate in the deferred compensation plan. The plan allows participants to defer up to 100% of their bonus for a period of three, four, or five years, subject to certain exceptions. The deferred compensation plan is unfunded and unsecured, and
participation is voluntary. We do not provide any matching contributions to the deferred compensation plan.    In 2015, Eric was the only named
executive officer to defer his bonus under this plan. See the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation table on page 21 for further information regarding Eric s bonus deferral.  
   No Additional Executive Benefit Plans    
 Since we do not generally differentiate the benefits we offer our named executive officers from the benefits we offer other employees, we do not maintain
any benefit plans that cover only select named executive officers. We also do not maintain any executive retirement programs such as executive pension plans or supplemental executive retirement plans.

   Leadership Development and Compensation Committee Report   
 The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on its
review and discussions with management, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Amendment to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and in our proxy statement for the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.    LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

   2015 Summary Compensation Table   
 The following table sets forth information regarding the compensation paid to, or earned by, our named executive officers for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015.      

(1) 
 Salaries reflect amounts earned by the named executive officers in the relevant fiscal year. Includes amounts deferred pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code.    

(2) 
 The amounts in the Bonus column consist of the annual cash bonuses paid to named executive officers for performance in the relevant fiscal year. Includes amounts deferred pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code. For
Eric, also includes amounts deferred pursuant to our non-qualified deferred compensation plan.    

(3) 
 Amounts reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of GSUs computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and are not necessarily an indication of actual gains from previously granted equity awards. The grant date fair
value of each GSU award is measured based on the closing price of our Class A common stock or Class C capital stock, as applicable, on the date of grant.    
      18  

Table of Contents  

(4) 
 All other compensation generally consists of the Company s 401(k) company match of up to $9,000, life insurance premiums paid by the Company for the benefit of the named executive officer, personal use of company
aircraft, and the market value of a holiday gift given to each employee, net of tax withholding, unless otherwise noted. The aggregate incremental cost of personal use of the company aircraft is calculated based on a cost-per-flight-hour charge
developed by a nationally recognized and independent service. The charge reflects the direct operating cost of the aircraft, including fuel, additives and lubricants, an allocable allowance for airframe, engine and APU maintenance and restoration,
crew travel expenses, on board catering, and trip-related landing/hangar/ramp fees and parking costs. This charge does not include any fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as pilots  and other employees  salaries, home
hanger expenses, and general taxes and insurance.    

(5) 
 Larry and Sergey each receive $1 in base salary and do not participate in our cash bonus program or our equity programs.    

(11) 
 Includes a $56,208,902 cash payment, made upon Patrick s departure, following the cancellation of his outstanding and unvested equity grants.    

(13) 
 Includes a $16,309,118 cash payment, made upon Omid s departure, following the cancellation of his outstanding and unvested equity grants.    
  Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2015     The
following table provides information regarding the amount of equity awards granted in 2015 for each of the named executive officers.      

(1) 
 Stock awards (GSUs) are shown at their aggregate grant date fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The fair value of each GSU award is measured based on the closing price of our Class C capital stock on the
date of grant.    

(2) 
 The exact number of GSUs comprising the equity award was calculated by dividing the target GSU grant value by the closing price of our Class C capital stock on January 6, 2015, rounding to the nearest whole share
number.    

(3) 
 The exact number of GSUs comprising the equity award was calculated by dividing the target GSU grant value by the closing price of our Class C capital stock on June 2, 2015, rounding to the nearest whole share
number.       Description of Plan-Based Awards   
 The GSUs granted to Sundar and Ruth in fiscal year 2015 were granted under the 2012 Stock Plan and are governed by the terms of the 2012 Stock Plan and
the applicable award agreements. See footnotes to the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2015 Fiscal Year-End table below for a description of the vesting schedule of the GSUs reported in the Grant of Plan-Based Awards in 2015 table above.

   Outstanding Equity Awards at 2015 Fiscal Year-End   
 The following table provides information on the current holdings of stock options and unvested GSUs by our named executive officers at December 31,
2015.      

(1) 
 The option exercise prices have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the April 2, 2014 Stock Split.    

(2) 
 The market value of unvested GSUs is calculated by multiplying the number of unvested GSUs held by the applicable named executive officer by the closing price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, as
applicable, on December 31, 2015, which were $778.01 per share and $758.88 per share, respectively.    

(3) 
 This award vests as follows: 1/16th of GSUs vested on May 25, 2015 and an additional 1/16th will vest quarterly thereafter until the units are fully vested, subject to continued employment on such vesting dates.

(4) 
 This award vests as follows: 1/8th of GSUs vested on March 25, 2015 and an additional 1/8th will vest quarterly thereafter until the units are fully vested, subject to continued employment on such vesting dates.

(7) 
 This award vests as follows: 1/72 of GSUs vested on May 25, 2013 and an additional 1/72 will vest monthly thereafter until the units are fully vested, subject to continued employment on such vesting dates.

(8) 
 This award vests as follows: 1/5th of GSUs vested on December 25, 2015 and an additional 1/10th will vest quarterly thereafter until the units are fully vested, subject to continued employment on such vesting
dates.

   Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal 2015   
 The following table provides information for the named executive officers on stock option exercises during the year ended December 31, 2015,
including the number of shares acquired upon exercise and the value realized, before payment of any applicable withholding tax and broker commissions, and GSUs that vested during the same period.  

(1) 
 The value realized on exercise is calculated as the product of (a) the number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class C capital stock, as applicable, for which the stock options were exercised and
(b) the excess of the closing price of our Class A common stock or Class C capital stock, as applicable, on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of the exercise over the applicable exercise price per share of the stock options.       

(2) 
 The value realized on vesting is calculated as the product of (a) the number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class C capital stock, as applicable, underlying the GSUs that vested and (b) the
closing price of our Class A common stock or Class C capital stock, as applicable, on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the day before vesting.    
  Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation     The
following table provides information about contributions, earnings, and balances under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan in fiscal year 2015. We do not provide matching contributions to the deferred compensation plan, and in fiscal year
2015 there were no withdrawals by or distributions to our named executive officers.      

(1) 
 The amount reported under Executive Contributions in 2015 is the amount that the named executive officers elected to defer under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. This amount represents compensation earned
in 2015 and is therefore also reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table.    

(2) 
 The amount reported under Aggregate Earnings in 2015 shows the net amount credited to each officer s account as a result of the performance of the investment vehicle in which his or her account was deemed invested.
This amount does not represent  above-market  earnings, and thus is not reported in the Summary Compensation Table.    
      21  

Table of Contents  

Our deferred compensation plan is unfunded and unsecured, and participation is voluntary. Most U.S.-based employees are eligible to participate in the
deferred compensation plan. As CFOs, both Ruth and Patrick were ineligible to participate in the deferred compensation plan. The plan allows participants to defer a specified percentage (up to 100%) of their bonus for a period of three, four or five
years, subject to certain exceptions. During the deferral period, the deferred amounts are hypothetically or  notionally  invested in one or more investments funds selected by the committee administering the deferred compensation plan.
Each participant s account is adjusted for gains or losses at least annually based on the rate of gain or loss on the assets in each notional investment fund. We do not guarantee any returns on participant contributions. If a participant s
employment terminates, distribution is made in the form of a lump sum following termination.    In 2015, Eric was the only named executive officer to
defer his bonus under this plan.     Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control   
 We have no agreements with any of our named executive officers that provide for additional or accelerated compensation on the termination of the
executive s employment or a change in control of the Company, except as set forth under  Post-Employment and Change in Control Payments  on page 14.

   DIRECTOR COMPENSATION   
  Board Compensation Arrangements for Non-Employee Directors   
 Alphabet s director compensation program is designed to attract and retain highly qualified non-employee directors. Our program aligns director
compensation with compensation offered by peer companies (identified in Section 3 of the  Compensation Discussion and Analysis  under  Executive Compensation ) that compete with us for talent.  
 We designed the program to address the time, effort, expertise, and accountability required of active board membership. Our Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee and Leadership Development and Compensation Committee believe that annual compensation for non-employee directors should consist of both cash to compensate members for their service on the Board of Directors and its committees,
and equity to align the interests of directors and stockholders. By vesting over time, equity also creates an incentive for continued service on our Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Leadership Development
and Compensation Committee review the compensation programs for non-employee directors on an annual basis.    In 2015, we did not make any changes to
our standard compensation arrangements and practices for non-employee directors. We awarded our standard ongoing compensation to each of our non-employee directors, including an annual $75,000 cash retainer and an annual $350,000 GSU grant. In
addition, we paid a $25,000 annual cash retainer to the Audit Committee chairperson. We awarded cash retainers and GSU grants to our non-employee directors on July 1, 2015, the first Wednesday of the month following our 2015 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.    The exact number of GSUs comprising the equity awards is calculated by dividing the target dollar value of the award by the closing
price of Alphabet s Class C capital stock on the day prior to grant and rounding up to the nearest whole share. All annual GSU grants made to our non-employee directors vest at the rate of 1/48 th
 monthly, beginning on the 25 th  day of the month following the grant date until fully vested, subject to continued service on our Board of Directors through the applicable vesting dates.  
 We reimburse our non-employee directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with attendance at Board of Directors and committee
meetings.    Larry, Sergey, Eric, and Diane are our employee directors. In 2015, Larry and Sergey did not receive any compensation for their services
as members of our Board of Directors. Please see the section titled  Executive Compensation  for more information about compensation paid to Eric, who serves as the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors.  
 On December 17, 2015, Diane joined Google as a Senior Vice President. Prior to joining Google as an employee, Diane received our standard
non-employee director compensation. Diane has retained her position on our Board of Directors since becoming a Google employee, but will not receive any compensation for her service as a member of our Board of Directors.

   Director Compensation for 2015   
 The following table summarizes compensation earned by non-employee directors during 2015.  

(1) 
 The amounts in the Stock Awards column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of GSUs granted to directors in 2015 calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The grant date fair value of GSUs granted to the
then non-employee directors on July 1, 2015 (GSU grant following the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders) was $521.84 per share.

Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation     During 2015, L. John Doerr, Paul S. Otellini, and K. Ram Shriram served on the Leadership
Development and Compensation Committee. L. John Doerr served on the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee until December 17, 2015. None of the members of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee has been an officer or
employee of Alphabet. None of our executive officers serves on the board of directors or compensation committee of a company that has an executive officer that serves on our board of directors or the Leadership Development and Compensation

Item 12.  
  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.     
 The following table sets forth information, as of December 31, 2015, concerning, except as indicated by the footnotes below:  

Each person whom we know beneficially owns more than five percent of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock.        

Each of our directors.        

Each of our named executive officers (see the section titled  Executive Compensation  beginning on page 8).        

All of our directors and executive officers as a group.      Unless otherwise noted below, the address of
each beneficial owner listed in the table is c/o Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043.    We have determined
beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment
power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws.    As of October 2,
2015, Alphabet became the successor issuer to, and parent holding company of, Google pursuant to a holding company reorganization in which all of Google s outstanding shares were automatically converted into equivalent corresponding shares of
Alphabet. Applicable percentage ownership is based on 292,296,901 shares of Class A common stock and 50,294,813 shares of Class B common stock outstanding at December 31, 2015. In computing the number of shares of Class A and Class B
common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares of Class A common stock subject to options held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within sixty days
of December 31, 2015, and Class A common stock issuable upon the vesting of Google Stock Units (GSUs) within sixty days of December 31, 2015, to be outstanding ignoring the withholding of shares of common stock to cover applicable
taxes. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. GSUs entitle the beneficial owner to receive one share of Class A common stock for each share underlying the
GSU as the GSU vests. Beneficial ownership representing less than one percent is denoted with an asterisk (*).

Item 13.  
  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.        Director
Independence     Our Board of Directors has adopted independence standards that mirror exactly the criteria specified by applicable laws and
regulations of the SEC and the Listing Rules of NASDAQ. Our Board of Directors has determined that each of the director nominees standing for election, except Larry, Sergey, Eric, and Diane, is an independent director under these standards. In
determining the independence of our directors, our Board of Directors considered all transactions in which we and any director had any interest, including those discussed under  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions  on
pages 29-32, transactions involving payments made by us to companies in the ordinary course of business where certain of our directors serve on the board of directors or as a member of the executive management team of the other company, and
transactions involving payments made by us to educational institutions with director affiliations.       Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions      Related Party Transactions Policy and Procedure   
 Our written Related Party Transactions Policy provides that we will only enter into or ratify a transaction with a related party when our board of
directors, acting through the Audit Committee, determines that the transaction is in the best interests of Alphabet and our stockholders.    For the
purposes of this policy, a related party means:      

a member of the board of directors (or a nominee to the board of directors);        

an executive officer;        

any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of our securities;        

any immediate family member of any of the persons listed above; or        

any firm, corporation, partnership, or other entity in which any of the persons listed above is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which any of the persons listed above has a five percent or
greater beneficial ownership interest.      We review all known relationships and transactions in which Alphabet and our directors,
executive officers, and significant stockholders or their immediate family members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect interest. Our legal staff, in consultation with our finance team, is primarily
responsible for developing and implementing processes and controls to obtain information regarding our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders with respect to related party transactions and then determining, based on the facts
and circumstances, whether Alphabet or a related party has a direct or indirect interest in these transactions. On a periodic basis, the legal and finance teams review all transactions involving payments between Alphabet and any company that has our
executive officer or director as an officer or director. In addition, our directors and executive officers are required to notify us of any potential related party transactions and provide us with the information regarding such transactions.  
 If our legal department determines that a transaction is a related party transaction, the Audit Committee must review the transaction and either approve
or disapprove it. If advance approval of a transaction is not feasible, the chair of the Audit Committee may approve the transaction, and the Audit Committee may ratify the transaction in accordance with the Related Party Transactions Policy. In
determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction with a related party, the Audit Committee will take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances available to it, including, among any other factors it deems appropriate:  

the benefits to us of the transaction;        

the nature of the related party s interest in the transaction;        

whether the transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act in the best interests of Alphabet and our stockholders;    
      29  

Table of Contents  

the potential impact of the transaction on a director s independence; and        

whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances.    
 Any member of the Audit Committee who is a related party with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the deliberations or vote on
the approval of the transaction.     Related Party Transactions   
  Indemnification Agreements     We have entered into an
indemnification agreement with each of our directors and executive officers. The indemnification agreements, our certificate of incorporation, and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware law.     Corporate Use of Personal Aircraft     Eric
E. Schmidt beneficially owns 100% of one aircraft and 33% of another aircraft, both of which are used by Eric and our other executive officers from time to time for business trips. The reimbursement rate for use of these aircraft is $7,500 per hour.
Our Board of Directors approved this hourly reimbursement rate based upon a competitive analysis of comparable chartered aircraft rates that showed that the reimbursement rate is at or below market rates for the charter of similar aircraft. In 2015,
we used these aircraft for business-related travel services for certain of our executive officers, including Eric, and we reimbursed Eric approximately $396,000. Due to the fact that the $7,500 hourly rate paid for the use of these aircraft is less
than the actual operational costs incurred by Eric as owner of these aircraft, Eric does not profit from the use of these aircraft.     Use of Moffett Airfield
    Pursuant to a 60-year lease agreement with NASA in early 2015, we became the operator of Moffett Airfield (the Airfield). Larry, Sergey, Eric,
and Ram, through their affiliated entities (the Founder Entities), have historically used and paid to NASA applicable fees for the use of the Airfield for their personal aircraft. As the operator of the Airfield, we charge the Founder Entities fees
for the use of the Airfield that are (i) non-preferential when compared to the fees charged to other private customers landing aircraft at the Airfield, and (ii) derived from rate schedules that are consistent with what an independent
airfield services company believes, based on its industry experience, to be arm s-length terms that are fair and reasonable to us as the operator. In 2015, we charged the Founder Entities approximately $1,725,722. These flights have not
interfered with our business plans for use of the Airfield. These fees will be regularly reviewed by our Audit Committee. Larry, Sergey, Eric, and Ram do not have a material interest in any of the transactions described above.  
  Payments to Stanford University     In 2015, we paid
approximately $5.7 million to Stanford University. Of this amount, approximately $1.6 million primarily represented donations for scholarships and other philanthropic endeavors and approximately $4.1 million for research, research materials,
licensing, consulting, and engineering services.    John L. Hennessy, President of Stanford University, is a member of our Board of Directors. Ruth M.
Porat, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, is Vice Chair of the Stanford University board of trustees. In addition, K. Ram Shriram, a member of our Board of Directors, serves on the Stanford University board of trustees. Omid
Kordestani, our former Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer, serves as a member of the Stanford Graduate School of Business Advisory Board. John, Ruth, Ram, and Omid do not have a material interest in any of the transactions described
above.     Acquisition of bebop Technologies, Inc.     On
December 17, 2015, we acquired bebop Technologies, Inc. (bebop) for $411,598,500 (including payments subject to continued employment) in Alphabet Class C capital stock and cash, subject to indemnification obligations, escrow, and vesting. One
of our directors, Diane Greene, was the CEO, a member of the board of directors and a stockholder of bebop. Diane s husband, Mendel Rosenblum, was also an employee and stockholder of bebop. Diane and Mendel will receive an aggregate of
$157,074,521 in Alphabet Class C capital stock and cash in exchange for their shares in bebop, a  
      30

portion of which is subject to indemnification obligations, escrow, and vesting. Diane and Mendel intend to donate all of the merger consideration received pursuant to the bebop transaction to a
donor advised fund. In connection with the bebop transaction, Diane became a Google Senior Vice President. Mendel has been employed in a non-executive capacity by Google since the consummation of the bebop transaction. Diane s 2015 total
compensation received from Google in connection with her employment is set forth in  Director Compensation for 2015  on page 24.  
 Diane was recused from all Board of Directors and Committee discussions relating to the bebop acquisition and the terms of Diane and Mendel s
employment. The independent members of our Board of Directors determined that the terms of the transaction and employment arrangements were arm s-length as well as fair and reasonable to us.  
  Investments in Certain Private Companies     GV directly
invested an aggregate of approximately $39.7 million in certain private companies from the beginning of 2015 through January 31, 2016, in which Kleiner Perkins Caufield   Byers was a co-investor or existing investor. KPCB Holdings,
Inc., as nominee for certain funds of Kleiner Perkins Caufield   Byers and several of the managers of the fund, holds more than 10% of the outstanding shares of such private companies. L. John Doerr, who is a member of our Board of
Directors, is a managing director/member of the managing members of those funds and the general partner of the general partners of certain Kleiner Perkins Caufield   Byers funds. John does not have a material interest in any of the
transactions described above.     X Prize Foundation     In
2015, we provided a $8,150,000 sponsorship to X Prize Foundation. Larry and Wendy Schmidt, spouse of Eric E. Schmidt, are members of the X Prize Foundation Board of Trustees. Larry, Sergey, Eric, and Wendy are also members of its Vision Circle,
a group of X Prize Foundation s core shareholders and largest contributors. Larry, Sergey, Eric, and Wendy do not have a material interest in the sponsorship described above.  
  Certain Relationships     From time to time, we engage in
certain transactions with other companies affiliated with our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders or their immediate family members. We believe that all such arrangements have been entered into in the ordinary course of
business and have been conducted on an arm s-length basis and do not represent a material interest to such directors, executive officers or significant stockholders.      

Item 14.  
  Principal Accountant Fees and Services.       The following table sets forth all fees paid or accrued
by Alphabet and Google for the audit and other services provided by Ernst   Young LLP during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 (in thousands):      

(1) 
 Audit Fees: This category represents fees for professional services provided in connection with the audit of our financial statements, audit of our internal control over financial reporting, review of our quarterly
financial statements, and audit services provided in connection with other regulatory or statutory filings for which we have engaged Ernst   Young LLP.    

(2) 
 Audit-Related Fees: This category consists primarily of attest services related to information systems.    

(3)

(4) 
 Other Fees: This category consists of fees for services other than the services reported in audit fees, audit-related fees, and tax fees.    
 The Audit Committee considered whether the provision of services other than audit services is compatible with maintaining Ernst   Young
