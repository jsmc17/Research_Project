PART I 

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS 

GENERAL 
    
  Overview and Description of Major Subsidiaries 
    
  AEP was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized in 1925.  It is a public utility holding company that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other subsidiaries. 
    
  The service areas of AEP s public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  Transmission networks are interconnected with extensive distribution facilities in the territories served.  The public utility subsidiaries of AEP have traditionally provided electric service, consisting of generation, transmission and distribution, on an integrated basis to their retail customers. Restructuring laws in Michigan, Ohio and the ERCOT area of Texas have caused AEP public utility subsidiaries in those states to unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers. In Ohio, AEP s regulated utility operates its distribution and transmission assets. 
    
  The member companies of the AEP System have contractual, financial and other business relationships with the other member companies, such as participation in the AEP System savings and retirement plans and tax returns, sales of electricity and transportation and handling of fuel.  The companies of the AEP System also obtain certain accounting, administrative, information systems, engineering, financial, legal, maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider, AEPSC. 
    
  As of December 31,   2017  , the subsidiaries of AEP had a total of 17,666 employees.  Because it is a holding company rather than an operating company, AEP has no employees.  The material subsidiaries of AEP are: 
    
  AEP Texas 
    
  Organized in Delaware in 1925, AEP Texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately   1,030,000   retail customers through REPs in west, central and southern Texas.

FINANCING 
    
  General 
    
  Companies within the AEP System generally use short-term debt to finance working capital needs.  Short-term debt may also be used to finance acquisitions, construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with long-term debt.  In recent history, short-term funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand and AEP s commercial paper program.  Funds are made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate borrowing program.  Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity.  See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the   2017   Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Financial Condition for additional information concerning short-term funding and access to bank lines of credit, commercial paper and capital markets. 
    
  AEP s revolving credit agreement (which backstops the commercial paper program) includes covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility, including a maximum debt/capital test.  In addition, the acceleration of AEP s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements.  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants.  With the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency, any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreement.  A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of AEP or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event.  See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the   2017   Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Financial Condition for additional information with respect to AEP s credit agreement. 
    
  AEP s subsidiaries have also utilized, and expect to continue to utilize, additional financing arrangements, such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements, including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities. 

8 

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS 
    
  General 
    
  AEP subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with regard to air and water-quality control and other environmental matters, and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities.  The environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the AEP System are outlined below. 
    
  Clean Water Act Requirements 
    
  Operations for AEP subsidiaries are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits, and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants.  In 2014, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant s cooling water intake screen (impingement) or entrained in the cooling water.  The standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement.  Compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule.  The standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a site-specific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment.  Challenges to this final rule have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and additional changes could be made to this rule as a result of review by the court. 
    
  In November 2015, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to update the technology-based standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the Clean Water Act s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program.  For additional information, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues. 
    
  Coal Ash Regulation 
    
  AEP s operations produce a number of different coal combustion by-products, including fly ash, bottom ash, gypsum and other materials.  Effective October 2015, the Federal EPA adopted a rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals, including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired electric generating units.  The final rule requires certain standards for location, groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities on a schedule to be implemented by the end of 2018.  If existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards, they will be required to close, but the time frame for closure may be extended if adequate alternative disposal options are not available.  For additional information regarding the Federal EPA action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on operations, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues - Coal Combustion Residual Rule. 
    
  Clean Air Act Requirements 
    
  The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions.  The major CAA programs affecting AEP s power plants are described below.  The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements.    AEP has made significant long-term investments in environmental controls to reduce air emissions from its power plants. Between 2000 and   2017  , AEP invested approximately $8.6 billion in environmental controls, primarily related to the CAA, that have significantly reduced emissions.  From 2001 and including projections through   2018  , AEP expects its emissions of mercury will be lower by approximately 8,300 pounds, a reduction of approximately 87%.  Since 1990 and including projections through   2018  , AEP expects its emissions of SO   2    and NO   x    will be lower by approximately 1,460,000 tons and 560,000 tons, respectively, a reduction of approximately 94% and 89%, respectively. 

9 

The Acid Rain Program 
    
  The 1990 Amendments to the CAA include a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO   2    emissions from power plants.  By 2000, the program established a nationwide cap on power plant SO   2    emissions of 8.9 million tons per year and required further reductions in 2010.  The 1990 Amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce NO   x    emissions through the use of available combustion controls. 
    
  The success of the SO   2    cap-and-trade program encouraged the Federal EPA and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs.  AEP continues to meet its obligations under the Acid Rain Program through the installation of controls, use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets.  Subsequent programs developed by the Federal EPA have imposed more stringent SO   2    and NO   x    emission reduction requirements than the Acid Rain Program on many AEP facilities.  Additional controls and other actions have been taken to achieve compliance with these programs at these facilities. 
    
  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) 
    
  The CAA requires the Federal EPA to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin.  The Federal EPA also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them.  These concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). 
    
  Each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (nonattainment areas).  Each state must develop a state implementation plan (SIP) to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and maintain good air quality in attainment areas.  All SIPs are submitted to the Federal EPA for approval.  If a state fails to develop adequate plans, the Federal EPA develops and implements a plan.  As the Federal EPA reviews the NAAQS and establishes new concentration levels, the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new SIPs.  In 2008, the Federal EPA issued revised NAAQS for both ozone and fine particulate matter (PM   2.5   ).  The PM   2.5    standard was remanded by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and a new rule that lowered the annual standard was signed by the administrator in December 2012.  A new ozone standard was adopted in 2015.  The Federal EPA also adopted a new short-term standard for SO   2    in 2010, a lower standard for NO   x    in 2010, and confirmed the existing standard for lead in 2016.  The existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011.  The states are in the process of developing new SIPs for the SO   2   , PM   2.5    and ozone standards, which could result in more stringent emission limitations being imposed on AEP facilities. 
    
  In 2005, the Federal EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which required additional reductions in SO   2    and NO   x    emissions from power plants and assists states developing new SIPs to meet the NAAQS.   In August 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to replace CAIR (the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)) that contains more stringent requirements to control SO   2    and NO   x    emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in 27 states and the District of Columbia.  Petitions for review were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and CSAPR was vacated.  That decision was subsequently reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court and remanded back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for further proceedings.  The Federal EPA filed a motion to lift the stay and allow Phase I of CSAPR to take effect on January 1, 2015 and Phase II to take effect on January 1, 2017.  The court granted the Federal EPA s motion, and remanded certain state budgets to the Federal EPA for further rulemaking while the rule remains in effect.  The Federal EPA adopted more stringent NO   x    budgets for 23 states during the 2017 ozone season based on the 2008 ozone NAAQS.  For additional information regarding CSAPR, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues - Clean Air Act Requirements. 

10 

Hazardous Air Pollutants 
    
  As a result of the 1990 Amendments to the CAA, the Federal EPA investigated hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to Congress, identifying mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants as warranting further study.  In 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for new and existing coal and oil-fired utility units and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for emissions from new and modified power plants.  Petitions for review of the MACT standards were denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but in 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the Federal EPA acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric generating units.  The Federal EPA has issued a supplemental finding, which has also been challenged in the courts, and the rule remains in effect.  
    
  Regional Haze 
    
  The CAA establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas, including national parks, and requires states to submit SIPs that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas (Regional Haze program).  In 2005, the Federal EPA issued its Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), detailing how the CAA s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power plants. 
    
  PSO executed a settlement with the Federal EPA and the State of Oklahoma to comply with Regional Haze program requirements in Oklahoma, and the settlement is now codified in the Oklahoma SIP.  PSO is in the process of implementing the requirements of the SIP.  The Federal EPA has disapproved portions of the Arkansas and Texas SIPs, and finalized a Federal Implementation Plan for Arkansas in 2016 and a Plan for Texas in 2017.  Challenges to both federal plans are pending in the courts.  For additional information regarding CAVR and the Regional Haze program requirements, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues - Clean Air Act Requirements. 
    
  Climate Change  
    
  AEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO   2    emissions from its generating fleet and expects CO   2    emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coal-fired generation units, and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities.  In February 2018, AEP announced new intermediate and long-term CO   2    emission reduction goals, based on the output of the company s integrated resource plans, which take into account economics, customer demand, regulations, and grid reliability and resiliency, and reflect the company s current business strategy.  The intermediate goal is a 60% reduction from 2000 CO   2    emission levels from AEP generating facilities by 2030; the long-term goal is an 80%  reduction of CO   2    emissions from AEP generating facilities from 2000 levels by 2050.  AEP s total projected CO   2    emissions in   2018   are approximately 90 million metric tons, a 46% reduction from AEP s 2000 CO   2    emissions of approximately 167 million metric tons.  The Federal EPA has taken action to regulate CO   2    emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the CAA.  The Federal EPA published the Clean Power Plan in October 2015.  The Clean Power Plan is being legally challenged by numerous parties and final regulatory outcomes remain uncertain.  In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on the final Clean Power Plan, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans.  The stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court considers any petition for review.      In 2017, the Federal EPA issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan and an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking information that should be considered in the development of new emission guidelines.  For additional information regarding the Federal EPA action taken to regulate CO   2    emissions, including the Clean Power Plan, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Climate Change, CO   2    Regulation and Energy Policy.

Management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as AEP diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units.  The projected decline in coal-fired generation is due to a number of factors, including the ongoing cost of operating older units, the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources, increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals.  Management s strategy for this transformation includes diversifying AEP s fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas, increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources, where there is regulatory support. 
    
  Renewable Sources of Energy 
    
  The states AEP serves, other than Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee, have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency, alternative energy or renewable energy sources. 
    
  At the end of   2017  , the AEP operating companies had long-term contracts for 2,630 MWs of wind and 10 MWs of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies  customers; this includes APCo s 119.7 MW long-term wind contract in Indiana, which began deliveries in January 2018.  In addition, I M owns four solar projects that make up I M s 14.7 MW Clean Energy Solar Pilot Project (CESPP) that was approved by the IURC.  This resulted in a total of 2,655 MWs of wind and solar in-service serving AEP s regulated utilities.  Management actively manages AEP s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction. 
    
  The growth of AEP s renewable portfolio reflects the company s strategy to diversify its generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers.  In addition to gradually reducing AEP s reliance on coal-fueled generating units, the growth of renewables and natural gas helps AEP to maintain a diversity of generation resources.  
    
  The integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by AEP s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect AEP s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers  desire for clean energy in a carbon-constrained world.  AEP has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources.  Transmission assets of the AEP System interconnect approximately 11,900 MWs of renewable energy resources, and AEP s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources. 
    
  AEP Energy Supply, LLC owns   311   MWs of wind capacity in Texas and sells its energy entitlement to third parties or liquidates at market.  In 2017, AEP took several major steps in executing its strategic plan to develop and market a merchant distributed resource portfolio.  AEP Renewables, LLC, was formed in April 2016 to develop and/or acquire large scale renewable projects backed with long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties.  In 2017, AEP Renewables, LLC brought into service a 28 MW solar project in California and owns a 26 MW solar project in Utah and a 62 MW solar project in Nevada that were brought into service in 2016 and 2017, respectively.   
    
  AEP OnSite Partners, LLC works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge, innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities.  The company targets opportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers.  AEP OnSite Partners, LLC pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers.  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP OnSite Partners, LLC owned projects operating in 12 states, including 63 MWs of installed solar capacity, and another 34 MWs of solar projects under construction.

  End Use Energy Efficiency  
    
  Beginning in 2008, AEP ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs.  These programs, commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management, were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available.  Since that time, AEP operating companies implemented programs that have reduced annual consumption by over 7 million MWhs and peak demand by approximately 2,280 MWs.  AEP estimates that its operating companies spent approximately $1.2 billion during that period to achieve these levels.    
    
  Energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states AEP serves, and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for AEP operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings. Appropriate recovery of program costs, lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments.  As AEP continues to transition to a cleaner, more efficient energy future, energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the company serves its customers. 
    
  Corporate Governance 
    
  In response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of AEP s strategic plan, the Board of Directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could accelerate the retirement of coal-fired generation assets.  The Board of Directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would affect the company.  The Board s Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance oversees the company s annual Corporate Accountability Report, which includes information about the company s environmental, financial and social performance. In addition, as a result of ongoing corporate governance outreach efforts with shareholders, AEP set new carbon dioxide emission reduction goals that were published in a new report in February 2018,  American Electric Power: Strategic Vision for a Clean Energy Future.   
    
  Other Environmental Issues and Matters 
    
  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites, as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites.  See Note   6   to the financial statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, included in the   2017   Annual Reports, under the heading entitled The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation for further information. 
    
  Environmental Investments 
    
  Investments related to improving AEP System plants  environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during   2015  ,   2016   and   2017   and the current estimate for   2018   are shown below.  These investments include both environmental as well as other related spending.  Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental  
  
   13 

regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends and the ability to access capital.  In addition to the amounts set forth below, AEP expects to make substantial investments in future years in connection with the modification and addition at generation plants  facilities for environmental quality controls.  Such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2017 or have been proposed and may be adopted.  Future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous.  The cost of complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the AEP System.  AEP typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions.  For AEP s merchant generation units however, there is no such recovery mechanism.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP s financial condition.  See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading entitled Environmental Issues and Note   6   to the financial statements, entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, included in the   2017   Annual Reports, for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general. 

(a) 
    Includes expenditures of the subsidiaries shown and other subsidiaries not shown. The figures reflect construction expenditures, not investments in subsidiary companies. 
              (b) 
    Estimated amounts are exclusive of debt AFUDC. 
       
  Management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with air and water quality standards and other impacts of the environmental proposals.  The following cost estimates for periods following   2018   will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in the final rules.  These cost estimates will also change based on: (a) the states  implementation of these regulatory programs, including the potential for state implementation plans (SIPs) or federal implementation plans (FIPs) that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired, replaced or sold, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and (g) other factors.   
    
  Management s current ranges of estimates of new major environmental investments excluding unregulated assets beginning in   2018  , exclusive of debt AFUDC, are set forth below:

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
    
  AEP s Reportable Segments 
    
  AEP s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.  Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight.  Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. 
    
  AEP s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below: 
    
  Vertically Integrated Utilities 

Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. 
       
  Transmission and Distribution Utilities 

Transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by OPCo and AEP Texas.  
                
    OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve Standard Service Offer customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load. 
       
  AEP Transmission Holdco 

Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEPTCo.  These investments have FERC-approved returns on equity. 
                
    Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEP s transmission-only joint ventures. These investments have PUCT-approved or FERC-approved returns on equity. 
       
  Generation   Marketing 

Competitive generation in ERCOT and PJM. 
                
    Marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO. 
                
    Contracted renewable energy investments and management services. 
       
  The remainder of AEP s activities is presented as Corporate and Other.  While not considered a reportable segment, Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries, Parent s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income and interest expense and other nonallocated costs.  With the sale of AEP River Operations, LLC (AEPRO), a commercial barge operation, in November 2015, the activities related to the AEPRO segment have been moved to Corporate and Other for the periods presented.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 

15 

VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES 
    
  GENERAL 
    
  AEP s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.  AEPSC, as agent for AEP s public utility subsidiaries, performs marketing, generation dispatch, fuel procurement and power-related risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries. 
    
  ELECTRIC GENERATION 
    
  Facilities 
    
  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 23,000 MWs of domestic generation.  See Item 2   Properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries. 
    
  Fuel Supply 
    
  The following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type (including wind purchase agreements), on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Vertically Integrated Utilities: 

A price increase/decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels, as well as the addition of renewable resources, may result in the decreased/increased use of other fuels.  AEP s overall   2017   fossil fuel costs for the Vertically Integrated Utilities remained flat on a dollar per MMBtu basis from   2016  . 
    
  Coal and Lignite 
    
  AEP s Vertically Integrated Utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term contracts, affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms.  Coal consumption in   2017   decreased from   2016   due to additional planned outages. 
    
  Management believes that the Vertically Integrated Utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignite-fired units.  Through subsidiaries, AEP owns, leases or controls more than 3,675 railcars, 468 barges, 11 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in AEP generating facilities. 
    
  Spot market prices for coal started to strengthen in the second half of   2017  .  The increased spot coal prices reflect tighter supplies and increased demand for export coal.  As of December 31,   2017  , approximately half of the coal purchased by AEP s subsidiaries was procured through term contracts.  As those contracts expire or re-open for price adjustments, needed tonnage is replaced at current market prices as necessary.  The price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods.  The price paid for coal delivered in   2017   decreased approximately 4% from   2016  . 

16 

The following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities: 

The coal supplies at the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries.  As of December 31,   2017  , the Vertically Integrated Utilities  coal inventory was approximately 37 days of full load burn.  While inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary, the current coal inventory target for the Vertically Integrated Utilities is approximately 30 days. 
    
  Natural Gas 
    
  The Vertically Integrated Utilities consumed approximately 86 billion cubic feet of natural gas during   2017   for generating power. This represents a decrease of 17% from   2016  .  Total gas consumption for the Vertically Integrated Utilities was lower year over year primarily because higher natural gas prices in   2017   caused natural gas plants to be used less (and for coal plants to be used more).  Several of AEP s natural gas-fired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability. A portfolio of term, monthly, seasonal and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant, as appropriate.  AEP s natural gas supply agreements are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices. 
    
  The following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities  plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities. 

Nuclear 
    
  I M has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the Cook Plant.  I M has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot, short-term and mid-term markets.  I M also continues to finance its nuclear fuel through leasing. 
    
  For purposes of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel, I M completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago.  I M entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue.  I M is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis.  I M completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in 2012, which consisted of 12 casks (32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each).  The second loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry casks was completed in 2015, which consisted of 16 casks.  The third dry cask loading campaign, which is forecasted to also load 16 casks, is expected to begin in the summer of 2018. 

17 

Nuclear Waste and Decommissioning 
    
  As the owner of the Cook Plant, I M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely.  The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program.  The most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2015.  The estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste for the Cook Plant was $1.6 billion in 2015 non-discounted dollars, with additional ongoing estimated costs of $5 million per year for post decommissioning storage of spent nuclear fuel and an eventual estimated cost of $57 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility, also in 2015 nondiscounted dollars.  As of December 31,   2017  , the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the Cook Plant was approximately $2.2 billion. The balance of funds available to eventually decommission Cook Plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns.  The ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the: 

Escalation of various cost elements (including, but not limited to, general inflation and the cost of energy). 
                
    Further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning. 
                
    Technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies. 
                
    Availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities. 
                
    Availability of a United States Department of Energy facility for permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel. 
       
  Accordingly, management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the Cook Plant will not be significantly different than current projections.  AEP will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections.  See Note   6   to the financial statements, entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies under the heading Nuclear Contingencies, included in the   2017   Annual Reports, for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning. 
    
  Low-Level Radioactive Waste 
    
  The Low-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste rests with the individual states.  Low-level radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials.  Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available.  I M cannot predict when such a site may be available. However, the states of Utah and Texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from Michigan waste generators.  There is currently no set date limiting I M s access to either of these facilities.  The Cook Plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste.  In the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable, it can be stored onsite at this facility. 
    
  Counterparty Risk Management 
    
  The Vertically Integrated Utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants.  As a result, counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions.  As of December 31,   2017  , counterparties posted approximately $9 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEPSC for the benefit of AEP s public utility subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately     $60 million with counterparties and exchanges).  Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily.  See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the   2017   Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information. 

18 

Certain Power Agreements 
    
  I M  
    
  The Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I M, dated March 31, 1982, provides for the sale by AEGCo to I M of all the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant.  Whether or not power is available from AEGCo, I M is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by I M).  The agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of Unit 2 of the Rockport Plant have expired (currently December 2022) unless extended in specified circumstances. 
    
  Pursuant to an assignment between I M and KPCo, and a unit power agreement between AEGCo and KPCo, AEGCo sells KPCo 30% of the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant.  KPCo has agreed to pay to AEGCo the amounts that I M would have paid AEGCo under the terms of the Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I M for such entitlement.  The KPCo unit power agreement expires in December 2022. 
    
  OVEC 
    
  AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC.  The aggregate equity participation of AEP in OVEC is 43.47%.  Parent owns 39.17% and OPCo owns 4.3%.  Under the Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA), which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each, the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I M and OPCo is 43.47%.  The ICPA terminates in June 2040.  The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital.  AEP and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests.  OVEC financed capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion in connection with flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances, including tax-advantaged debt issuances.  Both OVEC generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls in service.  OPCo attempted to assign its rights and obligations under the ICPA to an affiliate as part of its transfer of its generation assets and liabilities in keeping with corporate separation required by Ohio law.  OPCo failed to obtain the consent to assignment from the other owners of OVEC and therefore filed a request with the PUCO seeking authorization to maintain its ownership of OVEC. In December 2013, the PUCO approved OPCo s request, subject to the condition that energy from the OVEC entitlements are sold into the day-ahead or real-time PJM energy markets, or on a forward basis through a bilateral arrangemen  t.  In November 2016, the PUCO approved OPCo s request to approve a cost-based pur  chased power agreement (PPA) rider, effective in January 2017, that would initially be based upon OPCo s contractual entitlement under the ICPA which is approximately 20% of OVEC s capacity.  Some parties filed a rehearing challenge to the PUCO decision, which was denied.  Those parties filed an appeal before the Supreme Court of Ohio to challenge the PUCO s decision, which remains pending. In late 2016, two nonaffiliated parties to the ICPA owned by First Energy Corp. ( FE ) announced its intention to exit its merchant business and that it may pursue restructuring or bankruptcy.  FE s aggregate power participation ratio is approximately 8% under the ICPA.  Presently, FE has yet to pursue restructuring or bankruptcy.  However, as a result of this announcement and other related developments, Moody s downgraded OVEC s rating with a negative outlook for possible downgrade, while Fitch and S P have revised OVEC s outlook to negative.  

19 

ELECTRIC DELIVERY 
    
  General 
    
  Other than AEGCo, AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power.  See Item 2   Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines.  Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC.  See Item 1. Business   Vertically Integrated Utilities   Regulation   Rates.  The FERC regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts.  The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, principles, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and SPP, and as approved by the FERC.  See Item 1. Business   Vertically Integrated Utilities   Regulation   FERC.  As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to non-affiliated companies. 
    
  Other than AEGCo, AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.  In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory.  These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.  In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.  For a discussion of competition in the sale of power, see Item 1. Business   Vertically Integrated Utilities   Competition. 
    
  Transmission Agreement  (TA) 
    
  APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT and are parties to the TA.  OPCo, a subsidiary in AEP s Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment, is also a party to the TA.  The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM.  The TA has been approved by the FERC. 
    
  TCA, OATT, and ERCOT Protocols  
    
  PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA.  Under the TCA, a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of (a) overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement, including the performance of transmission planning studies, (b) the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and (c) compliance with the terms of the OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such tariff.  Pursuant to the TCA, AEPSC has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on behalf of the other parties to the agreement.  The TCA also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the OATT.  These allocations have been determined by the FERC-approved OATT for the SPP. 
    
  Regional Transmission Organizations 
    
  AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM, and PSO and SWEPCo are members of the SPP (both FERC-approved RTOs).  RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not.

REGULATION 
    
  General 
    
  AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries  retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional cost-based regulation by the state utility commissions.  AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions.  I M is subject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to the operation of the Cook Plant.  AEP and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of EPACT, much of which is administered by the FERC. 
    
  Rates 
    
  Historically, state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service.  A utility s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.  State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (a) a utility s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility s level of investment.  Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative.  Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers.  Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time. 
    
  Public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service.  Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment, it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery.  Given long lead times in construction, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets, management actively pursues strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow.  AEP representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process.  These options include pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates. 
    
  The rates of AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service).  Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility s rates and tariffs.  Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes. 
    
  The following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate.  Several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction.  See Note   4   to the financial statements, entitled Rate Matters, included in the   2017   Annual Reports, for more information regarding pending rate matters. 
    
  Indiana 
    
  I M provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the IURC, with rates set on a cost-of-service basis.  Indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism. 

21 

Oklahoma 
    
  PSO provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the OCC.  PSO s rates are set on a cost-of-service basis.  Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatt-hour sales. 
    
  Virginia 
    
  APCo currently provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates, currently frozen, approved by the Virginia SCC.  Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause.  In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including transmission services provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC. 
    
  West Virginia 
    
  APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-service basis.  West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which trues-up to actual expenses. 
    
  FERC 
    
  Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale, transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects.  The FERC regulations require AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and AEP has approved cost-based formula transmission rates on file at the FERC.  The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers.  In addition, the FERC regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by (a) approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and (b) granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at market-based rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices.  AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have market-based rate authority from the FERC, under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place.  The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, to file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility s own uses of its transmission system.  The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities  transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility s marketing employees.  Additionally, the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, with the approval of the FERC. 
    
  The FERC oversees RTOs, entities created to operate, plan and control utility transmission assets.  FERC Order 2000 prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable RTO proposals.  AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM.  PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP. 
    
  The FERC has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of AEP s public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition of securities of utilities, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company.  In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system. 

22 

COMPETITION 
    
  Other than AEGCo, AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries generate, transmit and distribute electricity to retail customers of AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC, and are not subject to competition from other vertically integrated public utilities.  Other than AEGCo, AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights that effectively grant the exclusive ability to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.   
    
  AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries compete with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.  The primary factors in such competition are price, reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power.  With respect to competing generators and self-generation, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they currently maintain a competitive position.  
    
  Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP s competitiveness.   
    
  SEASONALITY 
    
  The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEP s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP s results of operations.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP s results of operations. 

23 

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES 
    
  GENERAL 
    
  This segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo.  OPCo is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately   1,477,000   retail customers in Ohio.  OPCo purchases energy and capacity at auction to serve generation service customers who have not switched to a competitive generation supplier.  AEP Texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately   1,030,000   retail customers through REPs in west, central and southern Texas. 
    
  AEP s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power.  See Item 2   Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines.  Transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are made at rates approved by the PUCT for AEP Texas and by the PUCO and the FERC for OPCo.  The FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions.  As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to non-affiliated companies. 
    
  AEP s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.  In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service.  These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.  In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business. 
    
  The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and ERCOT, and as approved by the FERC.  In addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas, AEP s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries through RTOs also provide transmission services for non-affiliated companies. 
    
  Transmission Agreement  (TA) 
    
  OPCo owns and operates transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT; OPCo is a party to the TA with other utility subsidiary affiliates.  The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM.  The TA has been approved by the FERC. 
    
  Regional Transmission Organizations  
    
  OPCo is a member of PJM, a FERC-approved RTO.  RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not.  AEP Texas is a member of ERCOT. 

24 

REGULATION 
    
  OPCo provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at cost-based rates approved by the PUCO or by the FERC.  AEP Texas provides transmission and distribution service on a cost-of-service basis at rates approved by the PUCT and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the FERC consistent with PUCT rules.  Transmission and distribution rates are established on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service.  The cost of service generally reflects operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.  Utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (a) a utility s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility s level of investment. 
    
  FERC 
    
  Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC regulates rates for transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters.  The FERC regulations require AEP to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and it has approved cost-based formula transmission rates on file at the FERC.  The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers.  The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility s own uses of its transmission system.  The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities  transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility s marketing employees. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.  Additionally, the transition and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, with the approval of the FERC. 
    
  SEASONALITY 
    
  The delivery of electric power is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEP s transmission and distribution facilities.  In addition, AEP transmission and distribution has historically delivered less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  In Texas, and to a lesser extent, in Ohio, where we have residential decoupling, unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP s results of operations.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP s results of operations.

AEP TRANSMISSION HOLDCO (AEPTHCO) 
    
  GENERAL 
    
  AEPTHCo is a holding company for (a) AEPTCo, which is the direct holding company for the State Transcos and (b) AEP s Transmission Joint Ventures. 
    
  AEPTCo 
    
  AEPTCo wholly owns the State Transcos: 

AEP Appalachian Transmission Company, Inc. (APTCo) 
                
    AEP Indiana Michigan Transmission Company, Inc. (IMTCo) 
                
    AEP Kentucky Transmission Company, Inc. (KTCo) 
                
    AEP Ohio Transmission Company, Inc. (OHTCo) 
                
    AEP West Virginia Transmission Company, Inc. (WVTCo) 
                
    AEP Oklahoma Transmission Company, Inc. (OKTCo) 
                
    AEP Southwestern Transmission Company, Inc. (SWTCo) 
       
  The State Transcos are independent of, but respectively overlay, the following AEP electric utility operating companies: APCo, I M, KPCo, KGPCo, OPCo, PSO, SWEPCo, and WPCo.  The State Transcos develop, own, operate, and maintain their respective transmission assets.  Assets of the State Transcos interconnect to transmission facilities owned by the aforementioned operating companies and unaffiliated transmission owners within the footprints of PJM and SPP.  APTCo, IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, and WVTCo are located within PJM.  OKTCo and SWTCo are located within SPP. 
    
  IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, OKTCo, and WVTCo have received all necessary approvals for formation and currently own and operate transmission assets in their respective jurisdictions.  In December 2016, the Virginia SCC and WVPSC granted consent for APCo and APTCo to enter into a joint license agreement that will support APTCo investment in the state of Tennessee.  An application for regulatory approval for SWTCo is under consideration in Louisiana. 
    
  The State Transcos are regulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by the FERC and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems.  The State Transcos establish transmission rates each year through formula rate filings with the FERC.  The rate filings calculate the revenue requirement needed to cover the costs of operation and debt service and to earn an allowed return on equity.  These rates are then included in an OATT for SPP and PJM. 
    
  The State Transcos own, operate, maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability, grid security, safety, reduce transmission constraints and facilitate interconnections of new generating resources and new wholesale customers, as well as enhance competitive wholesale electricity markets.  A key part of AEP s business is replacing and upgrading transmission facilities, assets and components of the existing AEP System as needed to maintain reliability. 
    
  The State Transcos provide the capability to replace and upgrade existing facilities.  As of December 31,   2017  , the State Transcos had $5.5 billion of transmission assets in-service with plans to construct approximately $4.3 billion of additional transmission assets through 2020.  Additional investment in transmission infrastructure is needed within PJM and SPP to maintain the required level of grid reliability, resiliency, security and efficiency and to address an aging transmission infrastructure.  Additional transmission facilities will be needed based on changes in generating resources, such as wind or solar projects, generation additions or retirements, and additional new customer interconnections.  AEP will continue its investment to enhance physical and cyber security of assets, and are also investing in improving the telecommunication network that supports the operation and control of the grid.  
  
   26 

AEPTHCO JOINT VENTURE INITIATIVES 
    
  AEP has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing, building, and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in North America (Transmission Joint Ventures).  
    
  The Transmission Joint Ventures currently include: 

(a) 
    ETT is undertaking multiple projects and the completion dates will vary for those projects.  ETT s investment in completed, current and future projects in ERCOT over the next ten years is expected to be $3.3 billion.  Future projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
              (b) 
    AEP owns 25% of Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC (Prairie Wind) through its ownership interest in Electric Transmission America, LLC. which is a 50/50 joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly known as MidAmerican Energy) and AEP. 
              (c) 
    The Pioneer project consists of approximately 286 miles of new 765 kV transmission lines, which is estimated to cost $1.1 billion at completion.  Pioneer is developing the first 66-mile segment jointly with Northern Indiana Public Service Company at a total estimated cost of $347 million.  The projected completion date for the first 66-mile segment is June 2018.  The projected completion dates for the remaining segments have not been determined. 
              (d) 
    AEP owns 87.5% of RITELine Indiana, LLC (RITELine IN) through its ownership interest in RITELine Transmission Development, LLC (RTD) and AEPTHCo.  AEP owns 12.5% of RITELine Illinois, LLC (RITELine IL) through its ownership interest in RTD.  RTD is a 50/50 joint venture with Exelon Transmission Company, LLC and AEPTHCo. 
              (e) 
    RITELine IN is a consolidated variable interest entity.  RTD received an order from the FERC in October 2011 granting incentives for the RITELine IN and RITELine IL projects.  The projects and other segments that are electrically equivalent in nature will continue to be submitted for consideration in the interregional planning process between PJM and MISO as dictated by emerging system needs. 
              (f) 
    AEP owns 86.5% of Transource Missouri, Transource West Virginia, Transource Maryland and Transource Pennsylvania through its ownership interest in Transource Energy, LLC (Transource).  Transource is a joint venture with AEPTHCo and Great Plains Energy formed to pursue competitive transmission projects.  AEPTHCo and Great Plains Energy own 86.5% and 13.5% of Transource, respectively. 
              (g) 
    The ROE represents the weighted average approved return on equity based on the costs of two projects developed by Transource Missouri; the $65 million Iatan-Nashua project (10.3%) and the $246 million Sibley-Nebraska City project (11.3%). 
              (h) 
    In August 2016, Transource Maryland and Transource Pennsylvania received approval from the PJM Interconnection Board to construct portions of a transmission project located in both Maryland and Pennsylvania.  The project is expected to go in service in 2020.  
              (i) 
    In January 2018, Transource Maryland and Transource Pennsylvania received FERC approval of a settlement authorizing an ROE of 10.4%.  This reflects a 9.9% base plus 0.5% RTO participation adder. 
              (j) 
    RITELine IN, Transource Missouri, Transource West Virginia, Transource Maryland and Transource Pennsylvania are consolidated joint ventures by AEP.  Therefore, the investment value listed reflects applicable income taxes that are the responsibility of AEP.  All other investments in this table are joint ventures that are not consolidated by AEP.  Therefore, these investment values listed do not reflect income taxes that are the responsibility of AEP. 
     
   27 

AEP s joint ventures do not have employees.  Business services for the joint ventures are provided by AEPSC and other AEP subsidiaries and the joint venture partners.  During   2017  , approximately 510 AEPSC employees and 283 operating company employees provided service to one or more joint ventures. 
    
  REGULATION 
    
  The State Transcos and the Transmission Joint Ventures located outside of ERCOT establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the FERC pursuant to FERC-approved implementation protocols.  The protocols include a transparent, formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated. 
    
  The State Transcos  and the Transmission Joint Ventures  (where applicable) rates are included in the respective OATT for PJM and SPP.  An OATT is the FERC rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider s transmission system.  The FERC requires transmission providers such as PJM and SPP to offer transmission service to all eligible customers (for example, load-serving entities, power marketers, generators and customers) on a non-discriminatory basis. 
    
  The FERC-approved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with the FERC.  The formula rates establish rates for a one-year period based on the current projects in-service and proposed projects for a defined timeframe.  The formula rates also include a true-up calculation for the previous year s billings, allowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owner s ATRR.  PJM and SPP pay the transmission owners their ATRR for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the PJM and SPP OATTs, based on the terms and conditions in the respective OATT for the service taken.  Additionally, the State Transcos are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, with the approval of the FERC. 
    
  The formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of 11.49% based on a capital structure of up to 50% equity for APTCo, IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo and WVTCo (the East Transcos).  OKTCo and SWTCo (the West Transcos) are allowed a return on equity of 11.2% based on a capital structure of up to 50% equity. The authorized returns on equity for the State Transcos are commensurate with the FERC-authorized returns on equity in the PJM and SPP OATTs, respectively, for AEP s utility subsidiaries.  These returns have been challenged by parties in filings before the FERC. 
    
  In the annual rate base filings described above, the State Transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of $3.8 billion for   2017  , $3.2 billion for   2016   and $2.3 billion for   2015  .  The total transmission revenue requirements filed in the ATRR, including prior year over/under-recovery of revenue and associated carrying charges, for   2017  ,   2016  , and   2015   was $690 million, $555 million and $363 million, respectively. 
    
  The rates of ETT, which is located in ERCOT, are determined by the PUCT.  ETT sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim Transmission Costs of Services (TCOS) filings.  ETT may file interim TCOS filings semi-annually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital.  
    
  Effective March 2017, the Transmission Joint Ventures have approved returns on equity ranging from 9.6% to 12.8% based on equity capital structures ranging from 40% to 60%. 
  
   28 

GENERATION   MARKETING 
    
  GENERAL 
    
  The AEP Generation   Marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive generating assets, a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business.  The largest subsidiary in the Generation   Marketing segment is AGR.  In January 2017, AGR sold 4,143 MWs of generation capacity to an unaffiliated third party and terminated a 1,186 MW unit power agreement.  As of December 31, 2017, AGR owns   2,564   MWs of generating capacity.  Other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets.  See Item 2   Properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the Generation   Marketing segment.  AGR is a competitive generation subsidiary. 
    
  With respect to the wholesale energy trading and marketing business, AEP Generation   Marketing segment subsidiaries enter into short-term and long-term transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in ERCOT, SPP, MISO and PJM.  These subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power, natural gas and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities.   
    
  These activities primarily involve the purchase-and-sale of electricity (and to a lesser extent, natural gas and emissions allowances) under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices.  These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, over-the-counter swaps and options.  The majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts.  These transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges. 
    
  With respect to the retail supply and energy management business, AEP Energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity and/or natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers.  AEP Energy provides various  energy solutions in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington, D.C.  AEP Energy also provides demand-side management solutions nationwide.  AEP Energy had approximately 410,000 customer accounts as of December 31,   2017  . 
    
  As of December 31, 2017, AEP Energy Supply LLC owns   311   MWs of wind capacity in Texas and sells its energy entitlement to third parties or liquidates at market.  During January 2018, a repowering agreement was entered into with a non-affiliated party that contributed full turbine sets in exchange for a 20% ownership interest.  AEP Energy Supply, LLC retained 80% ownership (248 MW) of the wind capacity.  AEP Renewables, LLC develops and/or acquires large scale renewable projects backed with long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties.  In 2017, AEP Renewables, LLC brought into service a 28 MW solar project in California and a 62 MW solar project in Nevada.  The company also owns a 26 MW solar project in Utah that was brought into service in 2016.

  REGULATION 
    
  AGR is a public utility under the Federal Power Act, and is subject to the FERC s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable.  The FERC granted AGR market-based rate authority in December 2013.  The FERC s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of AGR  
  
   29 

and set cost-based rates if the FERC subsequently determines that it can exercise market power, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.  Periodically, AGR is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet the FERC s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for market-based rates.  Other matters subject to the FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, review of mergers, and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility. 
    
  Specific operations of AGR are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal, state, regional and local agencies, including federal and state environmental protection agencies.  AGR is also regulated by the PUCT for transactions inside ERCOT.  Additionally, AGR is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, with the approval of the FERC.  
    
  COMPETITION 
    
  The AEP Generation   Marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power, capacity and ancillary services.  The principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation. Because most of AGR s remaining generation is coal-fired, lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation.  Other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation, transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities, inoperability or inefficiencies, outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities. 
    
  Technology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEP s Generation   Marketing segment.  AGR also competes with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.  The primary factors in such competition are price, unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power.  
    
  Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AGR s competitiveness.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive. 
    
  In the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.  These events could cause AGR to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life. 
    
  This segment s retail operations provide competitive electricity and natural gas in deregulated retail energy markets in six states and Washington, D.C. Each such retail choice jurisdiction establishes its own laws and regulations governing its competitive market, and public utility commission communications and utility default service pricing can affect customer participation in retail competition. Sustained low natural gas and power prices, low market volatility and maturing competitive environments can adversely affect this business. 
    
  This segment also engages in procuring and selling output from renewable generation sources under long-term contracts to creditworthy counterparties.  New sources are not acquired without first securing a long-term placement of such power.  Existing sources do not face competitive exposure.  Competitive unaffiliated suppliers of renewable or other generation could limit opportunities for future transactions for new sources and related output contracts.   

30 

SEASONALITY 
    
  The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change. 
    
  Fuel Supply 
    
  The following table shows the generation sources by type, on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Generation   Marketing segment, not including AEP Energy Partners  offtake agreement from the Oklaunion generating unit: 

In January 2017, AEP sold three natural gas plants, Darby, Lawrenceburg and Waterford, to a nonaffiliated party. The sale resulted in a decrease in AEP s natural gas supply in 2017, which increased AEP s coal supply as a percentage of total fuel supply in 2017.  
    
  Coal and Consumables 
    
  AGR procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms.  As contracts expire, they are replaced, as needed, with contracts at market prices. Coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements. 
  Management believes that AGR will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal fired units.  AGR, through its contracts with third party transporters, has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facilities.  AGR plants consumed 4.6 million tons of coal in   2017  . 
    
  The coal supplies at AGR plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, coal quality, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries.  AGR aims to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plants in the range of 15 to 40 days of full load burn.  As of December 31,   2017  , the coal inventory of AGR was above target. 
    
  Counterparty Risk Management 
    
  Counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions.  As of December 31,   2017  , counterparties posted approximately $20 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEP for the benefit of AEP s Generation   Marketing segment subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP s Generation   Marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately     $97 million with counterparties and exchanges).  Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily.  See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the   2017   Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information. 
    
  Certain Power Agreements 
    
  As of December 31,   2017  , the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 311 MWs of company-owned domestic wind power facilities, 177 MWs of domestic wind power from long-term purchase power agreements and 355 MWs of coal-fired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers the interest of AEP Texas in the Oklaunion Power Station to AEP Energy Partners, Inc.  The power obtained from the Oklaunion Power Station is marketed and sold in ERCOT.

ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS 
    
  GENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONS 
    
  AEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  AEP s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments.  This would cause financial results to be diminished. 
    
  Regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  In certain instances, AEP s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval.  AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates. 
    
  If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings.  Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.  For additional information, see Note   4     Rate Matters and Note   12     Income Taxes, of the notes to the financial statements, included in the 2017 Annual Reports.   
    
  AEP s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Management expects that a growing portion of AEP s earnings in the future will be derived from transmission investments and activities.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If the FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.   
    
  Certain elements of AEP s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas) 
    
  AEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC. The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates. All aspects of AEP s rates accepted or approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the actual equity portion  
  
   33 

of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative. In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate true up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEP s formula rate implementation protocols. If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC will make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of AEP s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula. 
    
  In October 2016, several parties filed a complaint with the FERC claiming that the base ROE used by certain AEP subsidiaries that operate in PJM, including the East Transcos, in calculating formula transmission rates under the PJM OATT, is excessive and should be reduced from 10.99% to 8.32%, effective upon the date of the complaint. In June 2017, a similar complaint was filed with the FERC claiming that the base ROE used by certain AEP subsidiaries that operate in SPP, including the West Transcos, in calculating formula transmission rates under the SPP OATT is excessive and should be reduced from 10.7% to 8.36%, effective upon the date of the complaint. If the FERC orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint, including refunds from the date of the complaint filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially. 
    
  Recent changes in federal income tax policy may adversely affect cash flows, as well as credit ratings. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Recently enacted United States federal income tax legislation significantly changed the Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. The legislation is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state income tax authorities, and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, the regulatory treatment of the impacts of this legislation will be subject to the discretion of the FERC and state public utility commissions. 
    
  Although it is unclear when or how capital markets, credit rating agencies, the FERC or state public utility commissions may respond to this legislation, Management expects that certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies, such as funds from operations-to-debt percentage, could be negatively impacted.  In addition, state public utility commissions have started to engage with AEP s utility subsidiaries to determine how any tax savings will be returned to customers. Management expects that AEP s utility subsidiaries will return the tax benefits to customers, either through decreasing rates, increasing the amortization of regulatory assets, accelerating depreciation or offsetting other rate increases. The amount and the timing of any payments of tax benefits to be returned to customers will ultimately be determined by the regulators. 
    
  Management s analysis and interpretation of this legislation is preliminary and ongoing.  Based on Management s current evaluation, limitations on interest deductions are not expected to be significant. Any amendments to the legislation or interpretations or implementing regulations by the IRS contrary to Management s interpretation of the legislation could limit the ability to deduct the interest on some of the Registrants  outstanding debt. 
    
  There may be other material adverse effects resulting from the legislation that have not yet been identified. If Management is unable to successfully take actions to manage any adverse impacts of the new tax legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments or technical corrections exacerbate the adverse impacts of the legislation, the legislation could have an adverse effect on the Registrants  financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and on the value of investments in debt securities and common stock. Any negative actions by credit rating agencies may make it more costly to issue future debt securities and could increase borrowing costs under existing credit facilities.  For additional information, see Note 4 - Rate Matters and Note 12 - Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  
   34 

Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.   Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP s competitiveness.   Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. 
     
  AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled. 
    
  AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  I M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of   2,278   MWs, or about 7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  AEP and I M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following: 

The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel. 
                
    Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations. 
                
    Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others). 
                
    Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. 
                
    Uncertainties related to AEP s reliance on a vendor for manufacturing nuclear fuel and for providing specialized engineering services and parts. 
       
  There can be no assurance that I M s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered. 

35 

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I M to make material contributory payments. 
    
  Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured. 
    
  Westinghouse and I M have a number of significant ongoing contracts relating to reactor services, nuclear fuel fabrication, and ongoing engineering projects. The most significant of these relate to Cook Plant fuel fabrication. In March 2017, Westinghouse filed a petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. It intends to reorganize, not cease business operations. However, at the current stage of the bankruptcy process, it is unclear whether the company can successfully reorganize.  In January 2018, Westinghouse issued a news release stating that it intends to sell all of its global business, including the portion of the nuclear business that contracts with Cook Plant.  Any sale would require approval by the bankruptcy court.  In the unlikely event Westinghouse rejects I M s contracts, or there is an interference with the sale process, Cook Plant s operations would be significantly impacted and potentially shut down temporarily as I M seeks other vendors for these services. 
    
  The different regional power markets in which AEP subsidiaries compete have changing market and transmission structures, which could affect performance in these regions. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various regional power markets, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.  Because the manner in which RTOs will evolve remains unclear, management is unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on the business. 
    
  AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates. 

36 

A substantial portion of AEP s receivables is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect AEP s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas) 
    
  AEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers. As of December 31, 2017, AEP Texas did business with approximately 124 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments. AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. The PUCT enhanced the financial qualifications required of REPs that began selling power after January 1, 2009 and authorized utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in a future rate case. In 2017, AEP Texas  largest REP accounted for 18% of its operating revenue and its second largest REP accounted for 17% of its operating revenue. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP. 
    
  Actual capital investment in the State Transco s may be lower than planned, which would cause a lower than anticipated rate base and would therefore result in lower revenues and earnings compared to management s current expectations. (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo) 
    
  Each of the State Transcos  rate base, revenues and earnings are determined in part by additions to property, plant and equipment and when those additions are placed in service. AEPTCo anticipates making significant capital investments over the next several years; however, the amounts could change significantly due to factors beyond its control. If the State Transcos  capital investment and the resulting in-service property, plant and equipment are lower than anticipated for any reason, the State Transcos will have a lower than anticipated rate base, thus causing their revenue requirements and future earnings to be lower than anticipated. 
    
  Changes in energy laws, regulations or policies could impact AEP s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Each of the Registrant Subsidiaries is regulated by either the FERC as a  public utility  under federal law or the PUCT and is a transmission owner in ERCOT, PJM or SPP. AEP cannot predict whether the approved rate methodologies for any of the Registrant Subsidiaries will be changed. In addition, the U.S. Congress periodically considers enacting energy legislation that could assign new responsibilities to the FERC, modify existing law or provide the FERC or another entity with increased authority to regulate transmission matters. AEP cannot predict whether, and to what extent, the Registrant Subsidiaries may be affected by any such changes in federal energy laws, regulations or policies in the future. While the Registrant Subsidiaries are subject to the PUCT s or FERC s exclusive jurisdiction for purposes of rate regulation, changes in state laws affecting other matters, such as transmission siting and construction, could limit investment opportunities. 

37 

RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKS 
    
  AEP s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including: 

Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. 
                
    Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements. 
                
    Labor disputes. 
                
    Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards. 
                
    Information technology failure that impairs AEP s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations. 
                
    Information technology failure that affects AEP s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims. 
                
    Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors. 
                
    Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences. 
                
    Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry. 
       
  Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential     information and damage AEP s reputation.     (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.  Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber attack.  In addition, the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. 
    
  A security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses  physical assets or information systems, interconnected entities in RTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject AEP and its regulated utility businesses to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data.  A successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues.  The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.  A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP s reputation.  In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 

38 

In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, AEP has a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems.  In addition, AEP is subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements.  However, cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt, and, as a result, there is a risk that AEP could experience a successful cyber attack despite current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts. 
    
  If AEP is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP s ability to raise capital and fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  Certain sources of debt and equity capital expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  If sources of capital for AEP are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
  Downgrades in AEP s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and  cash flows.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.  AEP s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  If AEP s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
  AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from its subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP) 
    
  AEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.  Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.  Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness. 
    
  AEP s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable. 
    
  Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 

39 

Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning.  (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning) 
    
  The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of AEP s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.  Additionally, I M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant.  The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts. 
    
  Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced. 
    
  Changes in the price of commodities, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP s cost of producing power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo) 
    
  AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel (including coal and gas) and the price and availability to transport fuel.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of coal used as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  As long as current environmental programs remain in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  If the Federal EPA attempts to further reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  AEP s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge. 
    
  Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of fuel, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
  In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked to market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition. 

40 

AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events.  Customers  energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers  energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes. 
    
  Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers. 
    
  Severe weather impacts AEP s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase AEP s cost of providing service.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks. 
    
  To the extent climate change impacts a region s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System. 
    
  Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note   6   of the Notes to Financial Statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
  Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas) 
    
  AEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. 

41 

Hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks. The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. AEP maintains property and casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEP s business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages. 
    
  Management is considering strategic alternatives for a portion of interest in the Oklaunion Power Station and may incur losses as a result.  (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas and PSO) 
    
  Management is evaluating strategic alternatives for the respective interests of AEP Texas and PSO in the Oklaunion Power Station.  AEPEP also has interest in the Oklaunion Power Station through its PPA with AEP Texas in which AEPEP receives the entire output of AEP Texas  share of the Oklaunion Power Station through December 2027. Management has not made a decision regarding the potential alternatives, nor have they set a specific timeframe for a decision.  Certain of these alternatives could result in an impairment, a loss and/or could reduce future net income and cash flow and harm financial condition. 
    
  AEPTCo depends on its affiliates in the AEP System for a substantial portion of its revenues.  (Applies to AEPTCo) 
    
  AEPTCo s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the AEP System. Management expects that these affiliates will continue to be AEPTCo s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2017, its affiliates were responsible for approximately 80% of the consolidated transmission revenues of     AEPTCo. 
    
  Most of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates.  (Applies to AEPTCo) 
    
  AEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located. Instead, under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective AEP System utility affiliate that overlay its operations. The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property. AEP can give no assurance that (a) the relevant AEP System utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP System utility affiliates are not its affiliates, and (c) the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption. 
    
  RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWER 
    
  Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo) 
    
  Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  A majority of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Costs of compliance  
  
   42 

with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated.  Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.   
    
  Regulation of CO   2    emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo) 
    
  In 2014, the Federal EPA issued standards for new, modified and reconstructed units, and a guideline for the development of state implementation plans that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units.  The standards and guidelines were finalized in 2015, and have been challenged by several dozen states as well as industry groups and other stakeholders.  The U.S. Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the guidelines for existing sources, known as the Clean Power Plan, until a final decision is issued by the courts.  In 2017, the Federal EPA issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, and an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking information that should be considered in the development of new emission guidelines. 
    
  CO   2    standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates for retirement of AEP s coal-fired units.  AEP typically recovers costs of complying with new requirements such as the potential CO   2    and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions. 
    
  Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo) 
    
  In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants  power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications of AEP s existing coal-fired power plants could be required and AEP might be required to limit or reduce emissions.  Such remedies could require AEP to purchase power from third parties to fulfill AEP s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on costs.  In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  While management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in AEP jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis, without such recovery, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation. 
    
  AEP s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. 

43 

Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce energy consumption.  Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.  Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity. 
    
  Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo) 
    
  AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position. 
    
  AEP s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices. 
    
  In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations. 
    
  Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as  part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.  AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict. 
    
  AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP s power. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure. 
    
  The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets. 

44 

OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support.  (Applies to AEP, APCo, I M and OPCo)  
    
  AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it.  Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MW) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I M and OPCo is 43.47%.  If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness.  OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.4 billion.  
    
  In late 2016, a nonaffiliated party to the ICPA announced its intention to exit its merchant business and that it may pursue restructuring or bankruptcy.  This party s aggregate power participation ratio is approximately 8% under the ICPA. Presently, this party has yet to pursue restructuring or bankruptcy.  However, as a result of this announcement and other related developments, Moody s downgraded OVEC s rating with a negative outlook for possible downgrade, while Fitch and S P have revised OVEC s outlook to negative.  
    
  If OVEC does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, there is risk that APCo, I M and/or OPCo may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments.  Further, if OVEC s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%.  Also, as a result of the credit rating agencies  actions, OVEC s ability to access capital markets on terms as favorable as previously may diminish and its financing costs may rise.

    Reflects ownership as of December 31,2017.  Effective January 16, 2018, 20.1% of each entity was transferred to a nonaffiliate partner in exchange for their contribution of full turbine sets to each project.  As a result, these subsidiaries became joint ventures. 
       
  As of December 31, 2017, the Generation   Marketing segment held approximately 180 MWs of solar power in the states of California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Texas, Utah and Vermont. 
    
  In addition to the AGR and Renewable Power generation set forth above, a subsidiary in the Generation   Marketing segment has contractual rights through 2027 from AEP Texas to 355 MWs from the Oklaunion Power Station, a coal-fired unit located in Vernon, TX.  AEP Texas co-owns the Oklaunion Power Station with PSO and several non-affiliated entities.

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES 
    
  The following tables set forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines of the AEP System and its operating companies. 
    
  Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment 

Transmission and Distribution Utilities Segment 

AEP Transmission Holdco Segment 
    
  The following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission lines of certain wholly-owned and joint venture-owned entities: 

TITLE TO PROPERTY 
    
  The AEP System s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple.  The greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the AEP System has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority.  The rights of AEP s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business.  Minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist, but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties.  AEP s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them, if necessary, to acquire, perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations.  Legislation in Ohio and Virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes. 

50 

SYSTEM TRANSMISSION LINES AND FACILITY SITING 
    
  Laws in the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities and/or routes of high-voltage transmission lines.  AEP has experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which AEP s operating companies have sought to acquire rights-of-way through condemnation.  These proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years. 

CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM 
    
  With input from its state utility commissions, the AEP System continuously assesses the adequacy of its transmission, distribution, generation and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers.  In this assessment process, assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified, as appropriate.  AEP forecasts approximately $6 billion of construction expenditures for   2018  .  Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, weather and the ability to access capital.  For additional information on AEP s construction program, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the   2017   Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Budgeted Construction Expenditures. 

POTENTIAL UNINSURED LOSSES 
    
  Some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities, including liabilities relating to damage to AEP s generation plants and costs of replacement power.  Unless allowed to be recovered through rates, future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could reduce net income and impact the financial conditions of AEP and other AEP System companies.  For risks related to owning a nuclear generating unit, see Note   6   to the financial statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies under the heading Nuclear Contingencies for information with respect to nuclear incident liability insurance.

ITEM 4.   MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE 
    
  The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) imposes stringent health and safety standards on various mining operations.  The Mine Act and its related regulations affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, equipment used in mine emergency procedures, mine plans and other matters.  SWEPCo, through its ownership of Dolet Hills Lignite Company (DHLC), a wholly-owned lignite mining subsidiary of SWEPCo, is subject to the provisions of the Mine Act.  
    
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) requires companies that operate mines to include in their periodic reports filed with the SEC, certain mine safety information covered by the Mine Act.  Exhibit 95  Mine Safety Disclosure Exhibit  contains the notices of violation and proposed assessments received by DHLC under the Mine Act for the quarter ended December 31,   2017  .

1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The condensed financial information of Parent is required as a result of the restricted net assets of AEP consolidated subsidiaries exceeding 25% of AEP consolidated net assets as of December 31,   2017  .  Parent is a public utility holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other subsidiaries, including joint ventures and equity investments.  The primary source of income for Parent is equity in its subsidiaries  earnings.  Its major source of cash is dividends from the subsidiaries.  Parent borrows the funds for the money pool that is used by the subsidiaries for their short-term cash needs. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Parent files a consolidated federal income tax return with its subsidiaries.  AEP System s current consolidated federal income tax is allocated to AEP System companies so that their current tax expense reflects a separate return result for each company in the consolidated group.  The tax benefit of Parent is allocated to its subsidiaries with taxable income. 

2.    COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Parent and its subsidiaries are parties to environmental and other legal matters.  For further discussion of commitments, guarantees and contingencies, see Note   6   in the   2017   Annual Reports. 

3.    FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
    
  The following details long-term debt outstanding as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  :

Short-term Debt 
    
  Parent s outstanding short-term debt was as follows: 

4.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  Payments on Behalf of Subsidiaries 
    
  Due to occasional time sensitivity and complexity of payments, Parent makes certain insurance, tax and benefit payments on behalf of subsidiary companies.  Parent is then fully reimbursed by the subsidiary companies. 
    
  Short-term Lending to Subsidiaries 
    
  Parent uses a commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of subsidiaries.  The program is used to fund both a Utility Money Pool, which funds the utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain nonutility subsidiaries.  In addition, the program also funds, as direct borrowers, the short-term debt requirements of other subsidiaries that are not participants in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons.  The program also allows some direct borrowers to invest excess cash with Parent. 
    
  Interest expense related to Parent s short-term borrowing is included in Interest Expense on Parent s statements of income.  Parent incurred interest expense for amounts borrowed from subsidiaries of $8 million, $2 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Interest income related to Parent s short-term lending is included in Interest Income on Parent s statements of income.  Parent earned interest income for amounts advanced to subsidiaries of $16 million, $10 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Global Borrowing Notes 
    
  Parent issued long-term debt, portions of which were loaned to its subsidiaries.  Parent pays interest on the global notes, but the subsidiaries accrue interest for their share of the global borrowing and remit the interest to Parent.  Interest income related to Parent s loans to subsidiaries is included in Interest Income on Parent s statements of income.  Parent earned interest income on loans to subsidiaries of $2 million, $1 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  Ladies and Gentlemen:  
  AEP Transmission Company, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Company ), proposes to issue and sell to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ( Citigroup ), Mizuho Securities USA LLC ( Mizuho ) and MUFG Securities Americas Inc. ( MUFG ) and the other several purchasers named in Schedule A to the Purchase Agreement (as defined below) (collectively, the  Initial Purchasers ), for whom Citigroup, Mizuho and MUFG are acting as representatives, upon the terms set forth in a purchase agreement dated September 25, 2017 (the  Purchase Agreement ), U.S. $125,000,000 principal amount of its Series D Senior Notes, 3.10% due 2026 (the  2026 Notes ) and U.S. $500,000,000 principal amount of its Series H Senior Notes, 3.75% due 2047 (the  2047 Notes , and together with the 2026 Notes, the  Initial Securities ).  The Initial Securities will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2016 (the  Original Indenture ) between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the  Trustee ), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of November 21, 2016 (the  First Supplemental Indenture ) and the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 28, 2017 (the  Second Supplemental Indenture,  and, together with the Original Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture, the  Indenture ).  As an inducement to the Initial Purchasers, the Company agrees with the Initial Purchasers, for the benefit of the holders of the Initial Securities (including, without limitation, the Initial Purchasers), the Exchange Securities (as defined below) and the Private Exchange Securities (as defined below) (collectively the  Holders ), as follows: 

1.   Registered Exchange Offer  .  The Company shall, at its own cost, prepare and, not later than 180 days after (or if the 180th day is not a business day, the first business day thereafter) the date of original issue of the Initial Securities (the  Issue Date ), file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ) a registration statement (the  Exchange Offer Registration Statement ) on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), with respect to a proposed offer (the  Registered Exchange Offer ) to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof), who are not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer, to issue and deliver to such Holders, in exchange for the Initial Securities, a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities (the  Exchange Securities ) of the Company issued under the Indenture and identical in all material respects to the Initial Securities (except for the transfer restrictions relating to the Initial Securities and the provisions relating to the matters described in Section 6 hereof) that would be registered under the Securities Act.  The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act not later than 270 days (or if the 270th day is not a business day, the first business day thereafter) after the Issue Date of the Initial Securities and shall keep the Registered Exchange Offer open for not less than 20 business days (or longer, if required by applicable law) after the date notice of the Registered Exchange Offer is mailed to the Holders (such period being called the  Exchange Offer Registration Period ). 
    
  If the Company commences the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company will be entitled to close the Registered Exchange Offer 30 days after the commencement thereof provided that the Company has accepted all the Initial Securities theretofore validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Registered Exchange Offer. 
    
  Following the declaration of the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly commence the Registered Exchange Offer, it being the objective of such Registered Exchange Offer to enable each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof) electing to exchange the Initial Securities for Exchange Securities (assuming that such Holder is not an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, acquires the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such Holder s business and has no arrangements with any person to participate in the distribution of the Exchange Securities and is not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer) to trade such Exchange Securities from and after their receipt without any limitations or restrictions under the Securities Act and without material restrictions under the securities laws of the several states of the United States. 
    
  The Company acknowledges that, pursuant to current interpretations by the Commission s staff of Section 5 of the Securities Act, in the absence of an applicable exemption therefrom, (i) each Holder that is a broker-dealer electing to exchange Initial Securities, acquired for its own account as a result of market making activities or other trading activities, for Exchange Securities (an  Exchanging Dealer ), is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information set forth in (a) Annex A hereto on the cover, (b) Annex B hereto in the  Exchange Offer Procedures  section and the  Purpose of the Exchange Offer  section, and (c) Annex C hereto in the  Plan of Distribution  section of such prospectus in connection with a sale of any such Exchange Securities received by such Exchanging Dealer pursuant to the Registered    
  
   2 

Exchange Offer and (ii) an Initial Purchaser that elects to sell Exchange Securities acquired in exchange for Initial Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information required by Items 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, as applicable, in connection with such sale. 
    
  The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective and to amend and supplement the prospectus contained therein, in order to permit such prospectus to be lawfully delivered by all persons subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act for such period of time as such persons must comply with such requirements in order to resell the Exchange Securities; provided, however, that (i) in the case where such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto must be delivered by an Exchanging Dealer or an Initial Purchaser, such period shall be the lesser of 180 days and the date on which all Exchanging Dealers and the Initial Purchasers have sold all Exchange Securities held by them (unless such period is extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) and (ii) the Company shall make such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any resale of any Exchange Securities for a period of not less than 90 days after the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer. 
    
  If, upon consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer, any Initial Purchaser holds Initial Securities acquired by it as part of its initial distribution, the Company, simultaneously with the delivery of the Exchange Securities pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer, shall issue and deliver to such Initial Purchaser upon the written request of such Initial Purchaser, in exchange (the  Private Exchange ) for the Initial Securities held by such Initial Purchaser, a like principal amount of debt securities of the Company issued under the Indenture and identical in all material respects (including the existence of restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act and the securities laws of the several states of the United States, but excluding provisions relating to the matters described in Section 6 hereof) to the Initial Securities (the  Private Exchange Securities ).  The Initial Securities, the Exchange Securities and the Private Exchange Securities are herein collectively called the  Securities . 
    
  In connection with the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company shall: 
    
  (a)  mail to each Holder a copy of the prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents; 
    
  (b)  keep the Registered Exchange Offer open for not less than 20 business days (or longer, if required by applicable law) after the date notice thereof is mailed to the Holders; 
    
  (c)  utilize the services of a depositary for the Registered Exchange Offer with an address in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, which may be the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee; 

3 

(d)  permit Holders to withdraw tendered Securities at any time prior to the close of business, New York time, on the last business day on which the Registered Exchange Offer shall remain open; and 
    
  (e)  otherwise comply with all applicable laws. 
    
  As soon as practicable after the close of the Registered Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange, as the case may be, the Company shall: 
    
  (x)    accept for exchange all the Initial Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange; 
    
  (y)    deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all the Initial Securities so accepted for exchange; and 
    
  (z)    cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each Holder of the Initial Securities, Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, equal in principal amount to the Initial Securities of such Holder so accepted for exchange. 
    
  The Indenture will provide that the Exchange Securities will not be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture and that all the Securities will vote and consent together on all matters as one class and that none of the Securities will have the right to vote or consent as a class separate from one another on any matter (except as may be provided in the Indenture with respect to votes and matters involving only certain but not all tranches of the Securities). 
    
  Interest on each Exchange Security and Private Exchange Security issued pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and in the Private Exchange will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the Initial Securities surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on the Initial Securities, from the Issue Date. 
    
  Each Holder participating in the Registered Exchange Offer shall be required to represent to the Company that at the time of the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer (i) any Exchange Securities received by such Holder will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) such Holder will have no arrangements or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the Initial Securities or the Exchange Securities within the meaning of the Securities Act, (iii) such Holder is not an  affiliate,  as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, of the Company or if it is an affiliate, such Holder will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable, (iv) if such Holder is not a broker-dealer, that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of the Exchange Securities and (v) if such Holder is a broker-dealer, that it will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Initial Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities and that it will be required to acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities. 
    
  Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the Company will ensure that (i) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and any prospectus forming    
  
   4 

part thereof and any supplement thereto complies in all material respects with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) any prospectus forming part of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, and any supplement to such prospectus, does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 
    
  2.  Shelf Registration  .    If, (i) because of any change in law or in applicable interpretations thereof by the staff of the Commission, the Company is not permitted to effect a Registered Exchange Offer, as contemplated by Section 1 hereof, (ii) the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated within 315 days of the Issue Date, (iii) any Initial Purchaser so requests with respect to the Initial Securities (or the Private Exchange Securities) not eligible to be exchanged for Exchange Securities in the Registered Exchange Offer and held by it following consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer or (iv) any Holder (other than an Exchanging Dealer) notifies the Company in writing during the 20 business days following consummation of the Exchange Offer that it was not eligible to participate in the Registered Exchange Offer or, in the case of any Holder (other than an Exchanging Dealer) that participates in the Registered Exchange Offer, such Holder does not receive freely tradeable Exchange Securities on the date of the exchange, the Company shall take the following actions: 
    
  (a)  The Company shall, at its cost, as promptly as practicable, but not later than the later of (i) 180 days (or if the 180th day is not a business day, the first business day thereafter) after such obligation arises and (ii) 270 days (or if the 270th day is not a business day, the first business day thereafter) after the Issue Date of the Initial Securities, file with the Commission and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective (unless it becomes effective automatically upon filing) a registration statement (the  Shelf Registration Statement  and, together with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, a  Registration Statement ) on an appropriate form under the Securities Act relating to the offer and sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof) by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule 415 under the Securities Act (hereinafter, the  Shelf Registration  provided, however, that no Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) shall be entitled to have the Securities held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder agrees in writing to be bound by all the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder. 
    
  (b)  The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the prospectus included therein to be lawfully delivered by the Holders of the relevant Securities, for a period of one year (or for such longer period if extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) from the Issue Date or such shorter period that will terminate upon the earlier of the date (i) when all the Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto, (ii) when all the Securities covered by the Registration Statement are    
  
   5 

distributed to the public pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or any successor rule thereof, are saleable pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or any successor rule thereof, or are otherwise no longer restricted securities (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or any successor rule thereof) and (iii) when all the Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement cease to be outstanding.  The Company shall be deemed not to have used its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the requisite period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Securities during that period, unless such action is required by applicable law. 
    
  (c)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall cause the Shelf Registration Statement and the related prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of its respective effective date, (i) to comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission and (ii) not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  (b)  The Company shall give written notice to the Holders of the Securities and any Participating Broker-Dealer from whom the Company has received prior written notice that it will be a Participating Broker-Dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer (which notice pursuant to clauses (ii)-(v) hereof shall be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite changes have been made): 
    
  (i)  when the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto has been filed with the Commission and when the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective; 
    
  (ii)  of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein or for additional information; 
    
  (iii)  of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, of the issuance by the Commission of a notification of objection to the use of the form on which the Registration Statement has been filed, and of the happening of any event that causes the Company to become an  ineligible issuer,  as defined in Commission Rule 405; 
    
  (iv)  of the receipt by the Company or its legal counsel of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and 
    
  (v)  of the happening of any event that requires the Company to make changes in the Registration Statement or the prospectus in order that the Registration Statement or the prospectus do not contain an untrue statement of a material fact nor omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading. 
    
  (c)  The Company shall make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal at the earliest possible time, of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement. 
    
  (d)  The Company shall furnish to each Holder of Securities included within the coverage of the Shelf Registration, without charge, at least one copy of the Shelf Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment or supplement thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if the Holder so requests in writing, all exhibits thereto (including those, if any, incorporated by reference).  The Company shall not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a  free writing prospectus,  as defined in Commission Rule 405. 
  
   7 

(e)  The Company shall deliver to each Exchanging Dealer to any Holder who so requests, without charge, at least one copy of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if any Holder requests, all exhibits thereto (including those incorporated by reference). 
    
  (f)  The Company shall, during the period that the Shelf Registration Statement is effective, deliver to each Holder of Securities included within the coverage of the Shelf Registration, without charge, as many copies of the prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) included in the Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as such person may reasonably request.  The Company consents, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, to the use of the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders of the Securities in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities covered by the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, included in the Shelf Registration Statement. 
    
  (g)  The Company shall deliver to each Initial Purchaser, who so requests, any Exchanging Dealer, any Participating Broker-Dealer and such other persons required to deliver a prospectus following the Registered Exchange Offer, without charge, as many copies of the final prospectus included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as such persons may reasonably request.  The Company consents, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, to the use of the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by any Initial Purchaser, if necessary, any Participating Broker-Dealer and such other persons required to deliver a prospectus following the Registered Exchange Offer in connection with the offering and sale of the Exchange Securities covered by the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, included in such Exchange Offer Registration Statement. 
    
  (h)  Prior to any public offering of the Securities, pursuant to any Registration Statement, the Company shall register or qualify or cooperate with the Holders of the Securities included therein and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or  blue sky  laws of such states of the United States as any Holder of the Securities reasonably requests in writing and do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the offer and sale in such jurisdictions of the Securities covered by such Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or (ii) take any action which would subject it to general service of process or to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or to comply with any other requirements reasonably deemed by the Company to be unduly burdensome. 
    
  (i)  The Company shall cooperate with the Holders of the Securities to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing the Securities to be sold pursuant to any Registration Statement free of any restrictive legends and in such denominations and registered in such names as the Holders may request a reasonable period of time prior to sales of the Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. 
  
   8 

(j)  Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by paragraphs (ii) through (v) of Section 3(b) above during the period for which the Company is required to maintain an effective Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and file a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus and any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to Holders of the Securities or purchasers of Securities, the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  If the Company notifies the Holders of the Securities and any known Participating Broker-Dealer in accordance with paragraphs (ii) through (v) of Section 3(b) above to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite changes to the prospectus have been made, then the Holders of the Securities and any such Participating Broker-Dealers shall suspend use of such prospectus, and the period of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement provided for in Section 2(b) above and the Exchange Offer Registration Statement provided for in Section 1 above shall each be extended by the number of days from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders of the Securities and any known Participating Broker-Dealer shall have received such amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to this Section 3(j).  During the period during which the Company is required to maintain an effective Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will prior to the three-year expiration of that Shelf Registration Statement file, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective (unless it becomes effective automatically upon filing) within a period that avoids any interruption in the ability of Holders of Securities covered by the expiring Shelf Registration Statement to make registered dispositions, a new registration statement relating to the Securities, which shall be deemed the  Shelf Registration Statement  for purposes of this Agreement. 
    
  (k)  Not later than the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement, the Company will provide a CUSIP number for the Initial Securities, the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, and provide the applicable trustee with printed certificates for the Initial Securities, the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company. 
    
  (l)  The Company will comply with all rules and regulations of the Commission to the extent and so long as they are applicable to the Registered Exchange Offer or the Shelf Registration and will make generally available to its security holders (or otherwise provide in accordance with Section 11(a) of the Securities Act) an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, no later than 45 days after the end of a 12-month period (or 90 days, if such period is a fiscal year) beginning with the first month of the Company s first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which statement shall cover such 12-month period. 
    
  (m)  The Company shall cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the  Trust Indenture Act ), in a timely manner and  
  
   9 

containing such changes, if any, as shall be necessary for such qualification.  In the event that such qualification would require the appointment of a new trustee under the Indenture, the Company shall appoint a new trustee thereunder pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture. 
    
  (n)  The Company may require each Holder of Securities to be sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the distribution of the Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably require for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement, and the Company may exclude from such registration the Securities of any Holder that unreasonably fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request. 
    
  (o)  The Company shall enter into such customary agreements (including, if requested, an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take all such other action, if any, as any Holder of the Securities shall reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Securities pursuant to any Shelf Registration. 
    
  (p)  In the case of any Shelf Registration, the Company shall (i) make reasonably available for inspection by the Holders of the Securities, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Holders of the Securities or any such underwriter all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and (ii) cause the Company s officers, directors, employees, accountants and auditors to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by the Holders of the Securities or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, in each case, as shall be reasonably necessary to enable such persons, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of Section II of the Securities Act; provided, however, that the foregoing inspection and information gathering shall be coordinated on behalf of the Initial Purchasers by you and on behalf of the other parties, by one counsel designated by and on behalf of such other parties as described in Section 4 hereof. 
    
  (q)  In the case of any Shelf Registration, the Company, if requested by any Holder of Securities covered thereby, shall cause (i) its counsel to deliver an opinion and updates thereof relating to the Securities in customary form addressed to such Holders and the managing underwriters, if any, thereof and dated, in the case of the initial opinion, the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement (it being agreed that the matters to be covered by such opinion shall include, without limitation, the due incorporation and good standing of the Company; the due authorization, execution and delivery of the relevant agreement of the type referred to in Section 3(o) hereof; the due authorization, execution, authentication and issuance, and the validity and enforceability, of the applicable Securities; the absence of governmental approvals required to be obtained in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, the offering and sale of the applicable Securities, or any agreement of the type referred to in Section 3(o) hereof; the compliance as to form of such Shelf Registration Statement and any documents incorporated by reference therein and of the Indenture with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act, respectively; as of the date of the opinion and  
  
   10 

as of the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement or most recent post-effective amendment thereto or most recent prospectus supplement thereto that is deemed to establish a new effective date, as the case may be, the absence from such Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus and any prospectus supplement included therein, as then amended or supplemented and including any documents incorporated by reference therein, of an untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and as of an applicable time identified by such Holders or managing underwriters, the absence from the prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as amended or supplemented at such applicable time and including any documents incorporated by reference therein, taken together with any other documents identified by such Holders or managing underwriters, of an untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) its officers to execute and deliver all customary documents and certificates and updates thereof requested by any underwriters of the applicable Securities and (iii) its independent public accountants and the independent public accountants with respect to any other entity for which financial information is provided in the Shelf Registration Statement to provide to the selling Holders of the applicable Securities and any underwriter therefor a comfort letter in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in comfort letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings, subject to receipt of appropriate documentation as contemplated, and only if permitted, by AS 6101. 
    
  (r)  In the case of the Registered Exchange Offer, if requested by any Initial Purchaser or any known Participating Broker-Dealer, the Company shall cause (i) its counsel to deliver to such Initial Purchaser or such Participating Broker-Dealer a signed opinion in the forms set forth in the Purchase Agreement with such changes as are customary in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement and (ii) its independent public accountants and the independent public accountants with respect to any other entity for which financial information is provided in the Registration Statement to deliver to such Initial Purchaser or such Participating Broker-Dealer a comfort letter, in customary form, meeting the requirements as to the substance thereof as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, with appropriate date changes. 
    
  (s)  If a Registered Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange is to be consummated, upon delivery of the Initial Securities by Holders to the Company (or to such other Person as directed by the Company) in exchange for the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall mark, or caused to be marked, on the Initial Securities so exchanged that such Initial Securities are being canceled in exchange for the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be; in no event shall the Initial Securities be marked as paid or otherwise satisfied. 
    
  (t)  The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) if the Initial Securities have been rated prior to the initial sale of such Initial Securities, confirm such ratings will apply to the Securities covered by a Registration Statement, or (b) if the  
  
   11 

Initial Securities were not previously rated, cause the Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be rated with the applicable rating agencies, if so requested by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities covered by such Registration Statement, or by the managing underwriters, if any. 
    
  (u)  In the event that any broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act shall underwrite any Securities or participate as a member of an underwriting syndicate or selling group or  assist in the distribution  (within the meaning of the Conduct Rules (the  Rules ) of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.) thereof, whether as a Holder of such Securities or as an underwriter, a placement or sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect thereof, or otherwise, the Company will assist such broker-dealer in complying with the requirements of such Rules, including, without limitation, by (i) if such Rules, including Rule 2720, shall so require, engaging a  qualified independent underwriter  (as defined in Rule 2720) to participate in the preparation of the Registration Statement relating to such Securities, to exercise usual standards of due diligence in respect thereto and, if any portion of the offering contemplated by such Registration Statement is an underwritten offering or is made through a placement or sales agent, to recommend the yield of such Securities, (ii) indemnifying any such qualified independent underwriter to the extent of the indemnification of underwriters provided in Section 5 hereof and (iii) providing such information to such broker-dealer as may be required in order for such broker-dealer to comply with the requirements of the Rules. 
    
  (v)  The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all other steps necessary to effect the registration of the Securities covered by a Registration Statement contemplated hereby. 
    
  4.  Registration Expenses  .  The Company shall bear all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under Sections 1 through 3 hereof, whether or not the Registered Exchange Offer or a Shelf Registration is filed or becomes effective, and, in the event of a Shelf Registration, shall bear or reimburse the Holders of the Securities covered thereby for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one firm of counsel designated by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Initial Securities covered thereby to act as counsel for the Holders of the Initial Securities in connection therewith. 
    
  5.  Indemnification  .    (a)    To the extent permitted by law, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Securities, any Participating Broker-Dealer, and the employees, agents, officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls such holder or Participating Broker Dealer within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Holder, Participating Broker-Dealer or control person, they or any of you or them may become subject under the Act or otherwise, and to reimburse the  Holder, Participating Broker-Dealer or control person, they or any of you or them, for any legal or other expenses incurred by you or them in connection with defending any action, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any alleged untrue statement or untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment thereto or in any preliminary prospectus or  issuer free writing prospectus , as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act ( Issuer  
  
   12 

FWP ) relating to a Shelf Registration, or arise out of or are based upon any alleged omission or omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any such alleged untrue statement or omission, or untrue statement or omission which was made in any such document  in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Holder expressly for use therein. Each Holder agrees promptly after its receipt of written notice of the commencement of any action in respect to which indemnity from the Company on account of its agreement contained in this Section 5(a) may be sought by any such Holder or by any person controlling any such Holder, to notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the Company of any such action shall not release the Company from any liability which it may have to a Holder or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 5(a). In case any such action shall be brought against a Holder or any such controlling person and a Holder shall notify the Company of the commencement thereof, as above provided, the Company shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, including the selection of counsel (such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party), to direct the defense thereof at its own expense. In case the Company elects to direct such defense and select such counsel (hereinafter, Company's counsel), a Holder or any controlling person shall have the right to employ its own counsel, but, in any such case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at such Holder's or controlling person's expense unless (i) the Company has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both a Holder or any controlling person and the Company and such Holder or any controlling person shall have been advised by its counsel that a conflict of interest between the Company and such Holder or any controlling person may arise (and the Company's counsel shall have concurred in good faith with such advice) and for this reason it is not desirable for the Company's counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party (it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for a Holder or any controlling person (plus any local counsel retained by such Holder or any controlling person in their reasonable judgment), which firm (or firms) shall be designated in writing by such Holder or any controlling person). 
    
  (b)  Each Holder, severally and not jointly, agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the Company, its directors and such of its officers, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in Section 5(a) hereof, but only with respect to untrue statements or alleged untrue statements or omissions or alleged omissions made in a Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment thereto or in any preliminary prospectus or an Issuer FWP relating to a Shelf Registration  in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein. The Company agrees promptly after the receipt by it of written notice of the commencement of any action in respect to which indemnity from a Holder on account of the agreement contained in this Section 5(b) may be sought by the Company, or by any person controlling the Company, to notify such Holder in writing of  
  
   13 

the commencement thereof, but the Company's omission so to notify such Holder of any such action shall not release such Holder from any liability which you may have to the Company or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 5(b). 
    
  (c)  If recovery is not available or insufficient to hold the indemnified party harmless under Section 5(a) or 5(b) hereof for any reason other than as specified therein, the indemnified party shall be entitled to contribution for any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses for which such indemnification is so unavailable or insufficient under this Section 5(c). In determining the amount of contribution to which such indemnified party is entitled, there shall be considered the relative benefits received by such Holder and the Company from the exchange of Securities pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer that were the subject of the claim of indemnification (taking into account the portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Initial Securities realized by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand), the relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and any equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The Company and such Holder agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) without reference to the considerations called for in the previous sentence. No Holder or any person controlling such Holder shall be obligated to contribute any amount or amounts hereunder which in the aggregate exceeds the total amount of Initial Securities exchanged by such Holder under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages which such Holder and its controlling persons have otherwise been required to pay in respect of the same claim or any substantially similar claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. A Holder's obligation to contribute under this Section 5 is in proportion to its purchase obligation and not joint with any other Holder. 
    
  (d)  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 5 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party. 
    
  (e)  In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent. 
  
   14 

6.  Additional Interest Under Certain Circumstances  .  (a)  Additional Interest (the  Additional Interest ) with respect to the Initial Securities shall be assessed as follows if any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (i) through (iii) below a  Registration Default ): 
    
  (i)  If (a) neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor a Shelf Registration Statement (if required) has been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods specified in Section 1 or Section 2 hereof or (b) neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor a Shelf Registration Statement (if required) has been declared effective by the Commission within the applicable time periods specified in Section 1 or Section 2 hereof; 
    
  (ii)  If the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated on or before the date that is 315 days (or if the 315th day is not a business day, the first business day thereafter) after the Issue Date of the Initial Securities; 
    
  (iii)  If after either the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective (A) such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective; or (B) such Registration Statement or the related prospectus ceases to be usable (except as permitted in paragraph (b)) in connection with resales of Transfer Restricted Securities during the periods specified herein because either (1) any event occurs as a result of which the related prospectus forming part of such Registration Statement would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, (2) it shall be necessary to amend such Registration Statement or supplement the related prospectus, to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, or (3) such Registration Statement is a Shelf Registration Statement that has expired before a replacement Shelf Registration Statement has become effective. 
    
  Additional Interest shall be payable with respect to the principal amount of the Initial Securities at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days from and including the date on which any Registration Default occurs, and such Additional Interest rate shall increase by an additional 0.25% per annum thereafter; provided, however, that the Additional Interest rate on the Initial Securities shall not exceed at any time 0.5% per annum; and provided further that Additional Interest shall cease to accrue on and after the date on which all such Registration Defaults have been cured (which shall not, however, affect the Company s obligations hereunder to pay Additional Interest that have accrued to such date and that remain unpaid). 
    
  (b)  A Registration Default referred to in Section 6(a)(iii)(B) hereof shall be deemed not to have occurred and be continuing in relation to a Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus if (i) such Registration Default has occurred solely as a result of (x) the filing of a post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement to incorporate annual audited financial information with respect to the Company where such post-effective amendment is not yet effective and needs to be declared effective to permit Holders to use the related prospectus or (y) other material  
  
   15 

events, with respect to the Company that would need to be described in such Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus and (ii) in the case of clause (y), the Company is proceeding promptly and in good faith to amend or supplement such Shelf Registration Statement and related prospectus to describe such events; provided, however, that in any case if such Registration Default occurs for a continuous period in excess of 30 days, Additional Interest shall be payable in accordance with the above paragraph from the day such Registration Default occurs until such Registration Default is cured. 
    
  (c)  Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 6(a) above will be payable in cash on the regular interest payment dates with respect to the Initial Securities and shall be payable to the same persons and in the same manner as regular interest.  The amount of Additional Interest will be determined by multiplying the applicable Additional Interest rate by the principal amount of the Initial Securities, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Additional Interest rate was applicable during such period (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months), and the denominator of which is 360.  The Company agrees to provide the Trustee prompt written notice of the occurrence or cure of any Registration Default. 
    
  (d)   Transfer Restricted Securities  means each Security until (i) the date on which such Transfer Restricted Security has been exchanged by a person other than a broker-dealer for a freely transferable Exchange Security in the Registered Exchange Offer, (ii) following the exchange by a broker-dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer of a Initial Security for an Exchange Note, the date on which such Exchange Note is sold to a purchaser who receives from such broker-dealer on or prior to the date of such sale a copy of the prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, (iii) the date on which such Initial Security has been effectively registered under the Securities Act and disposed of in accordance with the Shelf Registration Statement or (iv) the date on which such Initial Securities is distributed to the public pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. 
    
  7.  Rules 144 and 144A  .  The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder of Initial Securities, make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of their securities pursuant to Rules 144 and 144A.  The Company covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder of Initial Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Initial Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 144A (including the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4)).  The Company will provide a copy of this Agreement to prospective purchasers of Initial Securities identified to the Company by the Initial Purchasers upon request.  Upon the request of any Holder of Initial Securities, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act. 

16 

8.  Underwritten Registrations  .  If any of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by any Shelf Registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering ( Managing Underwriters ) will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Transfer Restricted Securities to be included in such offering, subject to the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). 
    
  No person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person s Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 
    
  9.  Miscellaneous  . 
    
  (a)  Amendments and Waivers  .  The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, except by the Company and the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities affected by such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consents. 
    
  (b)  Notices  .  All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand delivery, first-class mail, facsimile transmission, or air courier which guarantees overnight delivery:

ANNEX A 
    
  Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.  The Letter of Transmittal states that by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an  underwriter  within the meaning of the Securities Act.  This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Initial Securities where such Initial Securities were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities.  The Company has agreed that, for a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date (as defined herein), it will make this Prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale.  See  Plan of Distribution.  

ANNEX B 
    
  Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Initial Securities, where such Initial Securities were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.  See  Plan of Distribution.  

ANNEX C 
  PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION 
    
  Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.  This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Initial Securities where such Initial Securities were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities.  The Company has agreed that, for a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date, it will make this prospectus, as amended or supplemented, available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale.  In addition, until [          ], all dealers effecting transactions in the Exchange Securities may be required to deliver a prospectus. In addition, the legend required by Item 502(e) of Regulation S-K will appear on the back cover page of the Exchange Offer prospectus. 
    
  The Company will not receive any proceeds from any sale of Exchange Securities by broker-dealers.  Exchange Securities received by broker-dealers for their own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer may be sold from time to time in one or more transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing of options on the Exchange Securities or a combination of such methods of resale, at market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or negotiated prices.  Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such broker-dealer or the purchasers of any such Exchange Securities.  Any broker-dealer that resells Exchange Securities that were received by it for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such Exchange Securities may be deemed to be an  underwriter  within the meaning of the Securities Act and any profit on any such resale of Exchange Securities and any commission or concessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Securities Act.  The Letter of Transmittal states that, by acknowledging that it will deliver and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an  underwriter  within the meaning of the Securities Act. 
    
  For a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date the Company will promptly send additional copies of this Prospectus and any amendment or supplement to this Prospectus to any broker-dealer that requests such documents in the Letter of Transmittal.  The Company has agreed to pay all expenses incident to the Exchange Offer (including the expenses of one counsel for the Holders of the Securities) other than commissions or concessions of any brokers or dealers and will indemnify the Holders of the Securities (including any broker-dealers) against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. 

1   In addition, the legend required by Item 502(e) of Regulation S-K will appear on the back cover page of the Exchange Offer prospectus.

  Awards may be granted to any Participant from time to time by the Committee. The Committee shall determine the terms, conditions, and limitations applicable to each Award consistent with the Plan. Designation by the Committee as a Participant for an Award in one period shall not confer on such Participant the right to participate in the Plan for any other period.  
    
  ARTICLE IV  
  INCENTIVE AWARDS    
    
  Section 4.1. General.  
    
           (a) 
    Awards may be granted to a Participant in such amounts and upon such terms, and at any time and from time to time, as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee, at the time an Award is made, shall specify the terms and conditions which govern the Award, which terms and conditions shall prescribe that the Award shall be earned only upon, and to the extent that, Performance Objectives as described in Section 4.2, are satisfied within a designated time.  
       
           (b) 
    Different terms and conditions may be established by the Committee for different Awards and for different Participants with respect to the same or different Performance Periods.  
       
  Section 4.2. Performance Objectives.   The vesting and payment of Awards shall be contingent upon the degree of attainment of such performance goal(s) (the  Performance Objectives ) over such period (the  Performance Period ) as shall be specified by the Committee at the time the Award is granted. Performance Objectives will be established prior to or within the first ninety (90) days of each Performance Period (or within the first 25% of the Performance Period, if the Performance Period is shorter than 360 days).  
    
   The criteria for developing the Performance Objectives upon which payment or vesting of an Award intended to qualify for the exemption under Code Section 162(m) may be based shall be limited to one or more of the following, as determined by the Committee: (i) earnings measures: primary earnings per share; fully diluted earnings per share; net income; pre-tax income; operating income; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; net operating profits after taxes; income before income taxes, minority interest and equity earnings; income before discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes, or any combination thereof; (ii) expense control: operations   maintenance expense; total expenditures; expense ratios; and expense reduction; (iii) customer measures: customer satisfaction; service cost; service levels; responsiveness; bad debt collections or losses; and reliability-such as outage frequency, outage duration, and frequency of momentary outages; (iv) safety measures: recordable case rate; severity rate; and vehicle accident rate; (v) diversity measures: minority placement rate and utilization; (vi) environmental measures: emissions; project completion milestones; regulatory/legislative/cost recovery goals; and notices of violation; (vii) revenue measures: revenue and margin; (viii) shareholder return measures: total shareholder return; economic value added; cumulative shareholder value added; return on equity; return on capital; return on assets; dividend payout ratio and cash flow(s)-such as operating cash flows, free cash flow, discounted cash flow return on investment and cash flow in excess of cost of capital or any combination thereof; (ix) valuation measures: stock price increase; price to book value ratio; and price to earnings ratio; (x) capital and risk measures: debt to equity ratio and dividend payout as percentage of net income; (xi) employee satisfaction; (xii) project measures: completion of key milestones; (xiii) production measures: generating capacity factor; performance against the Institute of Nuclear Power Operation index; generating equivalent availability; heat rates and production cost. The targeted level or levels of performance with respect to such business criteria may be established at such levels and in such terms as the Committee may determine, in its discretion, including in absolute terms, as a goal relative to performance in prior periods (e.g., earnings growth), or as a goal compared to the performance of one or more comparable companies or an index covering multiple companies.  
  
   2 

Performance Objectives may relate to attainment of specified objectives by the Participant or by the Company or one or more Subsidiaries, including a division or a department of the Company or of one or more Subsidiaries.  
    
  Section 4.3. Payment of Awards.   An Award shall not become payable unless, after the expiration of the Performance Period, the Committee has certified either that the Performance Objectives with respect to such Award have been satisfied or the level of attainment of each Performance Objective. Unless otherwise expressly stated in the terms and conditions of a particular Award, the Committee retains the power, authority and discretion to reduce or eliminate, but not to increase, the amount calculated as payable under the terms of any Award in order to reflect other performance criteria. Payment of such Awards that have been certified shall be made to Participants in a single lump sum in cash at such time determined by the Committee, and generally no later than two and one-half months after the end of the Performance Period; provided that unless otherwise clearly specified in the terms and conditions of a particular Award, payment shall be made no later than 2-1/2 months after the end of the calendar year during which the Award became vested, or as soon as practical thereafter. In no event shall any Participant receive an Award payment or payments in any fiscal year that exceeds the lesser of (i) $6,000,000 or (ii) 400% of the Participant s base salary (prior to any salary reduction or deferral elections) as of the date of grant of the Award.  
    
  Section  4.4. Recoupment of Incentive Compensation.   Each Participant who is granted an Award shall reimburse the amount awarded, earned, received or paid under such Award if the Committee, in its discretion, determines that: (i) the Award or any compensation resulting from it was predicated upon the achievement of financial or other results that were subsequently materially restated or corrected, and (ii) the Award or any compensation resulting from it would have been materially lower had the achievement been calculated on such restated or corrected financial results. If and to the extent that the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that the conditions set forth in (i) and (ii) have been met and such reimbursement is warranted by the facts and circumstances of the particular case or if the applicable legal requirements impose more stringent requirements on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to obtain reimbursement of such compensation, then the Participant will be required to reimburse Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for the value of such compensation paid to that Participant. The Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, also may retain any deferred compensation previously credited to the Participant and not paid, provided that the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, will retain such deferred compensation only if, when and to the extent that it otherwise becomes payable to the Participant. This right to reimbursement is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any and all other rights the Company and its Subsidiaries might have to pursue reimbursement or such other remedies against an employee for misconduct in the course of employment or otherwise based on applicable legal considerations, all of which are expressly retained by the Company and its Subsidiaries.  
    
  ARTICLE V  
  ADMINISTRATION    
    
  The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall have all of the powers necessary to enable it to properly carry out its duties under the Plan. Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Committee shall have the power and discretion to construe and interpret the Plan and to determine all questions that shall arise thereunder. The Committee shall have such other and further specified duties, powers, authority and discretion as are elsewhere in the Plan either expressly or by necessary implication conferred upon it. The Committee may appoint such agents, who need not be members of the Committee, as it may deem necessary for the effective performance of its duties, and may delegate to such agents such powers and duties as the Committee may deem expedient or appropriate that are not inconsistent with the intent of the Plan to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. The decision of the Committee or any agent of the Committee upon all matters within the scope of its authority shall be final and conclusive on all persons.  
    
  ARTICLE VI  
  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION    
    
  Section 6.1. Amendment of Plan.   The Company has the right, at any time and from time to time, to amend in whole or in part any of the terms and provisions of the Plan to the extent permitted by law for whatever reason(s) the Company may deem appropriate; provided, however, that any such amendment which requires approval of the 
  
   3 

Company s shareholders in order to maintain the qualification of Awards as performance-based compensation pursuant to Code Section 162(m) (4)(C) shall not be made without such approval.  
    
  Section 6.2. Termination of Plan.   The Company expressly reserves the right, at any time, to suspend or terminate the Plan to the extent permitted by law for whatever reason(s) the Company may deem appropriate, including, without limitation, suspension or termination as to any Subsidiary, Employee, or class of Employees.  
    
  Section 6.3. Procedure for Amendment or Termination.   Any amendment to the Plan or termination of the Plan shall be made by the Company by resolution of the Committee and shall not require the approval or consent of any Subsidiary or Participant to be effective to the extent permitted by law. Any amendment to the Plan or termination of the Plan may be retroactive to the extent not prohibited by applicable law.  
    
  ARTICLE VII  
  MISCELLANEOUS    
    
  Section 7.1. Rights of Employees.   Status as an eligible Employee shall not be construed as a commitment that any Award will be made under the Plan to such eligible Employee or to eligible Employees generally. Nothing contained in the Plan (or in any other documents related to this Plan or to any Award) shall confer upon any Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company or any Subsidiary or constitute any contract or limit in any way the right of the Company to change such person s compensation or other benefits or to terminate the employment or service of such person with or without cause.  
    
  Section  7.2. Unfunded Status.   The Plan shall be unfunded. Neither the Company, nor any Subsidiary, nor the Committee, nor the Board shall be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by Awards made pursuant to the Plan. Neither the Company, nor any Subsidiary, nor the Committee, nor the Board shall be deemed to be a trustee of any amounts to be paid under the Plan.  
    
  Section 7.3. Limits on Liability.   Any liability of the Company or any Subsidiary to any Participant with respect to an Award shall be based solely upon contractual obligations created by the Plan. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any member of the Board or the Committee, nor any other person participating in any determination of any question under the Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application of the Plan, shall have any liability to any party for any action taken or not taken in good faith under the Plan. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Board and the Committee from and against any and all liability, claims, demands, costs, and expenses (including the costs and expenses of attorneys incurred in connection with the investigation or defense of claims) in any manner connected with or arising out of any actions or inactions in connection with the administration of the Plan except for such actions or inactions which are not in good faith or which constitute willful misconduct.  
    
  Section 7.4. Interpretation.   Unless otherwise expressly stated by the Committee with respect to an Award, each Award granted to a Covered Employee under the Plan is intended to (i) be Performance-Based Compensation that is fully deductible by the Company for federal income taxes and not subject to the deduction limitation of Section 162(m) of the Code and (ii) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A (including by reason of being exempt from the application of Code Section 409A), and the Plan shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent possible to conform any Award to effect such intent. The Committee shall not have any discretion to determine that an Award will be paid to a Covered Employee if the Performance Objective for such Award is not attained.  
    
  Section 7.5. Tax Withholding.   The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any payment made under the Plan the full amount of any required federal, state or local taxes or such other amounts as may be required by applicable law.  
    
  Section 7.6. Non-transferability of Benefits.   A Participant may not assign or transfer any interest in an Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the death of a Participant, the Participant s rights and benefits under the Plan shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  
  
   4 

Section 7.7. Governing Law.   To the extent not governed by federal law, the Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio.  
    
  ARTICLE VIII  
  EFFECTIVE DATE; DURATION OF THE PLAN    
    
  The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, this Plan shall be subject to approval by a vote of the shareholders of the Company at its 2017 annual meeting, and such shareholder approval shall be a pre-condition to the right of any Participant to receive any benefits pursuant to an Award made under this Plan on or after the Effective Date.

AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
    
  Company Overview 
    
  AEP is one of the largest investor-owned electric public utility holding companies in the United States.  AEP s electric utility operating companies provide generation, transmission and distribution services to more than five million retail customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. 
    
  AEP s subsidiaries operate an extensive portfolio of assets including: 

Approximately 219,000     miles of distribution lines that deliver electricity to 5.4 million customers. 
                
    Approximately 40,000 circuit miles of transmission lines, including approximately 2,100 circuit     miles of 765 kV lines, the backbone of the electric interconnection grid in the Eastern United States. 
                
    AEP Transmission Holdco has approximately $5.8 billion of transmission assets in-service. 
                
    Approximately 23,000 megawatts of regulated owned generating capacity and approximately 4,800 megawatts of regulated PPA capacity in 3 RTOs as of December 31, 2017, one of the largest complements of generation in the United States.  
       
  Customer Demand 
    
  AEP s weather-normalized retail sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 0.3% from the year ended December 31, 2016.  AEP s 2017 industrial sales volumes increased 2.8% compared to 2016.  The growth in industrial sales was spread across many industries and most operating companies.  Weather-normalized residential sales decreased 1.2% and commercial sales decreased by 0.8% in 2017, respectively, from 2016. 
    
  In 2018, AEP anticipates weather-normalized retail sales volumes will increase by 0.2%.  The industrial class is expected to remain flat in 2018, while weather-normalized residential sales volumes are projected to increase by 0.3%, primarily related to projected customer growth.  Weather-normalized commercial sales volumes are projected to increase by 0.4%. 
    
  Federal Tax Reform  
    
  In December 2017, legislation referred to as Tax Reform was signed into law.  The majority of the provisions in the new legislation are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.  Tax Reform includes significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, the Code), including amendments which significantly change the taxation of business entities and also includes provisions specific to regulated public utilities.  The more significant changes that affect the Registrants include the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and several technical provisions including, among others, limiting the utilization of net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward period.  The Tax Reform provisions related to regulated public utilities generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, eliminate bonus depreciation for certain property acquired after September 27, 2017 and continue certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. 
    
  Changes in the Code due to Tax Reform had a material impact on the Registrants  2017 financial statements.  As a result of Tax Reform, the Registrants  deferred tax assets and liabilities were re-measured using the newly enacted tax rate of 21% in December 2017.  This re-measurement resulted in a significant reduction in the Registrants  net accumulated deferred income tax liability.  With respect to the Registrants  regulated operations, the reduction of the net accumulated deferred income tax liability was primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in income tax related regulatory assets and an increase in income tax related regulatory liabilities because the benefit of the lower federal  
  
   2 

tax rate is expected to be provided to customers.  However, when the underlying asset or liability giving rise to the temporary difference was not previously contemplated in regulated rates, the re-measurement of the deferred taxes on those assets or liabilities was recorded as an adjustment to income tax expense.  For the Registrants  unregulated operations, the re-measurement of deferred taxes arising from those operations was recorded as an adjustment to income tax expense. 
    
  The following tables provide a summary of the impact of Tax Reform on the Registrants  2017 financial statements. 

This decrease in deferred income tax liabilities resulted in an increase in income tax related regulatory liabilities, a decrease in income tax related regulatory assets and an adjustment to income tax expense as shown in the table below. 

(a) 
    In 2017, in contemplation of corporate federal tax reform, the Registrants adopted a method under Internal Revenue Section 162 for deducting repair and maintenance costs associated with transmission and distribution property.  This change resulted in a decrease in state income tax expense of approximately $10 million that has been excluded from the tables above. 
              (b) 
    AEP Texas and OPCo recorded  favorable adjustments to income tax expense of approximately $113 million and $16 million related to previously owned deregulated generation assets and certain deferred fuel amounts, respectively. 
              (c) 
    The effect of Tax Reform on AEP s other business operations (other than the Registrant Subsidiaries), which primarily include unregulated activities in the Generation   Marketing segment, transmission operations reflected in the AEP Transmission Holdco segment and activities recorded in Corporate and Other, increased income tax expense for the year-ended December 31, 2017 by approximately $103 million. 
       
  Regulatory Treatment 
    
  As a result of Tax Reform, the Registrants recognized a regulatory liability for approximately $4.4 billion of excess accumulated deferred income taxes (Excess ADIT), as well as an incremental liability of $1.2 billion to reflect the $4.4 billion Excess ADIT on a pre-tax basis.  The Excess ADIT is reflected on a pre-tax basis to appropriately contemplate future tax consequences in the periods when the regulatory liability is settled.  Approximately $3.2 billion of the Excess ADIT relates to temporary differences associated with depreciable property.  The Tax Reform legislation includes certain rate normalization requirements that stipulate how the portion of the total Excess ADIT that is related to certain depreciable property must be passed back to customers.  Specifically, for AEP s regulated public utilities that are subject to those rate normalization requirements, Excess ADIT resulting from the reduction of the corporate tax rate with respect to prior depreciation or recovery deductions on property will be normalized using the average rate assumption method.  As a result, once the amortization of this Excess ADIT is reflected in rates, customers will receive the benefits over the remaining weighted average useful life of the applicable property.  
    
  For the remaining $1.2 billion of Excess ADIT, the Registrants expect to continue working with each state regulatory commission to determine the appropriate mechanism and time period over which to provide the benefits of Tax Reform to customers.  
  
   3 

The Registrants expect the mechanism and time period to provide the benefits of Tax Reform to customers will vary by jurisdiction and is not expected to have a material impact on future net income. However, the Registrants anticipate a decrease in future cash flows primarily due to the elimination of bonus depreciation, the reduction in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and the flow back of Excess ADIT.  Further, the Registrants expect that access to capital markets will be sufficient to satisfy any liquidity needs that result from any such decrease in future cash flows. 
    
  State Regulatory Matters 
    
  Various state utility commissions have recently issued orders requiring public utilities, including the Registrants, to record regulatory liabilities to reflect the corporate federal income taxes currently collected in utility rates in excess of the enacted corporate federal income tax rate of 21% beginning January 1, 2018.  See Note 4 - Rate Matters for additional information regarding state utility commission orders received impacting the Registrant Subsidiaries. 
    
  Merchant Generation Assets 
    
  In September 2016, AEP signed an agreement to sell Darby, Gavin, Lawrenceburg and Waterford Plants ( Disposition Plants ) totaling 5,329 MWs of competitive generation to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in January 2017 for approximately $2.2 billion.  The net proceeds from the transaction were approximately $1.2 billion in cash after taxes, repayment of debt associated with these assets and transaction fees, which resulted in an after tax gain of approximately $129 million.  AEP primarily used these proceeds to reduce outstanding debt and invest in its regulated businesses, including transmission and contracted renewable projects. 
    
  The assets and liabilities included in the sale transaction have been recorded as Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Held for Sale, respectively, on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.  See  Dispositions  and  Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale  sections of Note   7   for additional information. 
    
  In February 2017, AEP signed an agreement to sell its 25.4% ownership share of Zimmer Plant to Dynegy Corporation.  Simultaneously, AEP signed an agreement to purchase Dynegy Corporation s 40% ownership share of Conesville Plant, Unit 4.  The transactions closed in the second quarter of 2017 and did not have a material impact on net income, cash flows or financial condition. 
    
  In December 2017, AEP signed an amendment to the Cardinal Station Agreement with Buckeye Power Incorporated, which terminates certain commercial arrangements between the parties and transitions management oversite and administrative support of the Cardinal facility from AEP to Buckeye Power Incorporated.  The amendment required approval from Rural Utilities Service and the FERC, which were obtained in February 2018.  The new amendment will be effective March 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on net income, cash flows or financial condition. 
    
  Management continues to evaluate potential alternatives for the remaining merchant generation assets.  These potential alternatives may include, but are not limited to, transfer or sale of AEP s ownership interests, or a wind down of merchant coal-fired generation fleet operations.  Management has not set a specific time frame for a decision on these assets.  These alternatives could result in additional losses which could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

  The growth of AEP s renewable generation portfolio reflects the company s strategy to diversify generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both their energy and capacity needs.    
    
  Contracted Renewable Generation Facilities 
    
  AEP is further developing its renewable portfolio within the Generation   Marketing segment.  Activities include working directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions based upon market knowledge, technology innovations and deal structuring which may include distributed solar, wind, combined heat and power,  
  
   4 

energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other forms of cost reducing energy technologies.  Projects are pursued where a suitable termed agreement is entered into with a creditworthy counterparty.  Generation   Marketing also develops and/or acquires large scale renewable generation projects that are backed with long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties.  As of   December 31, 2017  , subsidiaries within AEP s Generation   Marketing segment have approximately 489 MWs of contracted renewable generation projects in operation.  In addition, as of   December 31, 2017  , these subsidiaries have approximately 34 MWs of new renewable generation projects under construction and estimated capital costs of $61 million related to these projects. 
    
  In January 2018, AEP entered into a partnership with a non-affiliate to own and repower Desert Sky and Trent, which is expected to be completed in 2018.  The non-affiliate partner contributed full turbine sets to each project in exchange for a 20% interest in the partnership.  AEP s 80% share of the partnership, or 248 MWs, represents $232 million of additional estimated capital, of which $90 million has been spent and is recorded in construction work in progress as of December 31, 2017.  The partnership is subject to a put and a call after certain conditions are met, either of which would liquidate the non-affiliated partner s interest. 
    
  Regulated Renewable Generation Facilities 
    
  In July 2017, APCo submitted filings with the Virginia SCC and the WVPSC requesting regulatory approval to acquire two wind generation facilities totaling approximately 225 MWs of wind generation.  The wind generating facilities are located in West Virginia and Ohio and, if approved, are anticipated to be in-service in the second half of 2019.  APCo will assume ownership of the facilities at or near the anticipated in-service date.  APCo currently plans to sell the Renewable Energy Certificates associated with the generation from these facilities.  In December 2017, the WVPSC staff and an industrial intervenor filed testimony in West Virginia and the Virginia SCC staff filed testimony in Virginia arguing that APCo s forecast of natural gas and energy prices was too high and, with the exception of the WVPSC staff s recommended approval of the facility located in West Virginia, do not support approval of APCo s acquisition of the facilities.  In January 2018, APCo filed supplemental testimony with the WVPSC to address changes in the economics of the wind projects as a result of Tax Reform.  A hearing at the Virginia SCC was held in February 2018 and a hearing is scheduled at the WVPSC in March 2018. 
    
  In July 2017, PSO and SWEPCo submitted filings     with the OCC, LPSC, APSC and PUCT requesting various regulatory approvals needed to proceed with the Wind Catcher Project.  The Wind Catcher Project includes the acquisition of a wind generation facility, totaling approximately 2,000 MWs of wind generation, and the construction of a generation interconnection tie-line totaling approximately 350 miles.  Total investment for the project is estimated to be $4.5 billion and will serve both retail and FERC wholesale load.  PSO and SWEPCo will have a 30% and 70% ownership share, respectively, in these assets.  The wind generating facility is located in Oklahoma and, if approved by all state commissions, is anticipated to be in-service by the end of 2020.  In July 2017, the LPSC approved SWEPCo s request for an exemption to the Market Based Mechanism.  In August 2017, the Oklahoma Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss with the OCC.  In August 2017, the motion to dismiss was denied by the OCC.  In December 2017, the Oklahoma Attorney General s motion to dismiss was renewed and again denied by the OCC.  Also in December 2017, the companies filed a request at FERC to transfer the wind generation facility to PSO and SWEPCo upon its construction by a third party, subject to the approval of the project at the respective state commissions.  Parties  testimony filed in the Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana dockets generally opposes the companies  request.  In the companies  rebuttal testimony filed in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana, certain commitments have been made related to the cost of the investment and operational performance.  In addition, PSO and SWEPCo committed in each jurisdiction to the timely filing of a base rate case to shorten the duration of cost recovery through a temporary mechanism.   
    
  In February 2018, the ALJ in Oklahoma recommended that PSO s request for preapproval of future recovery of Wind Catcher Project costs be denied.  Also in February 2018, SWEPCo announced a settlement agreement with the APSC staff, the Arkansas Attorney General and other parties in SWEPCo s request for approval of the Wind Catcher Project.   SWEPCo agreed to certain commitments related to the cost of the investment, qualification for 100% of the Production Tax Credits and operational performance.  The parties filed a joint motion asking the APSC to approve the Wind Catcher Project under the terms of the settlement agreement.

Hurricane Harvey 
    
  In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey hit the coast of Texas, causing power outages in the AEP Texas service territory.  As rebuilding efforts continue, AEP Texas  total costs related to this storm are not yet final.  AEP Texas  current estimated cost is approximately $325 million to $375 million, including capital expenditures.  AEP Texas has a PUCT approved catastrophe reserve which allows for the deferral of incremental storm expenses as a regulatory asset, and currently recovers approximately $1 million annually through base rates.  As of December 31, 2017, the total balance of AEP Texas  catastrophe reserve deferral is $123 million, inclusive of approximately $100 million of net incremental storm expenses related to Hurricane Harvey.  AEP Texas currently estimates that it will incur approximately $12 million of additional incremental expense related to Hurricane Harvey service restoration efforts. As of December 31, 2017, AEP Texas has recorded approximately $133 million of capital expenditures related to Hurricane Harvey. Also, as of December 31, 2017, AEP Texas has received $10 million in insurance proceeds, which were applied to the regulatory asset and property, plant and equipment.  Management, in conjunction with the insurance adjusters, is reviewing all damages to determine the extent of coverage for additional insurance reimbursement.  Any future insurance recoveries received will also be applied to, and will offset, the regulatory asset and property, plant and equipment, as applicable.  Management believes the amount recorded as a regulatory asset is probable of recovery and AEP Texas is currently evaluating recovery options for the regulatory asset.  The other named 2017 hurricanes did not have a material impact on AEP s operations.  If the ultimate costs of the incident are not recovered by insurance or through the regulatory process, it would have an adverse effect on future net income, cash flows and financial condition. 
    
  June 2015 - May 2018 ESP Including PPA Application and Proposed ESP Extension through 2024 
    
  In March 2016, a contested stipulation agreement related to the PPA rider application was modified and approved by the PUCO.  The approved PPA rider is subject to audit and review by the PUCO.  Consistent with the terms of the modified and approved stipulation agreement, and based upon a September 2016 PUCO order, in November 2016, OPCo refiled its amended ESP extension application and supporting testimony.  The amended filing proposed to extend the ESP through May 2024 and included (a) an extension of the OVEC PPA rider, (b) a proposed 10.41% return on common equity on capital costs for certain riders, (c) the continuation of riders previously approved in the June 2015 - May 2018 ESP, (d) proposed increases in rate caps related to OPCo s DIR and (e) the addition of various new riders, including a Renewable Resource Rider. 
    
  In August 2017, OPCo and various intervenors filed a stipulation agreement with the PUCO.  The stipulation extends the term of the ESP through May 2024 and includes: (a) an extension of the OVEC PPA rider, (b) a proposed 10% return on common equity on capital costs for certain riders, (c) the continuation of riders previously approved in the June 2015 - May 2018 ESP, (d) rate caps related to OPCo s DIR ranging from $215 million to $290 million for the periods 2018 through 2021, (e) the addition of various new riders, including a Smart City Rider and a Renewable Generation Rider, (f) a decrease in annual depreciation rates based on a depreciation study using data through December 2015 and (g) amortization of approximately $24 million annually beginning January 2018 of OPCo s excess distribution accumulated depreciation reserve, which was $239 million as of December 31, 2015.  Upon PUCO approval of the stipulation, effective January 2018, OPCo will cease recording $39 million in annual amortization previously approved to end in December 2018 in accordance with PUCO s December 2011 OPCo distribution base rate case order.  In the stipulation, OPCo and intervenors agree that OPCo can request in future proceedings a change in meter depreciation rates due to retired meters pursuant to the smart grid Phase 2 project.  DIR rate caps will be reset in OPCo s next distribution base rate case which must be filed by June 2020.   
    
  In October 2017, intervenor testimony opposing the stipulation agreement was filed recommending: (a) a return on common equity to not exceed 9.3% for riders earning a return on capital investments, (b) that OPCo should file a base distribution case concurrent with the conclusion of the current ESP in May 2018 and (c) denial of certain new riders proposed in OPCo s ESP extension.  The stipulation is subject to review by the PUCO.  A hearing at the PUCO was held in November 2017.      An order from the PUCO is expected in the first quarter of 2018. 
    
  If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect all components of its ESP rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  See  Ohio Electric Security Plan Filings  section of Note   4   for additional information.

2016 SEET Filing 
    
  In December 2016, OPCo recorded a 2016 SEET provision of $58 million based upon projected earnings data for companies in the comparable utilities risk group.  In determining OPCo s return on equity in relation to the comparable utilities risk group, management excluded the following items resolved in OPCo s Global Settlement:  (a) gain on the deferral of RSR costs, (b) refunds to customers related to the SEET remands and (c) refunds to customers related to fuel adjustment clause proceedings.   
    
  In May 2017, OPCo submitted its 2016 SEET filing with the PUCO in which management indicated that OPCo did not have significantly excessive earnings in 2016 based upon actual earnings data for the comparable utilities risk group.   
    
  In January 2018, the PUCO staff filed testimony that OPCo did not have significantly excessive earnings.  Also in January 2018, an intervenor filed testimony recommending a $53 million refund to customers.   
    
  In February 2018, OPCo and PUCO staff filed a stipulation agreement in which both parties agreed that OPCo did not have significantly excessive earnings in 2016. 
    
  In February 2018, a procedural schedule was issued by the PUCO.  A hearing is scheduled for April 2018 and management expects to receive an order in the second quarter of 2018.  While management believes that OPCo s adjusted 2016 earnings were not excessive, management did not adjust OPCo s 2016 SEET provision due to risks that the PUCO could rule against OPCo s proposed SEET adjustments, including treatment of the Global Settlement issues described above, adjust the comparable risk group, or adopt a different 2016 SEET threshold.  If the PUCO orders a refund of 2016 OPCo earnings, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  See  2016 SEET Filing  section of Note   4   for additional information. 
    
  Rockport Plant, Unit 2 SCR 
    
  In October 2016, I M filed an application with the IURC for approval of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to install SCR technology at Rockport Plant, Unit 2 by December 2019.  The equipment will allow I M to reduce emissions of NO   x    from Rockport Plant, Unit 2 in order for I M to continue to operate that unit under current environmental requirements. The estimated cost of the SCR project is $274 million, excluding AFUDC, to be shared equally between I M and AEGCo.  As of   December 31, 2017  , total costs incurred related to this project, including AFUDC, were approximately $23 million.  The filing included a request for authorization for I M to defer its Indiana jurisdictional ownership share of costs including investment carrying costs at a weighted average cost of capital (WACC), depreciation over a 10-year period as provided by statute and other related expenses.  I M proposed recovery of these costs using the existing Clean Coal Technology Rider in a future filing subsequent to approval of the SCR project.  The AEGCo ownership share of the proposed SCR project will be billable under the Rockport Unit Power Agreement to I M and KPCo and will be subject to future regulatory approval for recovery.   
    
  In February 2017, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) and other parties filed testimony with the IURC.  The OUCC recommended approval of the CPCN but also stated that any decision regarding recovery of any under-depreciated plant due to retirement should be fully investigated in a base rate case, not in a tracker or other abbreviated proceeding.  The other parties recommended either denial of the CPCN or approval of the CPCN with conditions including a cap on the amount of SCR costs allowed to be recovered in the rider and limitations on other costs related to legal issues involving the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease.  A hearing at the IURC was held in March 2017.  An order from the IURC is pending.  In July 2017, I M filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio to remove the requirement to install SCR technology at Rockport Plant, Unit 2, which plaintiffs opposed.  The district court has delayed the deadline for installation of the SCR technology until June 2020.  In January 2018, I M filed a supplemental motion with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio proposing to install the SCR at Rockport Plant, Unit 2 and achieve the final SO   2    emission cap applicable to the plant under the consent decree by the end of 2020, before the expiration of the initial lease term.  Responsive filings were filed in February 2018 and a decision is anticipated in the first quarter of 2018.

2017 Indiana Base Rate Case 
    
  In July 2017, I M filed a request with the IURC for a $263 million annual increase in Indiana rates based upon a proposed 10.6% return on common equity with the annual increase to be implemented after June 2018.  Upon implementation, this proposed annual increase would be subject to a temporary offsetting $23 million annual reduction to customer bills through December 2018 for a credit adjustment rider related to the timing of estimated in-service dates of certain capital expenditures.  The proposed annual increase includes $78 million related to increased annual depreciation rates and an $11 million increase related to the amortization of certain Cook Plant and Rockport Plant regulatory assets.  The increase in depreciation rates includes a change in the expected retirement date for Rockport Plant, Unit 1 from 2044 to 2028 combined with increased investment at the Cook Plant, including the Cook Plant Life Cycle Management Project. 
    
  In November 2017, various intervenors filed testimony that included annual revenue increase recommendations ranging from $125 million to $152 million.  The recommended returns on common equity ranged from 8.65% to 9.1%.  In addition, certain parties recommended longer recovery periods than I M proposed for recovery of regulatory assets and depreciation expenses related to Rockport Plant, Units 1 and 2.  In January 2018, in response to a January 2018 IURC request related to the impact of Tax Reform on I M s pending base rate case, I M filed updated schedules supporting a $191 million annual increase in Indiana base rates if the effect of Tax Reform was included in the cost of service.   
    
  In February 2018, I M and all parties to the case, except one industrial customer, filed a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement for a   $97 million   annual increase in Indiana rates effective July 1, 2018 subject to a temporary offsetting reduction to customer bills through December 2018 for a credit rider related to the timing of estimated in-service dates of certain capital expenditures.  The one industrial customer agreed to not oppose the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement.  The difference between I M s requested   $263 million   annual increase and the   $97 million   annual increase in the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement is primarily due to lower federal income taxes as a result of the reduction in the federal income tax rate due to Tax Reform, the feedback of credits for excess deferred income taxes, a   9.95%   return on equity, longer recovery periods of regulatory assets, lower depreciation expense primarily for meters, and an increase in the sharing of off-system sales margins with customers from   50%   to   95%  .  I M will also refund   $4 million   from July through December 2018 for the impact of Tax Reform for the period January through June 2018.   A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 2018.  If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
  2017 Michigan Base Rate Case 
    
  In May 2017, I M filed a request with the MPSC for a $52 million annual increase in Michigan base rates based upon a proposed 10.6% return on common equity with the increase to be implemented no later than April 2018.  The proposed annual increase includes $23 million related to increased annual depreciation rates and a $4 million increase related to the amortization of certain Cook Plant regulatory assets.  The increase in depreciation rates is primarily due to the proposed change in the expected retirement date for Rockport Plant, Unit 1 from 2044 to 2028 combined with increased investment at the Cook Plant related to the Life Cycle Management Project.  Additionally, the total proposed increase includes incremental costs related to the Cook Plant Life Cycle Management Program and increased vegetation management expenses.   
    
  In October 2017, the MPSC staff and intervenors filed testimony.  The MPSC staff recommended an annual net revenue increase of   $49 million   including proposed retirement dates of 2028 for both Rockport Plant, Units 1 (from 2044) and 2 (from 2022), a reduced capacity charge and a return on common equity of   9.8%  .  The intervenors proposed certain adjustments to I M s request including no change to the current 2044 retirement date of Rockport Plant, Unit 1, a market based capacity charge effective February 2019 for up to 10% of I M s Michigan customers, but did not address an annual net revenue increase.  The intervenors  recommended returns on common equity ranged from   9.3%   to   9.5%  .  A hearing at the MPSC was held in November 2017.  
    
  In February 2018, an MPSC ALJ issued a Proposal for Decision and recommended an annual revenue increase of   $49 million  , including the intervenors  proposed capacity charge and staff s depreciation rates for Rockport Plant and a  
  
   8 

return on common equity of   9.8%  .  If the maximum 10% of customers choose an alternate supplier starting in February 2019, the estimated annual pretax loss due to the reduced capacity charge is approximately   $9 million  .  An order is expected in the first half of 2018.  If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Merchant Portion of Turk Plant 
    
  SWEPCo constructed the Turk Plant, a base load 600 MW pulverized coal ultra-supercritical generating unit in Arkansas, which was placed into service in December 2012 and is included in the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment.  SWEPCo owns 73% (440 MWs) of the Turk Plant and operates the facility. 
    
  The APSC granted approval for SWEPCo to build the Turk Plant by issuing a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need (CECPN) for the SWEPCo Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant (approximately 20%).  Following an appeal by certain intervenors, the Arkansas Supreme Court issued a decision that reversed the APSC s grant of the CECPN.  In June 2010, in response to an Arkansas Supreme Court decision, the APSC issued an order which reversed and set aside the previously granted CECPN.  This share of the Turk Plant output is currently not subject to cost-based rate recovery and is being sold into the wholesale market.  Approximately 80% of the Turk Plant investment is recovered under cost-based rate recovery in Texas, Louisiana and through SWEPCo s wholesale customers under FERC-based rates.  As of   December 31, 2017  , the net book value of Turk Plant was $1.5 billion, before cost of removal, including materials and supplies inventory and CWIP.  In January 2018, SWEPCo and the LPSC staff agreed on settlement terms relating to the prudence review of the Turk Plant.  See  Louisiana Turk Plant Prudence Review  section of Note   4  .   If SWEPCo cannot ultimately recover its investment and expenses related to the Turk Plant, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Louisiana Turk Plant Prudence Review 
    
  Beginning January 2013, SWEPCo s formula rates, including the Louisiana jurisdictional share (approximately 33%) of the Turk Plant, have been collected subject to refund pending the outcome of a prudence review of the Turk Plant investment, which was placed into service in December 2012.  In October 2017, the LPSC staff filed testimony contending that SWEPCo failed to continue to evaluate the suspension or cancellation of the Turk Plant during its construction period.  In January 2018, SWEPCo and the LPSC staff filed a settlement, subject to LPSC approval, providing for a $19 million pretax write-off of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of previously capitalized Turk Plant costs and a $10 million rate refund provision for previously collected revenues associated with the disallowed portion of the Turk Plant.  Based on the agreement, management concluded that the disallowance was probable resulting in a $23 million pretax write off in the fourth quarter, consisting of a $15 million pretax impairment and an $8 million pretax provision for revenue refund.  The agreement requires $2 million of the provision to be refunded to customers in the first billing cycle following LPSC approval of the settlement and the remaining $8 million to be amortized as a cost of service reduction for customers over 5 years, effective August 1, 2018.  In February 2018, the LPSC approved the settlement agreement. 
    
  2017 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing 
    
  In April 2017, the LPSC approved an uncontested stipulation agreement that SWEPCo filed for its formula rate plan for test year 2015.  The filing included a net annual increase not to exceed   $31 million  , which was effective May 2017 and includes SWEPCo s Louisiana jurisdictional share of Welsh Plant and Flint Creek Plant environmental controls which were placed in service in 2016.  The net annual increase is subject to refund.  In October 2017, SWEPCo filed testimony in Louisiana supporting the prudence of its environmental control investment for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 and Flint Creek power plants.  These environmental costs are subject to prudence review.  A hearing at the LPSC is scheduled for May 2018.  If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

2017 Oklahoma Base Rate Case 
    
  In June 2017, PSO filed an application for a base rate review with the OCC that requested an increase in annual revenues of $156 million, less an $11 million refund obligation, for a net increase of $145 million based upon a proposed 10% return on common equity.  The proposed base rate increase includes (a) environmental compliance investments, including recovery of previously deferred environmental compliance related costs currently recorded as regulatory assets, (b) Advanced Metering Infrastructure investments, (c) additional capital investments and costs to serve PSO s customers, and (d) an annual $42 million depreciation rate increase due primarily to shorter service lives and lower net salvage estimates.  As part of this filing, consistent with the OCC s final order in its previous base rate case, PSO requested recovery through 2040 of Northeastern Plant, Unit 3, including the environmental control investment, and the net book value of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4 that was retired in 2016.  As of December 31, 2017, the net book value of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4 was $81 million. 
    
  In January 2018, the OCC issued a final order approving a net increase in Oklahoma annual revenues of   $84 million  , which was then reduced by   $32 million   to   $52 million   to account for changes as a result of Tax Reform, based upon a return on common equity of   9.3%  .  The final order also included approval for recovery, with a debt return for investors, of the net book value of Northeastern Plant Unit 4 and an annual depreciation expense increase of   $19 million  , including requested recovery through 2040 of Northeastern Plant Unit 3.  PSO anticipates implementing new rates in March 2018 billings. 
    
  2017 Kentucky Base Rate Case 
    
  In June 2017, KPCo filed a request with the KPSC for a $66 million annual increase in Kentucky base rates based upon a proposed 10.31% return on common equity with the increase to be implemented no later than January 2018.  The proposed increase included: (a) lost load since KPCo last changed base rates in July 2015, (b) incremental costs related to OATT charges from PJM not currently recovered from retail ratepayers, (c) increased depreciation expense including updated Big Sandy Plant, Unit 1 depreciation rates using a proposed retirement date of 2031, (d) recovery of other Big Sandy Plant, Unit 1 generation costs currently recovered through a retail rider and (e) incremental purchased power costs.  Additionally, KPCo requested a $4 million annual increase in environmental surcharge revenues.  In August 2017, KPCo submitted a supplemental filing with the KPSC that decreased the proposed annual base rate revenue request to $60 million.  The modification was due to lower interest expense related to June 2017 debt refinancings.   
    
  In November 2017, KPCo filed a non-unanimous settlement agreement with the KPSC.  The settlement agreement included a proposed annual base rate increase of $32 million based upon a 9.75% return on common equity.  
    
  In January 2018, the KPSC issued an order approving the non-unanimous settlement agreement with certain modifications resulting in an annual revenue increase of $12 million, effective January 2018, based on a 9.7% ROE.  The KPSC s primary revenue requirement modification to the settlement agreement was a $14 million annual revenue reduction for the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate due to Tax Reform.  The KPSC approved: (a) the deferral of $50 million of Rockport Plant Unit Power Agreement expenses for the years 2018 through 2022, with recovery of the deferral to be addressed in KPCo s next base rate case, (b) the recovery/return of 80% of certain annual PJM OATT expenses above/below the corresponding level recovered in base rates, (c) KPCo s commitment to not file a base rate case for three years and (d) increased depreciation expense based upon updated Big Sandy Plant, Unit 1 depreciation rates using a 20-year depreciable life. 
    
  In February 2018, KPCo filed with the KPSC for rehearing of the January 2018 base case order and requested an additional $2.3 million of annual revenue increases related to: (a) the calculation of federal income tax expense, (b) recovery of purchased power costs associated with forced outages and (c) capital structure adjustments.  Also in February 2018, an intervenor filed for rehearing recommending that the reduced corporate federal income tax rate, as a result of Tax Reform, be reflected in lower purchased power expense related to the Rockport UPA.  It is anticipated that the KPSC will rule upon this rehearing request in the first quarter of 2018.

2016 Texas Base Rate Case 
    
  In December 2016, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a net increase in Texas annual revenues of $69 million based upon a 10% return on common equity.   In January 2018, the PUCT issued a final order approving a net increase in Texas annual revenues of $50 million based upon a return on common equity of 9.6%, effective May 2017.  The final order also included (a) approval to recover the Texas jurisdictional share of environmental investments placed in service, as of June 30, 2016, at various plants, including Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3, (b) approval of recovery of, but no return on, the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, (c) approval of $2 million additional vegetation management expenses and (d) the rejection of SWEPCo s proposed transmission cost recovery mechanism.   
    
  As a result of the final order, in the fourth quarter, SWEPCo (a) recorded an impairment charge of $19 million, which includes $7 million associated with the lack of return on Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and $12 million related to other disallowed plant investments (b) recognized $32 million of additional revenues, for the period of May 2017 through December 2017, that will be surcharged to customers     and (c) recognized an additional $7 million of expenses consisting primarily of depreciation expense and vegetation management expense, offset by the deferral of rate case expenses.  SWEPCo implemented new rates in February 2018 billings.  The $32 million of additional 2017 revenues will be collected by the end of 2018.  In addition, SWEPCo is required to file a refund tariff within 120 days to reflect the difference between rates collected under the final order and the rates that would be collected under Tax Reform. 
    
  Virginia Legislation Affecting Biennial Reviews 
    
  In 2015, amendments to Virginia law governing the regulation of investor-owned electric utilities were enacted.  Under the amended Virginia law, APCo s existing generation and distribution base rates are frozen until after the Virginia SCC rules on APCo s next biennial review, which APCo will file in March 2020 for the 2018 and 2019 test years.  These amendments also precluded the Virginia SCC from performing biennial reviews of APCo s earnings for the years 2014 through 2017. 
    
  In February 2018, legislation separately passed the Virginia House of Delegates and the Senate of Virginia and, if enacted and signed into law by the Governor in its present form, will: (a) require APCo to not recover   $10 million   of fuel expenses incurred after July 1, 2018, (b) reduce APCo s base rates by   $50 million   annually, on an interim basis and subject to true-up, effective July 30, 2018 related to Tax Reform and (c) require an adjustment in APCo s base rates on April 1, 2019 to reflect actual annual reductions in corporate income taxes due to Tax Reform.  APCo s next base rate review in 2020 will now include a review of earnings for test years 2017-2019, with triennial reviews of APCo s base rates and earnings thereafter instead of biennial reviews.  The current VA legislative session is scheduled to adjourn in March 2018.  Either a biennial review of 2018-2019 or a triennial review of 2017-2019 could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  
    
  FERC Transmission Complaint - AEP s PJM Participants  
    
  In October 2016, several parties filed a complaint at the FERC that states the base return on common equity used by AEP s eastern transmission subsidiaries in calculating formula transmission rates under the PJM OATT is excessive and should be reduced from 10.99% to 8.32%, effective upon the date of the complaint.  Management believes its financial statements adequately address the impact of the complaint.  In November 2017, a FERC Order set the matter for hearing and settlement procedures.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint, including refunds from the date of the complaint filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Modifications to AEP s PJM Transmission Rates 
    
  In November 2016, AEP s eastern transmission subsidiaries filed an application at the FERC to modify the PJM OATT formula transmission rate calculation, including an adjustment to recover a tax-related regulatory asset and a shift from historical to projected expenses.  In March 2017, the FERC accepted the proposed modifications effective January 1, 2017, subject to refund, and set this matter for hearing and settlement procedures.  The modified PJM OATT formula rates are based on projected calendar year financial activity and projected plant balances.  In December 2017, AEP s  
  
   11 

eastern transmission subsidiaries filed an uncontested settlement agreement with the FERC resolving all outstanding issues.  If the FERC determines that any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  FERC Transmission Complaint - AEP s SPP Participants 
    
  In June 2017, several parties filed a complaint at the FERC that states the base return on common equity used by AEP s western transmission subsidiaries in calculating formula transmission rates under the SPP OATT is excessive and should be reduced from 10.7% to 8.36%, effective upon the date of the complaint.  In November 2017, a FERC order set the matter for hearing and settlement procedures.  Management believes its financial statements adequately address the impact of the complaint.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint, including refunds from the date of the complaint filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  
    
  Modifications to AEP s SPP Transmission Rates  
    
  In October 2017, AEP s western transmission subsidiaries filed an application at the FERC to modify the SPP OATT formula transmission rate calculation, including an adjustment to recover a tax-related regulatory asset and a shift from historical to projected expenses.  The modified SPP OATT formula rates are based on projected 2018 calendar year financial activity and projected plant balances.  In December 2017, the FERC accepted the proposed modifications effective January 1, 2018, subject to refund, and set this matter for hearing and settlement procedures.  If the FERC determines that any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  FERC SWEPCo Power Supply Agreements Complaint - East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ETEC) and Northeast Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. (NTEC) 
    
  In September 2017, ETEC and NTEC filed a complaint at the FERC that states the base return on common equity used by SWEPCo in calculating their power supply formula rates is excessive and should be reduced from 11.1% to 8.41%, effective upon the date of the complaint.  In November 2017, a FERC order set the matter for hearing and settlement procedures.  Management believes its financial statements adequately address the impact of the complaint.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint, including refunds from the date of the complaint filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  
    
  Welsh Plant - Environmental Impact 
    
  Management currently estimates that the investment necessary to meet proposed environmental regulations through 2025 for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 could total approximately $850 million, excluding AFUDC.  As of December 31, 2017, SWEPCo had incurred costs of $398 million, including AFUDC, related to these projects.  Management continues to evaluate the impact of environmental rules and related project cost estimates.  As of December 31, 2017, the total net book value of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 was $627 million, before cost of removal, including materials and supplies inventory and CWIP.   
    
  In 2016, as approved by the APSC, SWEPCo began recovering $79 million related to the Arkansas jurisdictional share of these environmental costs, subject to prudence review in the next Arkansas filed base rate proceeding.  In April 2017, the LPSC approved recovery of $131 million in investments related to its Louisiana jurisdictional share of environmental controls installed at Welsh Plant, effective May 2017.  SWEPCo s approved Louisiana jurisdictional share of Welsh Plant deferrals: (a) are $11 million, excluding $6 million of unrecognized equity as of December 31, 2017, (b) is subject to review by the LPSC, and (c) includes a WACC return on environmental investments and the related depreciation expense and taxes.  In January 2018, SWEPCo received written approval from the PUCT to recover its project costs from retail customers in its 2016 Texas base rate case and is recovering these costs from wholesale customers through SWEPCo s FERC-approved agreements.  See  2016 Texas Base Rate Case  and  2017 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing  disclosures above. 
    
  If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  See  Welsh Plant - Environmental Impact  section of Note   4   for additional information.

Westinghouse Electric Company Bankruptcy Filing 
    
  In March 2017, Westinghouse filed a petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  It intends to reorganize, not cease business operations.  However, it is in the early stages of the bankruptcy process and it is unclear whether the company can successfully reorganize.  Westinghouse and I M have a number of significant ongoing contracts relating to reactor services, nuclear fuel fabrication and ongoing engineering projects.  The most significant of these relate to Cook Plant fuel fabrication.  Westinghouse has stated that it intends to continue performance on I M s contracts, but given the importance of upcoming dates in the fuel fabrication process for Cook Plant, and their vital part in Cook Plant s ongoing operations, I M continues to work with Westinghouse in the bankruptcy proceedings to avoid any interruptions to that service. 
    
  In January 2018, Westinghouse issued a news release stating that it intends to sell all of its global business, including the portion of the nuclear business that contracts with Cook Plant.  Any sale would require approval by the bankruptcy court.  In the unlikely event Westinghouse rejects I M s contracts, or there is an interference with the sale process, Cook Plant s operations would be significantly impacted and potentially shut down temporarily as I M seeks other vendors for these services. 
    
  LITIGATION 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, AEP is involved in employment, commercial, environmental and regulatory litigation.  Since it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, management cannot predict the eventual resolution, timing or amount of any loss, fine or penalty.  Management assesses the probability of loss for each contingency and accrues a liability for cases that have a probable likelihood of loss if the loss can be estimated.  For details on the regulatory proceedings and pending litigation see Note   4     Rate Matters and Note   6     Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.  Adverse results in these proceedings have the potential to reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Rockport Plant Litigation 
    
  In July 2013, the Wilmington Trust Company filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AEGCo and I M alleging that it will be unlawfully burdened by the terms of the modified NSR consent decree after the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease expiration in December 2022.  The terms of the consent decree allow the installation of environmental emission control equipment, repowering or retirement of the unit.  The plaintiffs further allege that the defendants  actions constitute breach of the lease and participation agreement.  The plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring that the defendants breached the lease, must satisfy obligations related to installation of emission control equipment and indemnify the plaintiffs.  The New York court granted a motion to transfer this case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  In October 2013, a motion to dismiss the case was filed on behalf of AEGCo and I M. 
    
  In January 2015, the court issued an opinion and order granting the motion in part and denying the motion in part.  The court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs  claims, including the dismissal without prejudice of plaintiffs  claims seeking compensatory damages.  Several claims remained, including the claim for breach of the participation agreement and a claim alleging breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  In June 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion for partial judgment on the claims seeking dismissal of the breach of participation agreement claim as well as any claim for indemnification of costs associated with this case.  The plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint to add another claim under the lease and also filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  In November 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion to strike the plaintiffs  motion for partial judgment and filed a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. 
    
  In March 2016, the court entered an opinion and order in favor of AEGCo and I M, dismissing certain of the plaintiffs  claims for breach of contract and dismissing claims for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and further dismissing plaintiffs  claim for indemnification of costs.  By the same order, the court permitted plaintiffs to move forward with their claim that AEGCo and I M failed to exercise prudent utility practices in the maintenance and operation of Rockport Plant, Unit 2.  In April 2016, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of all remaining  
  
   13 

claims with prejudice and the court subsequently entered a final judgment.  In May 2016, plaintiffs filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on whether AEGCo and I M are in breach of certain contract provisions that plaintiffs allege operate to protect the plaintiffs  residual interests in the unit and whether the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs  claims that AEGCo and I M breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
    
  In April 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court s decisions which had dismissed certain of plaintiffs  claims for breach of contract and remanding the case to the district court to enter summary judgment in plaintiffs  favor consistent with that ruling.  In April 2017, AEGCo and I M filed a petition for rehearing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which was granted.  In June 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an amended opinion and judgment which reverses the district court s dismissal of certain of the owners  claims under the lease agreements, vacates the denial of the owners  motion for partial summary judgment and remands the case to the district court for further proceedings.  The amended opinion and judgment also affirms the district court s dismissal of the owners  breach of good faith and fair dealing claim as duplicative of the breach of contract claims and removes the instruction to the district court in the original opinion to enter summary judgment in favor of the owners. 
    
  In July 2017, AEP filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in the original NSR litigation, seeking to modify the consent decree to eliminate the obligation to install certain future controls at Rockport Plant, Unit 2 if AEP does not acquire ownership of that Unit, and to modify the consent decree in other respects to preserve the environmental benefits of the consent decree.  In November 2017, the district court granted the owners  unopposed motion to stay the lease litigation to afford time for resolution of AEP s motion to modify the consent decree. See  Proposed Modification of the NSR Litigation Consent Decree  section below for additional information. 
    
  Management will continue to defend against the claims.  Given that the district court dismissed plaintiffs  claims seeking compensatory relief as premature, and that plaintiffs have yet to present a methodology for determining or any analysis supporting any alleged damages, management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring. 
    
  ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
    
  AEP has a substantial capital investment program and is incurring additional operational costs to comply with environmental control requirements.  Additional investments and operational changes will need to be made in response to existing and anticipated requirements such as new CAA requirements to reduce emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, rules governing the beneficial use and disposal of coal combustion by-products, clean water rules and renewal permits for certain water discharges. 
    
  AEP is engaged in litigation about environmental issues, was notified of potential responsibility for the clean-up of contaminated sites and incurred costs for disposal of SNF and future decommissioning of the nuclear units.  AEP, along with various industry groups, affected states and other parties challenged some of the Federal EPA requirements in court.  Management is also engaged in the development of possible future requirements including the items discussed below.  Management believes that further analysis and better coordination of these environmental requirements would facilitate planning and lower overall compliance costs while achieving the same environmental goals. 
    
  AEP will seek recovery of expenditures for pollution control technologies and associated costs from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Environmental rules could result in accelerated depreciation, impairment of assets or regulatory disallowances.  If AEP is unable to recover the costs of environmental compliance, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

Environmental Controls Impact on the Generating Fleet 
    
  The rules and proposed environmental controls discussed below will have a material impact on the generating units in the AEP System.  Management continues to evaluate the impact of these rules, project scope and technology available to achieve compliance.  As of   December 31, 2017  , the AEP System had a total generating capacity of approximately 25,600 MWs, of which approximately 13,500 MWs are coal-fired.  Management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with these rules and other impacts of the environmental proposals on the fossil generating facilities.  Based upon management estimates, AEP s investment to meet these existing and proposed requirements ranges from approximately $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion through 2025. 
    
  The cost estimates will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in finalizing proposed rules or revising certain existing requirements.  The cost estimates will also change based on: (a) the states  implementation of these regulatory programs, including the potential for state implementation plans (SIPs) or federal implementation plans (FIPs) that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired and replaced, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and (g) other factors.  In addition, management is continuing to evaluate the economic feasibility of environmental investments on both regulated and competitive plants. 
    
  The table below represents the plants or units of plants retired in 2016 and 2015 with a remaining net book value.  As of   December 31, 2017  , the net book value before cost of removal, including related materials and supplies inventory and CWIP balances, of the units listed below was approved for recovery, except for $233 million.  Management is seeking or will seek recovery of the remaining net book value of $233 million in future rate proceedings. 

(a) 
    APCo obtained permits following the Virginia SCC s and WVPSC s approval to convert its 470 MW Clinch River Plant, Units 1 and 2 to natural gas.  In 2015, APCo retired the coal-related assets of Clinch River Plant, Units 1 and 2.  Clinch River Plant, Unit 1 and Unit 2 began operations as natural gas units in February 2016 and April 2016, respectively. 
              (b) 
    I M requested recovery of the Indiana (approximately 65%) and Michigan (approximately 14%) jurisdictional shares of the remaining retirement costs of Tanners Creek Plant in the 2017 Indiana and Michigan base rate cases.  See  2017 Indiana Base Rate Case  and  2017 Michigan Base Rate Case  sections of Note   4   for additional information. 
       
  In January 2017, Dayton Power and Light Company announced the future retirement of the 2,308 MW Stuart Plant, Units 1-4.  The retirement is scheduled for June 2018.  Stuart Plant, Units 1-4 are operated by Dayton Power and Light Company and are jointly owned by AGR and nonaffiliated entities.  AGR owns 600 MWs of the Stuart Plant, Units 1-4.  As of   December 31, 2017  , AGR s net book value of the Stuart Plant, Units 1-4 was zero. 
    
  To the extent existing generation assets are not recoverable, it could materially reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

Proposed Modification of the NSR Litigation Consent Decree 
    
  In 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio approved a consent decree between the AEP subsidiaries in the eastern area of the AEP System and the Department of Justice, the Federal EPA, eight northeastern states and other interested parties to settle claims that the AEP subsidiaries violated the NSR provisions of the CAA when they undertook various equipment repair and replacement projects over a period of nearly 20 years.  The consent decree s terms include installation of environmental control equipment on certain generating units, a declining cap on SO   2    and NO   x    emissions from the AEP System and various mitigation projects. 
    
  In July 2017, AEP filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio seeking to modify the consent decree to eliminate an obligation to install future controls at Rockport Plant, Unit 2 if AEP does not acquire ownership of that unit, and to modify the consent decree in other respects to preserve the environmental benefits of the consent decree.  The district court granted AEP s request to delay the deadline to install SCR technology at Rockport Plant, Unit 2 until June 2020, pending resolution of the motion.  AEP also proposed to retire Conesville Plant, Units 5 and 6 by December 31, 2022 and to retire one Rockport Plant unit by December 31, 2028.  Plaintiffs opposed AEP s motion.   
    
  In January 2018, AEP filed a supplemental motion proposing to install the SCR at Rockport Plant, Unit 2 and achieve the final SO   2    emission cap applicable to the plant under the consent decree by the end of 2020, before the expiration of the initial lease term.  Responsive filings were filed in February 2018 and a decision is anticipated in the first quarter of 2018. 
    
  AEP is seeking to modify the consent decree as a means to resolve or substantially narrow the issues in pending litigation with the owners of Rockport Plant, Unit 2.  See  Rockport Plant Litigation  in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note   6   - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies for additional information. 
    
  Clean Air Act Requirements 
    
  The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation s air quality and control sources of air emissions.  The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements.  The primary regulatory programs that continue to drive investments in AEP s existing generating units include: (a) periodic revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the development of SIPs to achieve any more stringent standards; (b) implementation of the regional haze program by the states and the Federal EPA; (c) regulation of hazardous air pollutant emissions under the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) Rule; (d) implementation and review of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), a FIP designed to eliminate significant contributions from sources in upwind states to nonattainment or maintenance areas in downwind states and (e) the Federal EPA s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil-fueled electric generating units under Section 111 of the CAA. 
    
  In March 2017, President Trump issued a series of executive orders designed to allow the Federal EPA to review and take appropriate action to revise or rescind regulatory requirements that place undue burdens on affected entities, including specific orders directing the Federal EPA to review rules that unnecessarily burden the production and use of energy.  The Federal EPA published notice and an opportunity to comment on how to identify such requirements and what steps can be taken to reduce or eliminate such burdens.  Future changes that result from this effort may affect AEP s compliance plans. 
    
  Notable developments in significant CAA regulatory requirements affecting AEP s operations are discussed in the following sections. 

16 

NAAQS 
    
  The Federal EPA issued new, more stringent NAAQS for SO   2    in 2010, PM in 2012 and ozone in 2015.  Implementation of these standards is underway.  States are still in the process of evaluating the attainment status and need for additional control measures in order to attain and maintain the 2010 SO   2    NAAQS.  In December 2017, the Federal EPA published final designations for certain areas  compliance with the 2010 SO   2    NAAQS.  States may develop additional requirements for AEP s facilities as a result of these designations.  In April 2017, the Federal EPA requested a stay of proceedings in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit where challenges to the 2015 ozone standard are pending, to allow reconsideration of that standard by the new administration.  The Federal EPA initially announced a one-year delay in the designation of ozone non-attainment areas, but withdrew that decision.  In December 2017, the Federal EPA issued a notice of data availability and requested public comment on recommended designations for compliance with the 2015 ozone standard.  Management cannot currently predict the nature, stringency or timing of additional requirements for AEP s facilities based on the outcome of these activities. 
    
  Regional Haze 
    
  The Federal EPA issued a Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), detailing how the CAA s requirement that certain facilities install best available retrofit technology (BART) will address regional haze in federal parks and other protected areas.  BART requirements apply to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power plants.  CAVR will be implemented through SIPs or, if SIPs are not adequate or are not developed on schedule, through FIPs.  In January 2017, the Federal EPA revised the rules governing submission of SIPs to implement the visibility programs, including a provision that postpones the due date for the next comprehensive SIP revisions until 2021.  Petitions for review of the final rule revisions have been filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  
    
  The Federal EPA proposed disapproval of regional haze SIPs in a few states, including Arkansas and Texas.  In March 2012, the Federal EPA disapproved certain portions of the Arkansas regional haze SIP.  In April 2015, the Federal EPA published a proposed FIP to replace the disapproved portions, including revised BART determinations for the Flint Creek Plant that were consistent with the environmental controls currently under construction.  In September 2016, the Federal EPA published a final FIP that retains its BART determinations, but accelerates the schedule for implementation of certain required controls.  The final rule is being challenged in the courts.  In March 2017, the Federal EPA filed a motion that was granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to hold the case in abeyance for 90 days to allow the parties to engage in settlement negotiations.  Arkansas issued a proposed SIP revision to allow sources to participate in the CSAPR ozone season program in lieu of the source-specific NO   x    BART requirements in the FIP, and the Federal EPA has proposed to approve that SIP revision.  Arkansas issued a second proposal to revise the SO   2    BART determinations, and that proposal is open for public comment.  The Federal EPA has asked the Eighth Circuit to continue to hold litigation in abeyance to facilitate settlement discussions.  Arkansas and other affected parties have filed motions to stay the compliance deadlines pending further action from the Federal EPA.  Management cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. 
    
  In January 2016, the Federal EPA disapproved portions of the Texas regional haze SIP and promulgated a final FIP that did not include any BART determinations.  That rule was challenged and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  The parties engaged in a settlement discussion but were unable to reach an agreement.  In March 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted partial remand of the final rule.  In January 2017, the Federal EPA proposed source-specific BART requirements for SO   2    from sources in Texas, including Welsh Plant, Unit 1.  Management submitted comments on the proposal and is engaged in discussions with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) regarding the development of an alternative to source-specific BART.  In September 2017, the Federal EPA issued a final rule withdrawing Texas from the annual CSAPR budget programs.  The Federal EPA then issued a separate rule finalizing the regional haze requirements for electric generating units in Texas and confirmed TCEQ s determination that no new PM limitations are required for regional haze.  The Federal EPA also finalized a FIP that allows participation in the CSAPR ozone season program to satisfy the NO   x    regional haze obligations for electric generating units.  Additionally, the Federal EPA finalized an intrastate SO   2    emissions trading program based on CSAPR allowance allocations as an alternative to source-specific SO   2    requirements.  The proposed source-specific approach called for a wet FGD system to be installed on Welsh Plant, Unit 1.  The opportunity to use emissions trading  
  
   17 

to satisfy the regional haze requirements for NO   x    and SO   2    at AEP s affected generating units provides greater flexibility and lower cost compliance options than the original proposal.  A challenge to the FIP has been filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit by various intervenors.  Management supports the intrastate trading program contained in the FIP as a compliance alternative to source-specific controls. 
    
  In June 2012, the Federal EPA published revisions to the regional haze rules to allow states participating in the CSAPR trading programs to use those programs in place of source-specific BART for SO   2    and NO   x    emissions based on its determination that CSAPR results in greater visibility improvements than source-specific BART in the CSAPR states.  This rule is being challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  Management supports compliance with CSAPR programs as satisfaction of the BART requirements. 
    
  CSAPR 
    
  In 2011, the Federal EPA issued CSAPR as a replacement for the CAIR, a regional trading program designed to address interstate transport of emissions that contributed significantly to downwind nonattainment with the 1997 ozone and PM NAAQS.  Certain revisions to the rule were finalized in 2012.  CSAPR relies on newly-created SO   2    and NO   x    allowances and individual state budgets to compel further emission reductions from electric utility generating units.  Interstate trading of allowances is allowed on a restricted sub-regional basis.   
    
  Numerous affected entities, states and other parties filed petitions to review the CSAPR in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  The court stayed implementation of the rule.  Following extended proceedings in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, but while the litigation was still pending, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the Federal EPA s motion to lift the stay and allow Phase I of CSAPR to take effect on January 1, 2015 and Phase II to take effect on January 1, 2017.  In July 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that the Federal EPA over-controlled the SO   2    and/or NO   x    budgets of 14 states.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the rule to the Federal EPA to timely revise the rule consistent with the court s opinion while CSAPR remains in place.  
    
  In October 2016, a final rule was issued to address the remand and to incorporate additional changes necessary to address the 2008 ozone standard.  The final rule significantly reduces ozone season budgets in many states and discounts the value of banked CSAPR ozone season allowances beginning with the 2017 ozone season.  The rule has been challenged in the courts and petitions for administrative reconsideration have been filed.  The rule remains in effect.  Management is complying with the more stringent ozone season budgets while these petitions are being considered.  
    
  Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) Regulation 
    
  In 2012, the Federal EPA issued a rule addressing a broad range of HAPs from coal and oil-fired power plants.  The rule establishes unit-specific emission rates for units burning coal on a 30-day rolling average basis for mercury, PM (as a surrogate for particles of nonmercury metals) and hydrogen chloride (as a surrogate for acid gases).  In addition, the rule proposes work practice standards, such as boiler tune-ups, for controlling emissions of organic HAPs and dioxin/furans.  Compliance was required within three years.  Management obtained administrative extensions for up to one year at several units to facilitate the installation of controls or to avoid a serious reliability problem.  
    
  In April 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied all of the petitions for review of the April 2012 final rule.  Industry trade groups and several states filed petitions for further review in the U.S. Supreme Court and the court granted those petitions in November 2014.  
    
  In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the MATS rule for further proceedings consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court s decision that the Federal EPA was unreasonable in refusing to consider costs in its determination whether to regulate emissions of HAPs from power plants.  The Federal EPA issued notice of a supplemental finding concluding that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate HAP emissions from coal-fired and oil-fired units.  Management submitted comments on the proposal.  In April 2016, the Federal EPA affirmed its determination that regulation of HAPs from electric generating units is necessary and appropriate.

of the Federal EPA s April 2016 determination have been filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  Oral argument was scheduled for May 2017, but in April 2017 the Federal EPA requested that oral argument be postponed to facilitate its review of the rule.  The rule remains in effect.  
    
  Climate Change, CO   2    Regulation and Energy Policy 
    
  The majority of the states where AEP has generating facilities passed legislation establishing renewable energy, alternative energy and/or energy efficiency requirements that can assist in reducing carbon emissions.  Management is taking steps to comply with these requirements, including increasing wind and solar installations and power purchases and broadening the AEP System s portfolio of energy efficiency programs.   
    
  In October 2015, the Federal EPA published the final standards for new, modified and reconstructed fossil fuel fired steam generating units and combustion turbines, and final guidelines for the development of state plans to regulate CO   2    emissions from existing sources.  The final standard for new combustion turbines is 1,000 pounds of CO   2    per MWh and the final standard for new fossil steam units is 1,400 pounds of CO   2    per MWh.  Reconstructed turbines are subject to the same standard as new units and no standard for modified combustion turbines was issued.  Reconstructed fossil steam units are subject to a standard of 1,800 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for larger units and 2,000 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for smaller units.  Modified fossil steam units will be subject to a site specific standard no lower than the standards that would be applied if the units were reconstructed.  
    
  The final emissions guidelines for existing sources, known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), are based on a series of declining emission rates that are implemented beginning in 2022 through 2029.  The final emission rate is 771 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for existing natural gas combined cycle units and 1,305 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for existing fossil steam units in 2030 and thereafter.  The Federal EPA also developed a set of rate-based and mass-based state goals. 
    
  The Federal EPA also published proposed  model  rules that could be adopted by the states that would allow sources within  trading ready  state programs to trade, bank or sell allowances or credits issued by the states.  These rules would also be the basis for any federal plan issued by the Federal EPA in a state that fails to submit or receive approval for a state plan.  In June 2016, the Federal EPA issued a separate proposal for the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP) that was included in the model rules.  
    
  The final rules are being challenged in the courts.  In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on the final CPP, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans.  The stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court considers any petition for review.  In April 2017, the Federal EPA withdrew its previously issued proposals for model trading rules and a CEIP. 
    
  In March 2017, the Federal EPA filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit notice of: (a) an Executive Order from the President of the United States titled  Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth  directing the Federal EPA to review the CPP and related rules; (b) the Federal EPA s initiation of a review of the CPP and (c) a forthcoming rulemaking related to the CPP consistent with the Executive Order, if the Federal EPA determines appropriate.  In this same filing, the Federal EPA also presented a motion to hold the litigation in abeyance until 30 days after the conclusion of review of any resulting rulemaking.  The District of Columbia Circuit granted the Federal EPA s motion in part and has requested periodic status reports.  In October 2017, the Federal EPA issued a proposed rule repealing the CPP and withdrawing the legal memoranda issued in connection with the rule.  The Federal EPA has re-examined its legal interpretation of the  best system of emission reduction  and found that based on the statutory text, legislative history, use of similar terms elsewhere in the CAA and its own historic implementation of Section 111 that a narrower interpretation of the term limits it to those designs, processes, control technologies and other systems that can be applied directly to or at the source.  Since the primary systems relied on in the CPP are not consistent with that interpretation, the Federal EPA proposes that the rule be withdrawn.  The comment period on the proposed repeal has been extended to April 2018.  In December 2017, the Federal EPA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking information that should be considered by the Federal EPA in developing guidelines for state programs.  Management anticipates providing information in response to this notice, and actively participating in the development of any new guidelines.

AEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO   2    emissions from its generating fleet and expects CO   2    emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coal-fired generation units, and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities.  In February 2018, AEP announced new intermediate and long-term CO   2    emission reduction goals, based on the output of the company s integrated resource plans, which take into account economics, customer demand, regulations, and grid reliability and resiliency, and reflect the company s current business strategy.  The intermediate goal is a 60 percent reduction from 2000 CO   2    emission levels from AEP generating facilities by 2030; the long-term goal is an 80 percent reduction of CO   2    emissions from AEP generating facilities from 2000 levels by 2050.  AEP s total projected CO   2    emissions in   2018   are approximately 90 million metric tons, a 46% reduction from AEP s 2000 CO   2    emissions of approximately 167 million metric tons. 
    
  Federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of CO   2    could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, which in turn, could lead to increased liquidity needs and higher financing costs.  Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force AEP to close some coal-fired facilities and could lead to possible impairment of assets. 
    
  Coal Combustion Residual Rule 
    
  In April 2015, the Federal EPA published a final rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals (CCR), including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired electric generating units and also FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants.  The final rule has been challenged in the courts. 
    
  The final rule became effective in October 2015.  The Federal EPA regulates CCR as a non-hazardous solid waste by its issuance of new minimum federal solid waste management standards.  The rule applies to new and existing active CCR landfills and CCR surface impoundments at operating electric utility or independent power production facilities.  The rule imposes new and additional construction and operating obligations, including location restrictions, liner criteria, structural integrity requirements for impoundments, operating criteria and additional groundwater monitoring requirements to be implemented on a schedule spanning an approximate four year implementation period.  
    
  In December 2016, the U.S. Congress passed legislation authorizing states to submit programs to regulate CCR facilities, and the Federal EPA to approve such programs if they are no less stringent than the minimum federal standards.  The Federal EPA may also enforce compliance with the minimum standards until a state program is approved or if states fail to adopt their own programs.  In September 2017, the Federal EPA granted industry petitions to reconsider the CCR rule and asked that litigation regarding the rule be held in abeyance.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard oral argument in November 2017. 
    
  Because AEP currently uses surface impoundments and landfills to manage CCR materials at generating facilities, significant costs will be incurred to upgrade or close and replace these existing facilities at some point in the future as the new rule is implemented.  Management recorded a $95 million increase in asset retirement obligations in 2015 primarily due to the publication of the final rule.  Management will continue to evaluate the rule s impact on operations. 
    
  Clean Water Act (CWA) Regulations 
    
  In 2014, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant s cooling water intake screen (impingement) or entrained in the cooling water.  Entrainment is when small fish, eggs or larvae are drawn into the cooling water system and affected by heat, chemicals or physical stress.  The final rule affects all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day.  The rule offers seven technology options to comply with the impingement standard and requires site-specific studies to determine appropriate entrainment compliance measures at facilities withdrawing more than 125 million gallons per day.  Additional requirements may be imposed as a result of consultation with other federal agencies to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats.  Facilities with existing closed cycle recirculating cooling systems, as defined in the rule, are not expected to require any technology changes.  Facilities subject to both the impingement standard and site-specific entrainment studies will typically be given at least three  
  
   20 

years to conduct and submit the results of those studies to the permit agency.  Compliance timeframes will then be established by the permit agency through each facility s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for installation of any required technology changes, as those permits are renewed over the next five to eight years.  Petitions for review of the final rule were filed by industry and environmental groups and are currently pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  
    
  In addition, the Federal EPA developed revised effluent limitation guidelines for electricity generating facilities.  A final rule was issued in November 2015.  The final rule establishes limits on FGD wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater to be imposed as soon as possible after November 2018 and no later than December 2023.  These new requirements will be implemented through each facility s wastewater discharge permit.  The rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  In March 2017, industry associations filed a petition for reconsideration of the rule with the Federal EPA.  In April 2017, the Federal EPA granted reconsideration of the rule and issued a stay of the rule s future compliance deadlines, which has now expired.  In April 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted a stay of the litigation for 120 days.  In June 2017, the Federal EPA also issued a proposal to temporarily postpone certain compliance deadlines in the rule.  A final rule revising the compliance deadlines for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water to be no earlier than 2020 was issued in September 2017.  Management submitted comments supporting the proposed postponement.  Management continues to assess technology additions and retrofits to comply with the rule and the impacts of the Federal EPA s recent actions on facilities  wastewater discharge permitting.   
    
  In June 2015, the Federal EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jointly issued a final rule to clarify the scope of the regulatory definition of  waters of the United States  in light of recent U.S. Supreme Court cases.  The CWA provides for federal jurisdiction over  navigable waters  defined as  the waters of the United States.   This jurisdictional definition applies to all CWA programs, potentially impacting generation, transmission and distribution permitting and compliance requirements.  Among those programs are permits for wastewater and storm water discharges, permits for impacts to wetlands and water bodies and oil spill prevention planning.  The final definition continues to recognize traditional navigable waters of the U.S. as jurisdictional as well as certain exclusions.  The rule also contains a number of new specific definitions and criteria for determining whether certain other waters are jurisdictional because of a  significant nexus.   Management believes that clarity and efficiency in the permitting process is needed.  Management remains concerned that the rule introduces new concepts and could subject more of AEP s operations to CWA jurisdiction, thereby increasing the time and complexity of permitting.  The final rule is being challenged in both courts of appeal and district courts.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted a nationwide stay of the rule pending jurisdictional determinations.  In February 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a decision holding that it has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the challenges to the  waters of the United States  rule.  Industry, state and related associations have filed petitions for a rehearing of the jurisdictional decision.  In April 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied the petitions.  In January 2017, the decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to review the jurisdictional issue.  The U.S. Supreme Court denied the Federal EPA s motion to hold briefing in abeyance pending further Federal EPA actions on the rule.  Oral argument was heard in October 2017.  In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that challenges to the definition of  waters of the United States  must be filed in the federal district court, and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit with directions to dismiss the petitions for review for lack of jurisdiction.   
    
  In March 2017, the Federal EPA published a notice of intent to review the rule and provide an advanced notice of a proposed rulemaking consistent with the Executive Order of the President of the United States directing the Federal EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to review and rescind or revise the rule.  In June 2017, the agencies signed a notice of proposed rule to rescind the definition of  waters of the United States  that was adopted in June 2015, and to re-codify the definition of that phrase as it existed immediately prior to that action.  This action would effectively retain the status quo until a new rule is adopted by the agencies.  The Federal EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also accepted written recommendations on a new rule and proposed to extend the applicability date of the rule by two years in the event the nationwide stay issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is lifted.  It is not yet clear what action the agencies will take in response to the Supreme Court decision.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  SEGMENTS 
    
  AEP s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.  Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight.  Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. 
    
  AEP s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below: 
    
  Vertically Integrated Utilities 

Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. 
       
  Transmission and Distribution Utilities 

Transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo. 
                
    OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve SSO customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load. 
       
  AEP Transmission Holdco 

Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEPTCo.  These investments have FERC-approved returns on equity. 
                
    Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEP s transmission-only joint ventures.  These investments have PUCT-approved or FERC-approved returns on equity. 
       
  Generation   Marketing 

Competitive generation in ERCOT and PJM. 
                
    Marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO. 
                
    Contracted renewable energy investments and management services. 
       
  The remainder of AEP s activities is presented as Corporate and Other.  While not considered a reportable segment, Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries, Parent s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income and interest expense and other nonallocated costs.  With the sale of AEPRO in November 2015, the activities related to the AEP River Operations segment have been moved to Corporate and Other for the periods presented.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
    
  The following discussion of AEP s results of operations by operating segment includes an analysis of Gross Margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Gross Margin includes Total Revenues less the costs of Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation as well as Purchased Electricity for Resale, Generation Deferrals and Amortization of Generation Deferrals as presented in the Registrants statements of income as applicable.  Under the various state utility rate making processes, these expenses are generally reimbursable directly from and billed to customers.  As a result, they do not typically impact Operating Income or Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders.  Management believes that Gross Margin provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze AEP s financial performance in that it excludes the effect on Total Revenues caused by volatility in these expenses.  Operating income, which is presented in accordance with GAAP in AEP s statements of income, is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to the presentation of Gross Margin.  AEP s definition of Gross Margin may not be directly comparable to similarly titled financial measures used by other companies.

The table below presents Earnings (Loss) Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders by segment: 

AEP CONSOLIDATED 
    
  2017   Compared to   2016    
    
  Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders increased from $611 million in   2016   to $1.9 billion in   2017   primarily due to: 

An increase due to the impairment of certain merchant generation assets in 2016. 
                
    An increase due to the current year gain on the sale of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    An increase in transmission investment primarily at AEP Transmission Holdco which resulted in higher revenues and income. 
                
    Favorable rate proceedings in AEP s various jurisdictions. 
       
  These increases were partially offset by: 

A decrease in generation revenues associated with the sale of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    A decrease in weather-related usage. 
                
    A decrease in FERC wholesale municipal and cooperative revenues.  
                
    The prior year reversal of income tax expense for an unrealized capital loss valuation allowance.  AEP effectively settled a 2011 audit issue with the IRS resulting in a change in the valuation allowance. 
       
  2016   Compared to   2015    
    
  Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders decreased from $2 billion in   2015   to $611 million in   2016   primarily due to: 

An impairment of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    A decrease in generation revenues due to lower capacity revenue and a decrease in wholesale energy prices. 
       
  These decreases were partially offset by: 

A decrease in system income taxes primarily due to reduced pretax book income as a result of the impairment of certain merchant generation assets as well as the reversal of valuation allowances related to the pending sale of certain merchant generation assets and the settlement of a 2011 audit issue with the IRS, as well as favorable 2015 income tax return adjustments related to AEP s commercial barging operations. 
                
    Favorable rate proceedings during 2016 in AEP s various jurisdictions. 
       
  AEP s results of operations by reportable segment are discussed below.

  (in millions) 

The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $7 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    The effect of rate proceedings in AEP s service territories which include: 
                
    A $74 million increase for SWEPCo primarily due to rider and base rate revenue increases in Texas and Louisiana. 
                
    A $63 million increase for I M from rate proceedings primarily in Indiana. 
                
    A $22 million increase for PSO from base rate increases implemented in 2017 and revenue increases from rate riders. 
                
    A $6 million increase for KGPCo due to revenue increases from rate riders/trackers. 
     For the rate increases described above, $87 million relate to riders/trackers which have corresponding increases in expense items below. 
             
    A $24 million increase primarily due to reduced fuel and other variable production costs not recovered through fuel clauses or other trackers. 
                
    A $9 million increase in weather-normalized margins due to higher residential and industrial sales partially offset by lower commercial sales. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $133 million decrease in weather-related usage in the eastern and western regions. 
                
    A $50 million decrease for I M and SWEPCo in FERC generation wholesale municipal and cooperative revenues primarily due to an annual formula rate true-up and changes to the annual formula rate. 
                
    A $9 million decrease for APCo primarily due to prior year recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia as approved by the WVPSC. 
     
   26 

Margins from Off-system Sales   increased $12 million primarily due to higher market prices and increased sales volume. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   increased $17 million primarily due the following: 
                
    A $43 million increase primarily due to increases in formula rates driven by continued investment in transmission assets.  This increase was partially offset in Expenses and Other items below. 
     This increase was partially offset by: 
             
    A $26 million decrease primarily due to I M s annual formula rate true-up and reduced net PJM Network Integration Transmission Service revenues resulting from increased affiliated transmission-related charges. 
       
  Expenses and Other, Income Tax Expense, Equity Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries and Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $34 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $134 million increase in recoverable expenses, primarily PJM expenses, fuel support and energy efficiency expenses fully recovered in rate recovery riders/trackers within Gross Margin above. 
                
    A $14 million increase due to the Wind Catcher Project for PSO and SWEPCo. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $49 million decrease in employee-related expenses. 
                
    A $36 million decrease in charitable contributions, primarily to the AEP Foundation. 
                
    A $17 million decrease in planned plant outages and maintenance primarily in the western region. 
                
    A $5 million decrease due to an increase in gain on sales of property in 2017. 
                
    A $4 million decrease due to the reduction of an environmental liability at I M. 
                
    Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges   increased $23 million primarily due to the following:  
                
    A $34 million increase at SWEPCo due to asset impairments of Turk Plant and Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and other charges related to the Texas base rate case. 
     This increase was partially offset by: 
             
    An $11 million decrease due to the impairment of I M s Price River Coal reserves in 2016. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses increased $69 million     primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $61 million increase primarily due to higher depreciable base. 
                
    A $22 million increase due to amortization of capitalized software costs. 
                
    Taxes Other Than Income Taxes   increased $23 million primarily due to higher property taxes. 
                
    Carrying Costs Income   increased $5 million primarily due to increased deferred carrying charges at I M for a Cook Life Cycle Management project. 
                
    Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction   decreased $18 million     primarily due to completed environmental projects for I M, PSO and SWEPCo. 
                
    Interest Expense   increased $18 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $10 million increase primarily due to higher long-term debt balances at I M. 
                
    An $8 million increase due to lower AFUDC borrowed funds resulting from reduced CWIP balances. 
                
    Income Tax     Expense   increased $28 million primarily due to the recording of favorable state and federal income tax adjustments in 2016, the recording of federal income tax adjustments related to Tax Reform and other book/tax differences which are accounted for on a flow-through basis, partially offset by a decrease in pretax book income.  
                
    Equity Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries   decreased $12 million primarily due to a prior period income tax adjustment for DHLC, a SWEPCo unconsolidated subsidiary. 
                
    Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests   increased $9 million primarily due to income tax benefits attributable to SWEPCo s noncontrolling interest in Sabine.  This increase was offset by a decrease in Income Tax Expense.

  (in millions) 

The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $275 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    The effect of rate proceedings in AEP s service territories which include: 
                
    A $158 million increase in rates in West Virginia and Virginia, which includes recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia as approved by the WVPSC in June 2016.  This increase was partially offset by a 2015 adjustment affected by the amended Virginia law that has an impact on biennial reviews. 
                
    A $48 million increase for KPCo primarily due to increases in base rates and riders. 
                
    A $41 million increase for I M due to increases in riders in the Indiana service territory. 
                
    A $26 million increase for PSO due to base rate increases implemented in January 2016 and rider revenues. 
                
    A $23 million increase for SWEPCo due to revenue increases from rate riders in Arkansas and Texas. 
     For the increases described above, $177 million relate to riders/trackers which have corresponding increases in expense items below. 
             
    A $29 million increase in weather-related usage primarily in the eastern region. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $22 million decrease in weather-normalized margins primarily in the eastern region.

  (in millions) 

The major components of the decrease in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, purchased electricity and certain cost of service for retail operations were as follows: 

Generation   decreased $505 million primarily due to the reduction of revenues associated with the sale of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    Retail, Trading and Marketing   decreased $49 million primarily due to lower retail margins in 2017 combined with the impact of favorable wholesale trading and marketing performance in 2016. 
                
    Other     Revenue   increased $14 million primarily due to renewable projects placed in service. 

42 

Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense (Credit) changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses decreased $148 million primarily due to decreased plant expenses as a result of the sale of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges   decreased $2.2 billion due to the impairment of certain merchant generation assets in 2016, partially offset by a $43 million impairment of the Racine Hydroelectric Plant in 2017. 
                
    Gain on Sale of Merchant Generation Assets   increased $226 million due to the sale of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses decreased $130 million primarily due to the sale and impairment of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    Taxes Other Than Income Taxes   decreased $26 million primarily due to the sale of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    Interest and Investment Income   increased $9 million primarily due to additional cash invested as a result of the sale of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    Interest Expense   decreased $17 million primarily due to reduced debt as a result of the sale of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    Income Tax Expense (Credit)   increased $856 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income as a result of the impairment of certain merchant generation assets recorded in 2016, a gain on the sale of certain merchant generation assets recorded in 2017 and the recording of federal income tax adjustments related to Tax Reform.

  (in millions) 

The major components of the decrease in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, purchased electricity and certain cost of service for retail operations were as follows: 

Generation   decreased $225 million primarily due to reduced power prices, lower capacity revenues resulting from plant retirements, and the transition of the Ohio SSO to full market pricing, partially offset by favorable hedging activity. 
                
    Retail, Trading and Marketing   increased $18 million primarily due to an increase in retail volumes and increased margins. 
                
    Other     Revenue   decreased $4 million primarily due to unfavorable wind conditions and decreased wholesale energy prices. 
       
  Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense (Credit) changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $10 million primarily due to the 2015 sale of certain assets and revision of the related asset retirement obligations, partially offset by a decrease in maintenance due to plant retirements in June 2015. 
                
    Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges   increased $2.3 billion due to an asset impairment of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   decreased $47 million primarily due to the impairment of certain merchant generation assets, the classification of certain assets as held for sale and plant retirements in June 2015. 
                
    Interest Expense   decreased $4 million primarily due to a decrease in long-term debt outstanding. 
                
    Income Tax Expense (Credit)   decreased $861 million primarily due to reduced pretax book income as a result of the impairment of certain merchant generation assets and by the recording of federal and state income tax adjustments.

CORPORATE AND OTHER 
    
  2017   Compared to   2016    
    
  Earnings attributable to AEP Common Shareholders from Corporate and Other decreased from $81 million in   2016   to a loss of $32 million in   2017   primarily due   to     the prior year reversal of capital loss valuation allowances related to effectively settling a 2011 audit issue with the IRS and the impact of the pending sale of certain merchant generation assets as well as 2015 tax return adjustments related to the disposition of AEP s commercial barging operations.  Earnings attributable to AEP Common Shareholders also decreased due to increased income tax expense in 2017 as a result of   federal income tax adjustments related to Tax Reform.  These decreases were offset by an increase in pretax book income primarily due to lower operating expenses.  
    
  2016   Compared to   2015    
    
  Earnings attributable to AEP Common Shareholders from Corporate and Other decreased from $241 million in 2015 to $81 million in 2016 primarily due   to     the reversal of capital loss valuation allowances related to the settlement of a 2011 audit issue with the IRS and the impact of the pending sale of certain merchant generation assets as well as 2015 tax return adjustments related to the disposition of AEP s commercial barging operations.  This was partially offset by the gain on the sale of AEPRO, charges related to the final accounting of the disposition of AEP s commercial barging operations and decreased income from the discounted operations of AEP s commercial barging operation which was sold in November 2015. 

AEP SYSTEM INCOME TAXES 
    
  2017   Compared to   2016    
    
  Income Tax Expense increased $1 billion primarily due to an increase in pretax book income in 2017 driven by the impairment of certain merchant generation assets in 2016.  The increase in Income Tax Expense is also due to the prior year reversal of a $66 million capital loss valuation allowance related to the pending sale of certain merchant generation assets, the prior year reversal of a $56 million unrealized capital loss valuation allowance where AEP effectively settled a 2011 audit issue with the IRS as well as 2015 tax return adjustments recorded in 2016 related to the disposition of AEP s commercial barging operations. 
    
  2016   Compared to   2015    
    
  Income Tax Expense decreased $993 million primarily due to reduced pretax book income as a result of the impairment of certain merchant generation assets, the reversal of capital loss valuation allowances related to the pending sale of certain merchant generation assets and the settlement of a 2011 audit issue with the IRS as well as 2015 tax return adjustments related to the disposition of AEP s commercial barging operations. 

45 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  AEP measures financial condition by the strength of its balance sheet and the liquidity provided by its cash flows. 
    
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Debt and Equity Capitalization 

(a) 
    Amounts include debt related to the Lawrenceburg Plant that has been classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet.  See  Gavin, Waterford, Darby and Lawrenceburg Plants (Generation   Marketing Segment)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
       
  AEP s ratio of debt-to-total capital decreased from 55.9% as of   December 31, 2016   to 55.5% as of   December 31, 2017   primarily due to an increase in earnings in 2017 as compared to 2016, driven by the impairment of certain merchant generation assets in 2016, partially offset by an increase in long-term debt due to increasing construction expenditures for distribution and transmission investments.  See  Gavin, Waterford, Darby and Lawrenceburg Plants (Generation   Marketing Segment)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining AEP s financial stability.  Management believes AEP has adequate liquidity under its existing credit facilities.  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP had a $3 billion revolving credit facility commitment to support its operations.  Additional liquidity is available from cash from operations and a receivables securitization agreement.  Management is committed to maintaining adequate liquidity.  AEP generally uses short-term borrowings to fund working capital needs, property acquisitions and construction until long-term funding is arranged.  Sources of long-term funding include issuance of long-term debt, sale-leaseback or leasing agreements or common stock.  
    
  Commercial Paper Credit Facilities 
    
  AEP manages liquidity by maintaining adequate external financing commitments.  As of December 31,   2017  , available liquidity was approximately $2.3 billion as illustrated in the table below: 

46 

AEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries.  The program is used to fund both a Utility Money Pool, which funds the utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain nonutility subsidiaries.  In addition, the program also funds, as direct borrowers, the short-term debt requirements of other subsidiaries that are not participants in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons.  The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during   2017   was $1.6 billion.  The weighted-average interest rate for AEP s commercial paper during   2017   was 1.25%. 
    
  Other Credit Facilities 
    
  An uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility.  AEP issues letters of credit under four uncommitted facilities totaling $345 million.  In October 2017, a $100 million uncommitted facility expired.  As of December 31,   2017  , the maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities was $104 million with maturities ranging from January 2018 to December 2018. 
    
  Financing Plan 
    
  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP has $2.1 billion of long-term debt due within one year.  This includes $594 million of Pollution Control Bonds with mandatory tender dates and credit support for variable interest rates that requires the debt be classified as current and $403 million of securitization bonds and DCC Fuel notes.  Management plans to refinance the majority of the other maturities due within one year. 
    
  Securitized Accounts Receivables 
    
  AEP s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of $750 million from bank conduits to purchase receivables.  The agreement expires in June 2019. 
    
  Debt Covenants and Borrowing Limitations 
    
  AEP s credit agreements contain certain covenants and require it to maintain a percentage of debt to total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%.  The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually defined in AEP s credit agreements.  Debt as defined in the revolving credit agreements excludes securitization bonds and debt of AEP Credit.  As of December 31,   2017  , this contractually-defined percentage was 53.5%.  Nonperformance under these covenants could result in an event of default under these credit agreements.  In addition, the acceleration of AEP s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of AEP s major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements.  This condition also applies in a majority of AEP s non-exchange traded commodity contracts and would similarly allow lenders and counterparties to declare the outstanding amounts payable.  However, a default under AEP s non-exchange traded commodity contracts would not cause an event of default under its credit agreements. 
    
  The revolving credit facility does not permit the lenders to refuse a draw on any facility if a material adverse change occurs. 
    
  Utility Money Pool borrowings and external borrowings may not exceed amounts authorized by regulatory orders and AEP manages its borrowings to stay within those authorized limits. 
    
  Dividend Policy and Restrictions 
    
  The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share in January   2018  .  Future dividends may vary depending upon AEP s profit levels, operating cash flow levels and capital requirements, as well as financial and other business conditions existing at the time.  Parent s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries.  Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions  
  
   47 

on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends.  Management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant impact on its ability to access cash to meet the payment of dividends on its common stock. 
    
  Credit Ratings 
    
  AEP and its utility subsidiaries do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit downgrade, but its access to the commercial paper market may depend on its credit ratings.  In addition, downgrades in AEP s credit ratings by one of the rating agencies could increase its borrowing costs.  Counterparty concerns about the credit quality of AEP or its utility subsidiaries could subject AEP to additional collateral demands under adequate assurance clauses under its derivative and non-derivative energy contracts.  
    
  CASH FLOW 
    
  AEP relies primarily on cash flows from operations, debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and investing activities.  AEP s investing and capital requirements are primarily capital expenditures, repaying of long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders.  AEP uses short-term debt, including commercial paper, as a bridge to long-term debt financing.  The levels of borrowing may vary significantly due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows. 

Operating Activities 

(a) 
    Non-Cash Adjustments to Income from Continuing Operations includes Depreciation and Amortization, Deferred Income Taxes, Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges, Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction, Amortization of Nuclear Fuel, Pension and Postemployment Benefit Reserves, and Gain on Sale of Merchant Generation Assets. 

48 

2017 Compared to 2016 
    
  Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities   decreased by $251 million primarily due to the following: 
             
    A $189 million decrease in cash from Changes in Certain Components of Continuing Working Capital.  This decrease in cash is primarily due to higher employee-related payments and increased revenue refunds. 
                
    A $98 million decrease in cash due to refunds to customers as a result of the 2016 Global Settlement in Ohio. 
                
    An $86 million decrease in cash from Income from Continuing Operations, after non-cash adjustments.  See Results of Operations for further detail. 
     These decreases in cash were partially offset by: 
             
    A $150 million increase in cash from Deferred Fuel Over/Under Recovery, Net.  The increase in cash is primarily due to fluctuations of fuel and purchase power costs at PSO     and collections in the Ohio Phase-in Recovery Rider. 
       
  2016 Compared to 2015 
    
  Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities   decreased by $227 million primarily due to the following: 
             
    A $203 million decrease in cash from Deferred Fuel Over/Under Recovery, Net.  This decrease is primarily due to fluctuations of fuel and purchase power costs at PSO. 
                
    A $196 million decrease in cash from Certain Components of Continuing Working Capital.  This decrease is primarily due to changes in receivables and payables due to timing of cash receipts and payments. 
                
    A $94 million decrease in cash due to the disposition of the Tanner s Creek Plant Site.  See Note   7  - Dispositions, Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Impairments for additional information. 
     These decreases in cash were partially offset by: 
             
    A $205 million increase in cash from Income from Continuing Operations, after non-cash adjustments.  See Results of Operations for additional information. 
       
  Investing Activities 

2017 Compared to 2016 
    
  Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Investing Activities   decreased by $1.4 billion primarily due to the following: 
             
    A $2.2 billion increase in cash due to the sale of certain merchant generation assets in 2017.  See Note   7   - Dispositions, Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Impairments for additional information. 
                 
    A $21 million increase in cash due to reduced nuclear fuel purchases.  Reduction in purchases is primarily due to variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle. 
     These increases in cash were partially offset by: 
             
    A $910 million decrease in cash due to increased construction expenditures, primarily due to increases in Transmission and Distribution Utilities of $499 million, AEP Transmission Holdco of $275 million and Generation   Marketing of $95 million. 

49 

2016 Compared to 2015 
    
  Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Investing Activities   increased by $474 million primarily due to the following: 
             
    A $273 million decrease in cash due to increased construction expenditures, primarily due to increases in AEP Transmission Holdco of $138 million and Generation   Marketing of $99 million. 
                 
    A $37 million decrease in cash due to increased nuclear fuel purchases.  Increase in purchases is primarily due to variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle. 
       
  Financing Activities 

2017 Compared to 2016 
    
  Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Financing Activities   increased by $1.1 billion primarily due to the following: 
             
    A $1.3 billion decrease in cash due to increased retirements of long-term debt.  See Note   14   - Financing Activities for additional information. 
                
    A $987 million decrease in cash from short-term debt primarily due to increased repayments of commercial paper.  See Note   14   - Financing Activities for additional information.   
                
    A $71 million decrease in cash due to increased common stock dividend payments primarily due to increased dividends per share from 2016 to 2017. 
                
    A $22 million decrease in cash due to reduced proceeds from issuances of common stock.       
     These decreases in cash were partially offset by: 
             
    A $1.3 billion increase in cash due to increased issuances of long-term debt.  See Note   14   - Financing Activities for additional information. 
       
  2016 Compared to 2015 
    
  Net Cash Flows from Continuing Financing Activities   increased by $1.2 billion primarily due to the following: 
             
    A $1.5 billion increase in cash from short-term debt primarily due to draws on commercial paper.  See Note   14   - Financing Activities for additional information.   
                
    A $603 million increase in cash due to decreased retirements of long-term debt.  See Note   14   - Financing Activities for additional information. 
                
    A $93 million increase in cash due to a make whole payment on extinguishment of long-term debt in 2015. This make whole payment was a result of the early retirement of APCo senior unsecured notes.       
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    An $842 million decrease in cash due to decreased issuances of long-term debt.  See Note   14   - Financing Activities for additional information. 
                
    A $62 million decrease in cash due to increased common stock dividend payments primarily due to increased dividends per share from 2015 to 2016. 
                
    A $47 million decrease in cash due to reduced proceeds from the issuance of common stock. 

50 

The following financing activities occurred during   2017  : 
    
  AEP Common Stock: 

During 2017, AEP issued 162 thousand shares of common stock under the incentive compensation, employee saving and dividend reinvestment plans and received net proceeds of $12 million. 
       
  Debt: 

During 2017, AEP issued approximately $3.9 billion of long-term debt, including $3.3 billion of senior unsecured notes at interest rates ranging from 2.15% to 4.12%, $215 million of pollution control bonds at interest rates ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%, $77 million of pollution control bonds at variable interest rates and $325 million of other debt at variable interest rates.  The proceeds from these issuances were used to fund long-term debt maturities and construction programs. 
                
    During 2017, AEP entered into interest rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling $1 billion.  The settlement of interest rate derivatives in 2017 resulted in net cash received of $513 thousand.  As of December 31, 2017, AEP had $500 million of notional interest rate derivatives remaining that were designated as fair value hedges. 
       
  In 2018: 

In January and February   2018  , I M retired   $14 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, of Notes Payable related to DCC Fuel. 

In February   2018  , SWEPCo retired   $2 million   of Other Long-term Debt. 
       
  Cash Flow Activity from Discontinued Operations 
    
  In October 2015, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in November 2015 and resulted in net cash proceeds from the sale of $491 million, which were immediately available for use in AEP s continuing operations.  The cash proceeds of $539 million were recorded in Discontinued Investing Activities.  These proceeds were reduced by a make whole payment on the extinguishment of AEPRO long-term debt of $32 million, which was recorded in Discontinued Financing Activities, and transaction costs of $16 million, which were recorded in Discontinued Operating Activities.  In the second quarter of 2016, AEP recorded a $3 million loss related to the final accounting for the sale of AEPRO, which was also recorded in Discontinued Operating Activities.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 

51 

BUDGETED CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES 
    
  Management forecasts approximately $6 billion of construction expenditures in 2018.  For 2019 and 2020 combined, management forecasts construction expenditures of $11.7 billion.  The expenditures are generally for transmission, generation, distribution and required environmental investment to comply with the Federal EPA rules.  Capital expenditures related to the Wind Catcher Project are excluded from these budgeted amounts.  Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, weather, legal reviews and the ability to access capital.  Management expects to fund these construction expenditures through cash flows from operations and financing activities.  Generally, the Registrant Subsidiaries use cash or short-term borrowings under the money pool to fund these expenditures until long-term funding is arranged.  The   2018   estimated construction expenditures include generation, transmission and distribution related investments, as well as expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations as follows: 

(a)     Amount primarily consists of facilities, software and telecommunications. 
    
  The   2018   estimated construction expenditures by Registrant Subsidiary include distribution, transmission and generation related investments, as well as expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations as follows: 

(a)     Amount primarily consists of facilities, software and telecommunications. 

52 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  AEP s current guidelines restrict the use of off-balance sheet financing entities or structures to traditional operating lease arrangements that AEP enters in the normal course of business.  The following identifies significant off-balance sheet arrangements. 
    
  Rockport Plant, Unit 2 
    
  AEGCo and I M entered into a sale-and-leaseback transaction in 1989 with Wilmington Trust Company (Owner Trustee), an unrelated unconsolidated trustee for Rockport Plant, Unit 2 (the Plant).  The Owner Trustee was capitalized with equity from six owner participants with no relationship to AEP or any of its subsidiaries and debt from a syndicate of banks and certain institutional investors.  The future minimum lease payments for AEGCo and I M are $369 million each as of December 31,   2017  . 
    
  The gain from the sale was deferred and is being amortized over the term of the lease, which expires in 2022.  The Owner Trustee owns the Plant and leases it to AEGCo and I M.  AEP s subsidiaries account for the lease as an operating lease with the future payment obligations included in Note   13  .  The lease term is for 33 years with potential renewal options.  At the end of the lease term, AEGCo and I M have the option to renew the lease or the Owner Trustee can sell the Plant.  AEP, as well as AEP s subsidiaries, have no ownership interest in the Owner Trustee and do not guarantee its debt.  See  Rockport Plant Litigation  section of Note   6   for additional information. 
    
  Railcars 
    
  In June 2003, AEP entered into an agreement with BTM Capital Corporation, as lessor, to lease 875 coal-transporting aluminum railcars.  The initial lease term was five years with three consecutive five-year renewal periods for a maximum lease term of twenty years.  AEP intends to maintain the lease for the full lease term of twenty years via the renewal options.  The lease is accounted for as an operating lease.  The future minimum lease obligation is $15 million for the remaining railcars as of December 31,   2017  .  Under a return-and-sale option, the lessor is guaranteed that the sale proceeds will equal at least a specified lessee obligation amount which declines with each five-year renewal.  As of December 31,   2017  , the maximum potential loss was approximately $18 million assuming the fair value of the equipment is zero at the end of the current five-year lease term.  However, management believes that the fair value would produce a sufficient sales price to avoid any loss.  AEP has other railcar lease arrangements that do not utilize this type of financing structure.  See  Railcar Lease  section of Note   13   for additional information. 

53 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION INFORMATION 
    
  AEP s contractual cash obligations include amounts reported on the balance sheets and other obligations disclosed in the footnotes.  The following table summarizes AEP s contractual cash obligations as of December 31,   2017  : 

(a) 
    Represents principal only, excluding interest. 
              (b) 
    Interest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding as of December 31,   2017   and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early redemptions or debt issuances. 
              (c) 
    See  Long-term Debt  section of Note   14  .  Represents principal only, excluding interest. 
              (d) 
    See  Long-term Debt  section of Note   14  .  Represents principal only, excluding interest.  Variable rate debt had interest rates that ranged between 1.54% and 2.93% as of December 31,   2017  . 
               (f) 
    Represents contractual obligations to purchase coal, natural gas, uranium and other consumables as fuel for electric generation along with related transportation of the fuel. 
              (g) 
    Represents only capital assets for which there are signed contracts.  Actual payments are dependent upon and may vary significantly based upon the decision to build, regulatory approval schedules, timing and escalation of project costs.  Includes immaterial costs related to planning of the Wind Catcher Project.  
       
  AEP s $56 million liability related to uncertain tax positions is not included above because management cannot reasonably estimate the cash flows by period. 
    
  AEP s pension funding requirements are not included in the above table.  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP expects to make contributions to the pension plans totaling $101 million in   2018  .  Estimated contributions of $102 million in   2019   and $105 million in   2020   may vary significantly based on market returns, changes in actuarial assumptions and other factors.  Based upon the projected benefit obligation and fair value of assets available to pay pension benefits, the pension plans were 99.2% funded as of December 31,   2017  .  See  Estimated Future Benefit Payments and Contributions  section of Note   8  .  

54 

In addition to the amounts disclosed in the contractual cash obligations table above, additional commitments are made in the normal course of business.  These commitments include standby letters of credit, guarantees for the payment of obligation performance bonds and other commitments.  As of December 31,   2017  , the commitments outstanding under these agreements are summarized in the table below: 

(a) 
    Standby letters of credit (LOCs) are entered into with third parties.  These LOCs are issued in the ordinary course of business and cover items such as natural gas and electricity risk management contracts, construction contracts, insurance programs, security deposits and debt service reserves.  There is no collateral held in relation to any guarantees in excess of the ownership percentages.  In the event any LOC is drawn, there is no recourse to third parties.  See  Letters of Credit  section of Note   6  . 
              (b) 
    See  Guarantees of Third-Party Obligations  section of Note   6  . 
              (c) 
    Performance guarantees and indemnifications issued for energy trading and various sale agreements. 
       
  SIGNIFICANT TAX LEGISLATION    
    
  The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH) included an extension of the 50% bonus depreciation for three years through 2017.  PATH also provided for the extension of research and development, employment and several energy tax credits for 2015.  PATH also includes provisions to extend the wind energy production tax credit through 2016 with a three-year phase-out (2017-2019), and to extend the 30% temporary solar investment tax credit for three years through 2019 with a two-year phase-out (2020-2021).  PATH also provided for a permanent extension of the Research and Development tax credit. 
    
  These enacted provisions had no material impact on net income or financial condition but did have a favorable impact on cash flows in 2015, 2016 and 2017. 
    
  Federal Tax Reform  
    
  In December 2017, legislation referred to as Tax Reform was signed into law.  The majority of the provisions in the new legislation are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.  Tax Reform includes significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, the Code), including amendments which significantly change the taxation of business entities and also includes provisions specific to regulated public utilities.  The more significant changes that affect the Registrants include the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and several technical provisions including, among others, limiting the utilization of net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward period.  The Tax Reform provisions related to regulated public utilities generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, eliminate bonus depreciation for certain property acquired after September 27, 2017 and continue certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. 
    
  Changes in the Code due to Tax Reform had a material impact on the Registrants  2017 financial statements.  See  Federal Tax Reform  section of Note 12 for additional information.  AEP does not expect Tax Reform to have a material impact on future net income, but does anticipate Tax Reform to have an unfavorable impact on future cash flows.

CYBER SECURITY 
    
  Cyber security presents a growing risk for electric utility systems because a cyber-attack could affect critical energy infrastructure.  Breaches to the cyber security of the grid or to the AEP System are potentially disruptive to people, property and commerce and create risk for business, investors and customers.  In February 2013, President Obama signed an executive order that addresses how government agencies will operate and support their functions in cyber security as well as redefines how the government interfaces with critical infrastructure, such as the electric grid.  The AEP System already operates under regulatory cyber security standards to protect critical infrastructure.  The cyber security framework that was being developed through this executive order was reviewed by FERC and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  In 2014, the DOE published an Energy Sector Cyber Security Framework Implementation Guide for utilities to use in adopting and implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework.  AEP continues to be actively engaged in the framework process. 
    
  The electric utility industry is one of the few critical infrastructure functions with mandatory cyber security requirements under the authority of FERC.  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC the authority to oversee reliability of the bulk power system, including the authority to implement mandatory cyber security reliability standards.  The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), which FERC certified as the nation s Electric Reliability Organization, developed mandatory critical infrastructure protection cyber security reliability standards.  AEP began participating in the NERC grid security and emergency response exercises, GridEx, in 2013 and has continued to participate in the bi-yearly exercises through 2017.  These efforts, led by NERC, test and further develop the coordination, threat sharing and interaction between utilities and various government agencies relative to potential cyber and physical threats against the nation s electric grid. 
    
  Critical cyber assets, such as data centers, power plants, transmission operations centers and business networks are protected using multiple layers of cyber security and authentication.  The AEP System is constantly scanned for risks or threats.  Cyber hackers have been able to breach a number of very secure facilities, from federal agencies, banks and retailers to social media sites.  As these events become known and develop, AEP continually assesses its cyber security tools and processes to determine where to strengthen its defenses.  Management continually reviews its business continuity plan to develop an effective recovery effort that decreases response times, limits financial impacts and maintains customer confidence following any business interruption.  Management works closely with a broad range of departments, including Legal, Regulatory, Corporate Communications, Audit Services, Information Technology and Security, to ensure the corporate response to consequences of any breach or potential breach is appropriate both for internal and external audiences based on the specific circumstances surrounding the event. 
    
  Management continues to take steps to enhance the AEP System s capabilities for identifying risks or threats and has shared that knowledge of threats with utility peers, industry and federal agencies.  AEP operates a Cyber Security Intelligence and Response Center responsible for monitoring the AEP System for cyber threats as well as collaborating with internal and external threat sharing partners from both industry and government.  AEP is a member of a number of industry specific threat and information sharing communities including the Department of Homeland Security and  the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center. 
    
  AEP has partnered in the past with a major defense contractor who has significant cyber security experience and technical capabilities developed through their work with the U.S. Department of Defense.  AEP works with a consortium of other utilities across the country, learning how best to share information about potential threats and collaborating with each other.  AEP continues to work with a nonaffiliated entity to conduct several discussions each year about recognizing and investigating cyber vulnerabilities.  Through these types of efforts, AEP is working to protect itself while helping its industry advance its cyber security capabilities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures, including amounts related to legal matters and contingencies.  Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:  

It requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and 
                
    Changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on net income or financial condition. 
       
  Management discusses the development and selection of critical accounting estimates as presented below with the Audit Committee of AEP s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee reviews the disclosures relating to them. 
    
  Management believes that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate.  However, actual results can differ significantly from those estimates. 
    
  The sections that follow present information about critical accounting estimates, as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate. 
    
  Regulatory Accounting 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required 
    
  The Registrants  financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that can result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. 
    
  The Registrants recognize regulatory assets (deferred expenses to be recovered in the future) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) for the economic effects of regulation.  Specifically, the timing of expense and income recognition is matched with regulated revenues.  Liabilities are also recorded for refunds, or probable refunds, to customers that have not been made. 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used 
    
  When incurred costs are probable of recovery through regulated rates, regulatory assets are recorded on the balance sheet.  Management reviews the probability of recovery at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur.  Similarly, regulatory liabilities are recorded when a determination is made that a refund is probable or when ordered by a commission.  Examples of new events that affect probability include changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of a regulatory commission order or passage of new legislation.  The assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to have an impact on the recovery of costs as well as the return of revenues, rate of return earned on invested capital and timing and amount of assets to be recovered through regulated rates.  If recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, that regulatory asset is written-off as a charge against earnings.  A write-off of regulatory assets or establishment of a regulatory liability may also reduce future cash flows since there will be no recovery through regulated rates. 
    
  Effect if Different Assumptions Used 
    
  A change in the above assumptions may result in a material impact on net income.  Refer to Note   5   for further detail related to regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities. 

57 

Revenue Recognition   Unbilled Revenues 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required 
    
  AEP records revenues when energy is delivered to the customer.  The determination of sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month.  At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue accrual is recorded.  This estimate is reversed in the following month and actual revenue is recorded based on meter readings.  PSO and SWEPCo do not record the fuel portion of unbilled revenue in accordance with the applicable state commission regulatory treatment in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. 
    
  Accrued unbilled revenues for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $278 million and $241 million as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP s Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $37 million, $50 million and $(63) million for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The changes in unbilled electric revenues are primarily due to changes in weather and rates.   
    
  Accrued unbilled revenues for the Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment were $202 million and $191 million as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP s Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment were $11 million, $40 million and $(30) million for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The changes in unbilled electric revenues are primarily due to changes in weather and rates.   
    
  Accrued unbilled revenues for the Generation   Marketing segment were $54 million and $49 million as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP s Generation   Marketing segment were $5 million, $2 million and $(3) million for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used 
    
  For each Registrant except AEPTCo, the monthly estimate for unbilled revenues is based upon a primary computation of net generation (generation plus purchases less sales) less the current month s billed KWh and estimated line losses, plus the prior month s unbilled KWh.  However, due to meter reading issues, meter drift and other anomalies, a secondary computation is made, based upon an allocation of billed KWh to the current month and previous month, on a billing cycle-by-cycle basis, and by dividing the current month aggregated result by the billed KWh.  The two methodologies are evaluated to confirm that they are not statistically different.   
    
  For AEP s Generation   Marketing segment, management calculates unbilled revenues by contract using the most recent historic daily activity adjusted for significant known changes in usage. 
    
  Effect if Different Assumptions Used 
    
  If the two methodologies used to estimate unbilled revenue are statistically different, a limiter adjustment is made to bring the primary computation within one standard deviation of the secondary computation.  Additionally, significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period, weather, line losses or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the estimate of unbilled revenue.   

58 

Accounting for Derivative Instruments 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required 
    
  Management considers fair value techniques, valuation adjustments related to credit and liquidity and judgments related to the probability of forecasted transactions occurring within the specified time period to be critical accounting estimates.  These estimates are considered significant because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors. 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used 
    
  The Registrants measure the fair values of derivative instruments and hedge instruments accounted for using MTM accounting based primarily on exchange prices and broker quotes.  If a quoted market price is not available, the fair value is estimated based on the best market information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes, supply and demand market data and other assumptions.  Fair value estimates, based upon the best market information available, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment.  These uncertainties include projections of macroeconomic trends and future commodity prices, including supply and demand levels and future price volatility. 
    
  The Registrants reduce fair values by estimated valuation adjustments for items such as discounting, liquidity and credit quality.  Liquidity adjustments are calculated by utilizing bid/ask spreads to estimate the potential fair value impact of liquidating open positions over a reasonable period of time.  Credit adjustments on risk management contracts are calculated using estimated default probabilities and recovery rates relative to the counterparties or counterparties with similar credit profiles and contractual netting agreements. 
    
  With respect to hedge accounting, management assesses hedge effectiveness and evaluates a forecasted transaction s probability of occurrence within the specified time period as provided in the original hedge documentation. 
    
  Effect if Different Assumptions Used 
    
  There is inherent risk in valuation modeling given the complexity and volatility of energy markets.  Therefore, it is possible that results in future periods may be materially different as contracts settle. 
    
  The probability that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur by the end of the specified time period could change operating results by requiring amounts currently classified in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to be classified into operating income. 
    
  For additional information regarding derivatives, hedging and fair value measurements, see Notes   10   and   11  .  See  Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities  section of Note   1   for AEP s fair value calculation policy. 
    
  Long-Lived Assets 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required 
    
  In accordance with the requirements of  Property, Plant and Equipment  accounting guidance and  Regulated Operations  accounting guidance, the Registrants evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such assets may not be recoverable including planned abandonments and a probable disallowance for rate-making on a plant under construction or the assets meet the held-for-sale criteria.  The Registrants utilize a group composite method of depreciation to estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets.  The evaluations of long-lived, held and used assets may result from abandonments, significant decreases in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, as well as other economic or operations analyses.  If the carrying amount is not recoverable, the  
  
   59 

Registrants record an impairment to the extent that the fair value of the asset is less than its book value.  Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the undiscounted and discounted future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value, in some instances) associated with the asset.  For assets held for sale, an impairment is recognized if the expected net sales price is less than its book value.  Any impairment charge is recorded against earnings. 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used 
    
  The fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available.  In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, the Registrants estimate fair value using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow projections or other market indicators of fair value such as bids received, comparable sales or independent appraisals.  Cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made.  Estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.  Also, when measuring fair value, management evaluates the characteristics of the asset or liability to determine if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  Such characteristics include, for example, the condition and location of the asset or restrictions on the use of the asset.  The Registrants perform depreciation studies that include a review of any external factors that may affect the useful life to determine composite depreciation rates and related lives which are subject to periodic review by state regulatory commissions for regulated assets.  The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. 
    
  Effect if Different Assumptions Used 
    
  In connection with the evaluation of long-lived assets in accordance with the requirements of  Property, Plant and Equipment  accounting guidance, the fair value of the asset can vary if different estimates and assumptions would have been used in the applied valuation techniques.  The estimate for depreciation rates takes into account the history of interim capital replacements and the amount of salvage expected.  In cases of impairment, the best estimate of fair value was made using valuation methods based on the most current information at that time.  Fluctuations in realized sales proceeds versus the estimated fair value of the asset are generally due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, differences in subsequent market conditions, the level of bidder interest, timing and terms of the transactions and management s analysis of the benefits of the transaction. 

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
    
  AEP maintains a qualified, defined benefit pension plan (Qualified Plan), which covers substantially all nonunion and certain union employees, and unfunded, nonqualified supplemental plans (Nonqualified Plans) to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted under the provisions of the tax law for participants in the Qualified Plan (collectively the Pension Plans).  Additionally, AEP entered into individual employment contracts with certain current and retired executives that provide additional retirement benefits as a part of the Nonqualified Plans.  AEP also sponsors other postretirement benefit plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (Postretirement Plans).  The Pension Plans and Postretirement Plans are collectively referred to as the Plans. 
    
  For a discussion of investment strategy, investment limitations, target asset allocations and the classification of investments within the fair value hierarchy, see  Investments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities  and  Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities  sections of Note   1  .  See Note   8   for information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement and postretirement benefits. 

60 

The following table shows the net periodic cost (credit) of the Plans: 

The net periodic benefit cost is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including expected long-term rates of return on the Plans  assets.  In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for   2018  , management evaluated input from actuaries and investment consultants, including their reviews of asset class return expectations as well as long-term inflation assumptions.  Management also considered historical returns of the investment markets and tax rates which affect a portion of the Postretirement Plans  assets.  Management anticipates that the investment managers employed for the Plans will invest the assets to generate future returns averaging   6%   for the Qualified Plan and   6%   for the Postretirement Plans. 
    
  The expected long-term rate of return on the Plans  assets is based on management s targeted asset allocation and expected investment returns for each investment category.  Assumptions for the Plans are summarized in the following table: 

Management regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the investments to the targeted allocation.  Management believes that   6%   for the Qualified Plan and   6%   for the Postretirement Plans are reasonable estimates of the long-term rate of return on the Plans  assets.  The Pension Plans  assets had an actual gain of 12.86% and 6.98% for the years ended December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  The Postretirement Plans  assets had an actual gain of 18.38% and 5.39% for the years ended December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  Management will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust the assumptions as necessary. 
    
  AEP bases the determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year volatility.  This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur.  Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets.  Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP had cumulative gains of approximately $215 million that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets.  These unrecognized market-related net actuarial gains may result in decreases in the future pension costs depending on several factors, including whether such gains at each measurement date exceed the corridor in accordance with  Compensation   Retirement Benefits  accounting guidance. 

61 

The method used to determine the discount rate that AEP utilizes for determining future obligations is a duration-based method in which a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds is constructed with cash flows matching the benefit plan liability.  The composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio is used as the discount rate for the plan.  The discount rate as of December 31,   2017   under this method was   3.65%   for the Qualified Plan,   3.45%   for the Nonqualified Plans and   3.6%   for the Postretirement Plans.  Due to the effect of the unrecognized actuarial losses and based on an expected rate of return on the Pension Plans  assets of   6%  , discount rates of   3.65%   and   3.45%   and various other assumptions, management estimates that the pension costs for the Pension Plans will approximate $77 million, $59 million and $51 million in   2018  ,   2019   and   2020  , respectively.  Based on an expected rate of return on the Postretirement Plans  assets of   6%  , a discount rate of   3.6%   and various other assumptions, management estimates Postretirement Plan credits will approximate $102 million, $103 million and $104 million in   2018  ,   2019   and   2020  , respectively.  Future actual costs will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the Plans.  The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results.  The effects of a 50 basis point change to selective actuarial assumptions are included in the  Effect if Different Assumptions Used  section below. 
    
  The value of AEP s Pension Plans  assets increased to   $5.2 billion   as of December 31,   2017   from   $4.8 billion   as of December 31,   2016   primarily due to investment returns and company contributions in excess of benefit payments from AEP subsidiaries.  During   2017  , the Qualified Plan paid $346 million and the Nonqualified Plans paid $6 million in benefits to plan participants.  The value of AEP s Postretirement Plans  assets increased to   $1.7 billion   as of December 31,   2017   from   $1.5 billion   as of December 31,   2016   primarily due to investment returns and contributions from AEP subsidiaries and the participants in excess of benefit payments.  The Postretirement Plans paid   $129 million   in benefits to plan participants during   2017  . 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required 
    
  AEP sponsors pension and other retirement and postretirement benefit plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements.  These benefits are accounted for under  Compensation  and  Plan Accounting  accounting guidance.  The measurement of pension and postretirement benefit obligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions. 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used 
    
  The critical assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: 

Discount rate 
                
    Compensation increase rate 
                
    Cash balance crediting rate 
                
    Health care cost trend rate 
                
    Expected return on plan assets 
       
  Other assumptions, such as retirement, mortality and turnover, are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience. 

62 

Effect if Different Assumptions Used 
    
  The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, longer or shorter life spans of participants or higher or lower lump sum versus annuity payout elections by plan participants.  These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recorded.  If a 50 basis point change were to occur for the following assumptions, the approximate effect on the financial statements would be as follows:

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  See Note   2   - New Accounting Pronouncements for information related to accounting pronouncements adopted in 2017 and pronouncements effective in the future. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Market Risks 
    
  The Vertically Integrated Utilities segment is exposed to certain market risks as a major power producer and through transactions in power, coal, natural gas and marketing contracts.  These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk.  In addition, this segment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk from occasionally procuring various services and materials used in its energy business from foreign suppliers.  These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates. 
    
  The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment is exposed to energy procurement risk and interest rate risk. 
    
  The Generation   Marketing segment conducts marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO.  This segment is exposed to certain market risks as a marketer of wholesale and retail electricity.  These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk.  These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates.  In addition, the Generation   Marketing segment is also exposed to certain market risks as a power producer and through transactions in wholesale electricity, natural gas and marketing contracts. 
    
  Management employs risk management contracts including physical forward and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts.  Management engages in risk management of power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business.  As a result, AEP is subject to price risk.  The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and  
  
   63 

Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.  AEPSC s market risk oversight staff independently monitors risk policies, procedures and risk levels and provides members of the Commercial Operations Risk Committee (Regulated Risk Committee) and the Energy Supply Risk Committee (Competitive Risk Committee) various reports regarding compliance with policies, limits and procedures.  The Regulated Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President of Generation, Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations and Chief Risk Officer.  The Competitive Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer in addition to Energy Supply s President and Vice President.  When commercial activities exceed predetermined limits, positions are modified to reduce the risk to be within the limits unless specifically approved by the respective committee. 
    
  The following table summarizes the reasons for changes in total MTM value as compared to December 31,   2016  : 

(a) 
    Reflects fair value on primarily long-term structured contracts which are typically with customers that seek fixed pricing to limit their risk against fluctuating energy prices.  The contract prices are valued against market curves associated with the delivery location and delivery term.  A significant portion of the total volumetric position has been economically hedged. 
              (b) 
    Market fluctuations are attributable to various factors such as supply/demand, weather, etc. 
              (c) 
    Relates to the net gains (losses) of those contracts that are not reflected on the statements of income.  These net gains (losses) are recorded as regulatory liabilities/assets. 
       
  See Note   10     Derivatives and Hedging and Note   11     Fair Value Measurements for additional information related to risk management contracts.  The following tables and discussion provide information on credit risk and market volatility risk. 
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  Credit risk is mitigated in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis.  Management uses Moody s Investors Service Inc., S P Global Inc. and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial statements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis. 

64 

AEP has risk management contracts with numerous counterparties.  Since open risk management contracts are valued based on changes in market prices of the related commodities, exposures change daily.  As of December 31,   2017  ,  credit exposure net of collateral to sub investment grade counterparties was approximately 7.1%, expressed in terms of net MTM assets, net receivables and the net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM (representing economic risk even though there may not be risk of accounting loss).  As of December 31,   2017  , the following table approximates AEP s counterparty credit quality and exposure based on netting across commodities, instruments and legal entities where applicable: 

In addition, AEP is exposed to credit risk related to participation in RTOs.  For each of the RTOs in which AEP participates, this risk is generally determined based on the proportionate share of member gross activity over a specified period of time. 
    
  Value at Risk (VaR) Associated with Risk Management Contracts 
    
  Management uses a risk measurement model, which calculates VaR, to measure AEP s commodity price risk in the risk management portfolio.  The VaR is based on the variance-covariance method using historical prices to estimate volatilities and correlations and assumes a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period.  Based on this VaR analysis, as of December 31,   2017  , a near term typical change in commodity prices is not expected to materially impact net income, cash flows or financial condition. 
    
  Management calculates the VaR for both a trading and non-trading portfolio.  The trading portfolio consists primarily of contracts related to energy trading and marketing activities.  The non-trading portfolio consists primarily of economic hedges of generation and retail supply activities.  The following tables show the end, high, average and low market risk as measured by VaR for the periods indicated: 
    
  VaR Model 
  Trading Portfolio 

VaR Model 
  Non-Trading Portfolio 

65 

Management back-tests VaR results against performance due to actual price movements.  Based on the assumed 95% confidence interval, the performance due to actual price movements would be expected to exceed the VaR at least once every 20 trading days. 
    
  As the VaR calculation captures recent price movements, management also performs regular stress testing of the trading portfolio to understand AEP s exposure to extreme price movements.  A historical-based method is employed whereby the current trading portfolio is subjected to actual, observed price movements from the last several years in order to ascertain which historical price movements translated into the largest potential MTM loss.  Management then researches the underlying positions, price movements and market events that created the most significant exposure and reports the findings to the Risk Executive Committee, Regulated Risk Committee, or Competitive Risk Committee as appropriate. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Management utilizes an Earnings at Risk (EaR) model to measure interest rate market risk exposure.  EaR statistically quantifies the extent to which interest expense could vary over the next twelve months and gives a probabilistic estimate of different levels of interest expense.  The resulting EaR is interpreted as the dollar amount by which actual interest expense for the next twelve months could exceed expected interest expense with a one-in-twenty chance of occurrence.  The primary drivers of EaR are from the existing floating rate debt (including short-term debt) as well as long-term debt issuances in the next twelve months.  As calculated on debt outstanding as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , the estimated EaR on AEP s debt portfolio for the following twelve months was $32 million and $29 million, respectively.

  American Electric Power Company, Inc. 
    
  Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity, and of cash flows for the year then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the  consolidated financial statements ).  We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework     (2013)     issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).   
    
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013) issued by the COSO. 
    
  Basis for Opinions 
    
  The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
    
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.   
    
  Our audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

AEP TEXAS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 
    
  AEP Texas was formed by the merger of TCC and TNC into AEP Utilities, Inc. on December 31, 2016.  The merging parties retained their respective rate structures.  Following the merger, AEP Utilities, Inc. changed its name to AEP Texas Inc. 
    
  Prior to the merger, AEP Utilities, Inc. was a subsidiary of AEP and holding company for TCC, TNC and CSW Energy, Inc.  CSW Energy, Inc. owns the Desert Sky and Trent Wind Farms (Wind Farms).  As a result of this merger, the assets and liabilities of CSW Energy, Inc. were transferred to a competitive AEP affiliate.  
    
  AEP Texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1,030,000 retail customers through REPs in west, central and southern Texas.  Among the principal industries served by AEP Texas are chemical and petroleum refining, chemicals and allied products, oil and natural gas extraction, food processing, metal refining, plastics and machinery equipment, agriculture and the manufacturing or processing of cotton seed products, oil products, precision and consumer metal products, meat products and gypsum products.  The territory served by AEP Texas also includes several military installations and correctional facilities.  AEP Texas is a member of ERCOT.  Under Texas Restructuring Legislation, AEP Texas  utility predecessors, TCC and TNC, exited the generation business and ceased serving retail load.  However, AEP Texas continues as part owner in the Oklaunion Plant operated by PSO but has leased its entire portion of the output of the plant through 2027 to a non-utility affiliate.  AEP Texas consolidates AEP Texas North Generation Company, LLC, AEP Texas Central Transition Funding II LLC and AEP Texas Central Transition Funding III LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

  Reconciliation of Year Ended December 31,   2016   to Year Ended December 31,   2017    
  Net Income 
  (in millions) 

The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $44 million primarily due to an increase in revenues associated with the Distribution Cost Recovery Factor revenue rider. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   increased $36 million primarily due to recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT. 
                
    Other Revenues   increased $8 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $12 million increase in securitization revenue.  This increase was offset below in Depreciation and Amortization and in Interest Expense. 
     This increase was partially offset by: 
             
    A $4 million decrease in performance bonus revenues and true-ups related to energy efficiency programs. 

80 

Expenses and Other, Income Tax Expense (Credit) and Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses decreased $3 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $9 million decrease in employee-related expenses. 
                
    A $6 million decrease due to a charitable donation to the AEP Foundation in 2016. 
                
    A $3 million decrease due to a gain from land sales. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $10 million increase in ERCOT transmission expenses. 
                
    A $5 million increase in non-deferred storm expenses primarily due to Hurricane Harvey. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses increased $36 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $21 million increase in securitization amortizations related to transition funding.  This increase was offset in Other Revenues above and in Interest Expense below. 
                
    A $15 million increase in depreciation expense primarily due to an increase in depreciable base of transmission and distribution assets. 
                
    Taxes Other Than Income Taxes   increased $15 million primarily due to increased property taxes as a result of additional capital investment and increased tax rates. 
                
    Interest Income   decreased $8 million primarily due to a prior year tax adjustment. 
                
    Interest Expense   decreased $2 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $9 million decrease in securitization transition assets due to the final maturity of the first securitization bond.  This decrease was offset above in Other Revenues and in Depreciation and Amortization. 
     This decrease was partially offset by: 
             
    A $7 million increase in interest due to the issuance of long-term debt in September 2017. 
                
    Income Tax Expense (Credit)   decreased $83 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $117 million decrease due to the recording of federal income tax adjustments related to Tax Reform. 
     This decrease was partially offset by: 
             
    A $34 million increase in pretax book income and by the recording of federal and state income tax adjustments. 
                
    Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax   had a favorable impact of $49 million primarily due to the impairment of the Wind Farms in the third quarter of 2016.

    A $237 million increase in formula rates driven by the favorable impact of the modification of the PJM OATT formula combined with an increase driven by continued investments in transmission assets 
                
    A $7 million increase due to rental revenue related to various AEPTCo facilities. 
       
  Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $25 million primarily due to increased transmission investment. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses increased $31 million primarily due to higher depreciable base. 
                
    Taxes Other Than Income Taxes   increased $21 million primarily due to increased property taxes as a result of additional transmission investment. 
                
    Interest Expense   increased $22 million primarily due to higher outstanding long-term debt balances.

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
    
  The management of AEP Transmission Company, LLC and Subsidiaries (AEPTCo) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  AEPTCo s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  Management assessed the effectiveness of AEPTCo s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2017  .  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013).  Based on management s assessment, management concluded AEPTCo s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,   2017  . 
    
  This annual report does not include an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, AEPTCo s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit AEPTCo to provide only management s report in this annual report.

APPALACHIAN POWER COMPANY 
  AND SUBSIDIARIES

APPALACHIAN POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 
    
  As a public utility, APCo engages in the generation and purchase of electric power, and the subsequent sale, transmission and distribution of that power to 958,000 retail customers in its service territory in southwestern Virginia and southern West Virginia.  APCo consolidates Cedar Coal Company, Central Appalachian Coal Company, Southern Appalachian Coal Company and Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  APCo sells power at wholesale to municipalities.  APCo shares its off-system sales margins with its Virginia customers.  APCo s off-system sales margins are returned to APCo s West Virginia customers through the ENEC clause.   
    
  Effective January 2014, the FERC approved a PCA among APCo, I M and KPCo with AEPSC as the agent to coordinate the participants  respective power supply resources.  Effective May 2015, the PCA was revised and approved by the FERC to include WPCo.  Under the PCA, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo are individually responsible for planning their respective capacity obligations.  Further, the Restated and Amended PCA allows, but does not obligate, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo to participate collectively under a common fixed resource requirement capacity plan in PJM and to participate in specified collective off-system sales and purchase activities. 
    
  Also effective January 2014, the FERC approved a Bridge Agreement among AGR, APCo, I M, KPCo and OPCo with AEPSC as the agent.  The Bridge Agreement is an interim arrangement to: (a) address the treatment of purchases and sales made by AEPSC on behalf of member companies that extend beyond termination of the Interconnection Agreement and (b) address how member companies would fulfill their existing obligations under the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement through the 2014/2015 PJM planning year.  Under the Bridge Agreement, AGR committed to meet capacity obligations of member companies through the PJM Planning year that ended May 31, 2015. 
    
  AEPSC conducts power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other risk management activities on behalf of APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo.  Effective January 2014, and revised in May 2015, power and natural gas risk management activities are allocated based on the member companies  respective equity positions.  Risk management activities primarily include power and natural gas physical transactions, financially-settled swaps and exchange-traded futures.  AEPSC settles the majority of the physical forward contracts by entering into offsetting contracts.  APCo shared in the revenues and expenses associated with these risk management activities with the member companies. 
    
  Under the SIA, AEPSC allocates physical and financial revenues and expenses from transactions with neighboring utilities, power marketers and other power and natural gas risk management activities based upon the location of such activity, with margins resulting from trading and marketing activities originating in PJM and MISO generally accruing to the benefit of APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo and trading and marketing activities originating in SPP generally accruing to the benefit of PSO and SWEPCo.  Margins resulting from other transactions are allocated among APCo, I M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo based upon the common shareholder s equity of these companies. 
  To minimize the credit requirements and operating constraints when operating within PJM, participating AEP companies, including APCo, agreed to a netting of certain payment obligations incurred by the participating AEP companies against certain balances due to such AEP companies and to hold PJM harmless from actions that any one or more AEP companies may take with respect to PJM. 
    
  APCo is jointly and severally liable for activity conducted by AEPSC on behalf of APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo related to power purchase and sale activity.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  KWh Sales/Degree Days 

Heating degree days and cooling degree days are metrics commonly used in the utility industry as a measure of the impact of weather on revenues. 

(a) 
    Heating degree days are calculated on a 55 degree temperature base. 
              (b) 
    Normal Heating/Cooling represents the thirty-year average of degree days. 
              (c) 
    Cooling degree days are calculated on a 65 degree temperature base.

  Reconciliation of Year Ended December 31,   2016   to Year Ended December 31,   2017    
  Net Income 
  (in millions) 

The major components of the decrease in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   decreased $74 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $50 million decrease in weather-related usage primarily driven by a 16% decrease in cooling degree days and a 12% decrease in heating degree days. 
                
    A $9 million decrease in weather-normalized margins primarily driven by the residential and commercial classes. 
                
    A $9 million decrease primarily due to prior year recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia as approved by the WVPSC. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   increased $33 million primarily due to an increase in formula rates driven by continued investment in transmission assets.  This increase was partially offset by a corresponding increase in Expenses and Other items below. 
     
   105 

Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses decreased $12 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    An $11 million decrease in employee-related expenses.  
                
    A $10 million decrease due to a charitable donation to the AEP Foundation in 2016.  
                
    An $8 million decrease in storm-related expenses. 
                
    A $7 million decrease in generation plant maintenance expenses. 
                
    A $3 million decrease in vegetation management expenses. 
                
    A $2 million decrease in asset retirement obligations due to the closure of the Mountaineer Carbon Capture and Storage Facility. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $21 million increase in recoverable PJM transmission expenses.  This increase in expense was offset within Gross Margin above.  
                 
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses increased $19 million primarily due to a higher depreciable base. 
                
    Income Tax Expense   decreased $14 million primarily due to a decrease in pretax book income, partially offset by federal income tax adjustments, including those related to Tax Reform, and by the regulatory accounting treatment of state income taxes.

    A $31 million increase related to over/under recovery of riders. 
                
    A $2 million decrease in PJM related expenses primarily due to reduced FTRs. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $37 million decrease in FERC generation wholesale municipal and cooperative revenues primarily due to an annual formula rate true-up and changes to the annual formula rate. 
                
    A $25 million decrease in weather-related usage primarily due to a 24% decrease in cooling degree days and a 6% decrease in heating degree days. 
                
    An $8 million decrease in weather-normalized margins. 
                
    A $6 million decrease due to increased costs for power acquired under the Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I M. 
                
    Margins from Off-system Sales   increased $4 million primarily due to higher market prices and increased sales volume. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   decreased $26 million primarily due to an annual formula rate true-up and reduced net PJM Network Integration Transmission Service revenues resulting from increased affiliated transmission-related charges. 
                
    Other Revenues   decreased $4 million primarily due to a decrease in barging deliveries by River Transportation Division (RTD).  The decrease in RTD revenue was partially offset by a corresponding decrease in other expense items below. 
     
   119 

Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $16 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $43 million increase in transmission expenses primarily due to an increase in recoverable PJM expenses.  This increase in expense was partially offset within Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $21 million increase in Cook Plant refueling outage amortization expense due to increased costs of outages in 2017. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $12 million decrease in employee-related expenses. 
                
    A $10 million decrease due to a charitable donation to the AEP Foundation in 2016. 
                
    A $9 million decrease in outside service expense at Cook Plant primarily due to a decrease in various maintenance activities. 
                
    A $7 million decrease primarily due to the 2016 write-off of obsolete materials at Cook Plant. 
                
    A $5 million decrease in nuclear refueling outage expense not deferred primarily due to a single refueling outage at Cook Plant during 2017 compared to two in 2016. 
                
    A $4 million decrease in other expenses primarily due to a decrease in an accrual related to an environmental liability for remediation work. 
                
    Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges   decreased $11 million due to the impairment of I M s Price River coal reserves in 2016. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses     increased $19 million primarily due to a higher depreciable base. 
                
    Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction   decreased $4 million primarily due to a Cook Life Cycle Management project going into service in January 2017. 
                
    Interest Expense   increased $10 million primarily due to higher long-term debt balances. 
                
    Income Tax Expense   increased $14 million primarily due to the recording of federal income tax adjustments and other book/tax differences which are accounted for on a flow-through basis, partially offset by the regulatory accounting treatment of state income taxes and a decrease in pretax book income.

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
    
  The management of Indiana Michigan Power Company and Subsidiaries (I M) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  I M s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  Management assessed the effectiveness of I M s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2017  .  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013).  Based on management s assessment, management concluded I M s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,   2017  . 
    
  This annual report does not include an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, I M s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit I M to provide only management s report in this annual report.

OHIO POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 
    
  As a public utility, OPCo engages in the transmission and distribution of power to 1,477,000 retail customers in the northwestern, central, eastern and southern sections of Ohio.  OPCo purchases energy and capacity at auction to serve its remaining SSO customers.  In accordance with the PUCO s corporate separation order, OPCo remains responsible to provide power and capacity to OPCo customers who have not switched electric providers.  Effective January 2014, OPCo purchased power from both affiliated and nonaffiliated entities, subject to auction requirements and PUCO approval, to meet the energy and capacity needs of customers.  OPCo consolidates Ohio Phase-in Recovery Funding LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary. 
    
  Effective January 2014, the FERC approved a Bridge Agreement among AGR, APCo, I M, KPCo and OPCo with AEPSC as the agent.  The Bridge Agreement is an interim arrangement to: (a) address the treatment of purchases and sales made by AEPSC on behalf of member companies that extend beyond termination of the Interconnection Agreement and (b) address how member companies would fulfill their existing obligations under the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement through the 2014/2015 PJM planning year.  Under the Bridge Agreement, AGR committed to meet capacity obligations of member companies through the PJM Planning year that ended May 31, 2015. 
    
  AEPSC conducts gasoline, diesel fuel, energy procurement and risk management activities on OPCo s behalf.   
    
  To minimize the credit requirements and operating constraints when operating within PJM, participating AEP companies, including OPCo, agreed to a netting of certain payment obligations incurred by the participating AEP companies against certain balances due to such AEP companies and to hold PJM harmless from actions that any one or more AEP companies may take with respect to PJM.

  Reconciliation of Year Ended December 31,   2016   to Year Ended December 31,   2017    
  Net Income 
  (in millions) 

The major components of the decrease in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of purchased electricity and amortization of generation deferrals were as follows: 

Retail Margins   decreased $60 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $178 million decrease in revenues associated with the Universal Service Fund (USF) surcharge rate decrease.  This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses below. 
                
    An $83 million decrease due to the impact of a 2016 regulatory deferral of capacity costs related to OPCo's December 2016 Global Settlement. 
                
    A $23 million net decrease in recovery of equity carrying charges related to the PIRR, net of associated amortizations.  
                
    A $21 million decrease in revenues associated with smart grid riders.  This decrease was offset in various expenses below. 
                
    A $9 million decrease in Energy Efficiency/Peak Demand Reduction rider revenues and associated deferrals.  This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses below. 
                
    A $7 million decrease in state excise taxes due to a decrease in metered KWh.  This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes below. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $150 million net increase due to regulatory provisions for refund primarily due to the impact of 2016 provisions for refund related to OPCo's December 2016 Global Settlement. 
                
    A $62 million increase due to the recovery of losses from a power contract with OVEC.  The PUCO approved a PPA rider beginning in January 2017 to recover any net expense related to the deferral of OVEC losses starting in June 2016.  This increase was offset by a corresponding decrease in Margins from Off-system Sales below. 
                
    A $31 million net increase in Basic Transmission Cost Rider revenues and recoverable PJM expenses.  This increase was offset by a corresponding increase in Other Operation and Maintenance below. 
     
   133 

A $16 million net increase in RSR revenues less associated amortizations. 
                
    A $7 million increase in rider revenues associated with the DIR.  This increase was partially offset in various expenses below. 
                
    Margins from Off-system Sales   decreased $85 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $62 million decrease due to current year losses from a power contract with OVEC which was offset in Retail Margins above as a result of the OVEC PPA rider beginning in January 2017. 
                
    A $41 million decrease due to the 2016 reversal of prior year provisions for regulatory loss. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    An $18 million increase primarily due to the impact of prior year losses from a power contract with OVEC which was not included in the OVEC PPA rider. 
       
  Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses decreased $202 million primarily due to the following:  
                
    A $178 million decrease in remitted USF surcharge payments to the Ohio Department of Development to fund an energy assistance program for qualified Ohio customers.  This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $22 million decrease primarily due to charitable donations in 2016, including the AEP Foundation. 
                
    A $13 million decrease in recoverable smart grid expenses.  This decrease was offset in Retail Margins above.  
                
    A $10 million decrease in Energy Efficiency/Peak Demand Reduction rider costs and associated deferrals.  This decrease was partially offset by a corresponding decrease in Retail Margins above. 
                
    An $8 million decrease in employee-related expenses. 
                
    A $7 million decrease in securitized customer accounts receivable expenses. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $33 million increase in recoverable PJM expenses.  This increase was partially offset by a corresponding increase in Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $14 million increase due to formula rate true-ups related to transmission expenses that will be recovered in 2018. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses decreased $13 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    An $8 million decrease in recoveries of transmission cost rider carrying costs.  This decrease was partially offset in Retail Margins above. 
                
    An $8 million decrease in recoverable DIR depreciation expense in Ohio. 
                
    A $7 million decrease in recoverable smart grid depreciation expenses.  This decrease was partially offset in Retail Margins above.  
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $7 million increase in depreciation expense due to an increase in depreciable base of transmission and distribution assets. 
                
    A $4 million increase due to amortization of capitalized software costs.   
                
    Taxes Other Than Income Taxes   increased $5 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $12 million increase in property taxes due to additional investments in transmission and distribution assets and higher tax rates.  
     This increase was partially offset by: 
             
    A $7 million decrease in state excise taxes due to a decrease in metered KWh.  This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in Retail Margins above.  
                
    Carrying Costs Income   decreased $16 million primarily due to the impact of a 2016 regulatory deferral of capacity related carrying costs as a result of OPCo's December 2016 Global Settlement. 
                
    Interest     Expense   decreased $10 million primarily due to the maturity of a senior unsecured note in June 2016. 
                
    Income Tax Expense   increased $16 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income, the recording of federal income tax adjustments and consolidated savings from Parent, partially offset by the recording of federal income tax adjustments related to Tax Reform.

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
    
  The management of Ohio Power Company and Subsidiaries (OPCo) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  OPCo s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  Management assessed the effectiveness of OPCo s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2017  .  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013).  Based on management s assessment, management concluded OPCo s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,   2017  . 
    
  This annual report does not include an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, OPCo s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit OPCo to provide only management s report in this annual report.

PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF OKLAHOMA 

144 

PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF OKLAHOMA 
  MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 
    
  As a public utility, PSO engages in the generation and purchase of electric power, and the subsequent sale, transmission and distribution of that power to approximately 551,000 retail customers in its service territory in eastern and southwestern Oklahoma.  PSO sells electric power at wholesale to other utilities, municipalities and electric cooperatives.  PSO shares off-system sales margins with its customers. 
    
  In March 2014, SPP changed from an energy imbalance service market to a fully integrated power market.  Previously, PSO and SWEPCo satisfied their load requirements with their own generation resources or through the Operating Agreement.  In the new integrated power market, PSO and SWEPCo operate as standalone entities and offer their respective generation into the SPP power market.  SPP then economically dispatches the resources. 
    
  AEPSC conducts power, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other risk management activities on PSO s behalf.  PSO shares in the revenues and expenses associated with these risk management activities, as described in the preceding paragraph, with SWEPCo.  Power and natural gas risk management activities are allocated based on the Operating Agreement.  Risk management activities primarily include power and natural gas and physical transactions, financially-settled swaps and exchange-traded futures.  AEPSC settles the majority of the physical forward contracts by entering into offsetting contracts. 
    
  Under the SIA, AEPSC allocates physical and financial revenues and expenses from transactions with neighboring utilities, power marketers and other power and natural gas risk management activities based upon the location of such activity, with margins resulting from trading and marketing activities originating in PJM and MISO generally accruing to the benefit of APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo and trading and marketing activities originating in SPP generally accruing to the benefit of PSO and SWEPCo.  Margins resulting from other transactions are allocated among APCo, I M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo based upon the common shareholder s equity of these companies. 
    
  PSO is jointly and severally liable for activity conducted by AEPSC on the behalf of PSO and SWEPCo related to power purchase and sale activity.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  KWh Sales/Degree Days 

Heating degree days and cooling degree days are metrics commonly used in the utility industry as a measure of the impact of weather on revenues. 

(a) 
    Heating degree days are calculated on a 55 degree temperature base. 
              (b) 
    Normal Heating/Cooling represents the thirty-year average of degree days. 
              (c) 
    Cooling degree days are calculated on a 65 degree temperature base.

2017   Compared to   2016    
    
  Reconciliation of Year Ended December 31,   2016   to Year Ended December 31,   2017    
  Net Income 
  (in millions) 

(a) 
    Includes firm wholesale sales to municipals and cooperatives. 
       
  The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $20 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $22 million increase from base rate increases implemented in 2017 and revenue increases from rate riders. This increase in Retail Margins has corresponding increases to riders/trackers recognized in other expense items below. 
                
    A $16 million increase related to the System Reliability Rider (SRR) that was collected in 2017. The SRR ended in August 2017. 
              These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    An $18 million decrease in weather-related usage primarily due to a 13% decrease in cooling degree days and a 7% decrease in heating degree days.  
                
    Transmission Revenues   increased $5 million primarily due to additional investments in SPP. 
                
    Other Revenues   decreased $6 million primarily due to the elimination of connection charges for certain customers with advanced metering, effective with the implementation of new base rates in January 2017. 

147 

Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $37 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $15 million increase in vegetation management expenses. This increase is partially offset by a corresponding increase in Retail Margins as vegetation management expenses recovered in the prior year under the SRR are now recovered as a component of base rates in the current year. 
                
    A $23 million increase in transmission expenses primarily due to increased SPP transmission services. 
                
    Taxes Other Than Income Taxes   increased $5 million primarily due to an increase in property tax expense. 
                
    Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction   decreased $6 million primarily due to completed environmental projects. 
                
    Income Tax Expense   decreased $4 million primarily due to a decrease in pretax book income, partially offset by the recording of federal income tax adjustments related to Tax Reform, the recording of federal income tax adjustments and by other book/tax differences which are accounted for on a flow-through basis.

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
    
  The management of Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  PSO s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  Management assessed the effectiveness of PSO s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2017  .  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013).  Based on management s assessment, management concluded PSO s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,   2017  . 
    
  This annual report does not include an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, PSO s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit PSO to provide only management s report in this annual report.

SOUTHWESTERN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY CONSOLIDATED 
  MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 
    
  As a public utility, SWEPCo engages in the generation and purchase of electric power, and the subsequent sale, transmission and distribution of that power to approximately 535,000 retail customers in its service territory in northeastern and the panhandle of Texas, northwestern Louisiana and western Arkansas.  SWEPCo consolidates its wholly-owned subsidiary, Southwest Arkansas Utilities Corporation.  SWEPCo also consolidates Sabine Mining Company, a variable interest entity.  SWEPCo sells electric power at wholesale to other utilities, municipalities and electric cooperatives.  SWEPCo shares off-system sales margins with its customers. 
    
  In March 2014, SPP changed from an energy imbalance service market to a fully integrated power market.  Previously, PSO and SWEPCo satisfied their load requirements with their own generation resources or through the Operating Agreement.  In the new integrated power market, PSO and SWEPCo operate as standalone entities and offer their respective generation into the SPP power market.

  Earnings Attributable to SWEPCo Common Shareholder 
  (in millions) 

(a) 
    Includes firm wholesale sales to municipals and cooperatives. 
       
  The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased   $34 million   primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $74 million increase primarily due to rider and base rate revenue increases in Texas and Louisiana, partially offset in various expenses below. 
                
    A $6 million increase due to higher weather-normalized margins. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $27 million decrease in weather-related usage primarily due to a 13% decrease in cooling degree days and a 10% decrease in heating degree days. 
                
    A $13 million decrease in FERC generation wholesale municipal and cooperative revenues primarily due to an annual formula rate true-up. 
                
    An $8 million decrease primarily due to lower fuel cost recovery. 
                
    Margins from Off-system Sales   increased   $4 million   primarily due to higher sales prices. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   decreased   $4 million   primarily due to an accrual for SPP sponsor-funded transmission upgrades.  This decrease was partially offset by a corresponding decrease in Expenses and Other items below. 
                
    Other Revenues   decreased   $5 million   primarily due to the Louisiana Turk Plant Prudence Review settlement accrual of $6 million for revenues earned before 2017. 
     
   161 

Expenses and Other, Income Tax Expense, Equity Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiary and Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses decreased   $23 million   primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $16 million decrease in generation plant expenses. 
                
    A $9 million decrease due to an increase in gain on sale of property in 2017. 
                
    A $7 million decrease in employee-related expenses. 
                
    A $6 million decrease due to a charitable donation to the AEP Foundation in 2016. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $10 million increase due to the Wind Catcher Project. 
                
    A $9 million increase in distribution primarily due to overhead line maintenance. 
                
    Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges   increased   $34 million   due to asset impairments of Turk Plant and Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and other charges related to the Texas base rate case. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses increased   $21 million   primarily due to a higher depreciable base. 
                
    Taxes Other Than Income Taxes   increased   $10 million   primarily due to an increase in property taxes. 
                
    Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction   decreased   $9 million   primarily due to completed environmental projects.  
                
    Interest Expense   increased   $4 million   primarily due to lower AFUDC borrowed funds resulting from completed environmental projects.   
                
    Income Tax Expense   decreased   $4 million   primarily due to income tax benefits attributable to SWEPCo s noncontrolling interest in Sabine and a decrease in pretax book income.  This decrease was offset by the regulatory accounting treatment of state income taxes and other book/tax differences which are accounted for on a flow-through basis. 
                
    Equity Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiary   decreased   $12 million   primarily due to a prior period income tax adjustment for DHLC. 
                
    Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest   increased   $9 million   primarily due to income tax benefits attributable to SWEPCo s noncontrolling interest in Sabine.  This increase was offset by a decrease in Income Tax Expense above.

1.    ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  ORGANIZATION 
    
  The Registrants engage in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power.  The Registrant Subsidiaries that conduct most of these activities are regulated by the FERC under the Federal Power Act and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and maintain accounts in accordance with the FERC and other regulatory guidelines.  Most of these companies are subject to further regulation with regard to rates and other matters by state regulatory commissions. 
    
  AEP provides competitive electric and gas supply for residential, commercial and industrial customers in deregulated electricity markets and also provides energy management solutions throughout the United States, including energy efficiency services through its independent retail electric supplier. 
    
  The Registrants also engage in wholesale electricity, natural gas and other commodity marketing and risk management activities in the United States and provide various energy-related services.  In addition, AEP operates competitive wind and solar farms. I M provides barging services to both affiliated and nonaffiliated companies.  SWEPCo, through consolidated and nonconsolidated affiliates, conducts lignite mining operations to fuel certain of its generation facilities.   
    
  Disposition of AEP River Operations (Applies to AEP) 
    
  In October 2015, AEP signed an agreement to sell its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated third party.  The sale closed in November 2015.  The results of operations of AEPRO have been classified as Discontinued Operations on the statements of income for the prior periods presented.  The transaction was accounted for in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant and Equipment.   Material disclosures within the notes to the financial statements exclude amounts related to Discontinued Operations for all periods presented.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Rates and Service Regulation 
    
  AEP s public utility subsidiaries  rates are regulated by the FERC and state regulatory commissions in the eleven state operating territories in which they operate.  The FERC also regulates the Registrants  affiliated transactions, including AEPSC intercompany service billings which are generally at cost, under the 2005 Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal Power Act.  The FERC also has jurisdiction over the issuances and acquisitions of securities of the public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company.  For non-power goods and services, the FERC requires a nonregulated affiliate to bill an affiliated public utility company at no more than market while a public utility must bill the higher of cost or market to a nonregulated affiliate.  The state regulatory commissions also regulate certain intercompany transactions under various orders and affiliate statutes.  Both the FERC and state regulatory commissions are permitted to review and audit the relevant books and records of companies within a public utility holding company system. 
    
  The FERC regulates wholesale power markets and wholesale power transactions.  The Registrants  wholesale power transactions are generally market-based.  Wholesale power transactions are cost-based regulated when a cost-based contract is negotiated and filed with the FERC or the FERC determines that the Registrants have  market power  in the region where the transaction occurs.  Wholesale power supply contracts have been entered into with various municipalities and cooperatives that are FERC-regulated, cost-based contracts.  These contracts are generally formula rate mechanisms, which are trued up to actual costs annually.   
    
  The state regulatory commissions regulate all of the retail distribution operations and rates of the Registrants  retail public utility subsidiaries on a cost basis.  The state regulatory commissions also regulate the retail generation/power supply operations and rates except in Ohio and the ERCOT region of Texas.  For generation in Ohio, customers who  
  
   173 

have not switched to a CRES provider for generation pay market-based auction rates.  In addition, all OPCo distribution customers pay for certain     deferred generation-related     costs through non-bypassable charges.  In the ERCOT region of Texas, the generation/supply business is under customer choice and market pricing is conducted by REPs.  AEP has no active REPs in ERCOT.  AEP s nonregulated subsidiaries enter into short and long-term wholesale transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in the ERCOT market.  In addition, these nonregulated subsidiaries control certain wind and coal-fired generation assets, the power from which is marketed and sold in ERCOT.   
    
  The FERC also regulates the Registrants  wholesale transmission operations and rates.  Retail transmission rates are based upon the FERC OATT rate when retail rates are unbundled in connection with restructuring.  Retail transmission rates are based on formula rates included in the PJM OATT that are cost-based and are unbundled in Ohio for OPCo, in Virginia for APCo and in Michigan for I M.   AEP Texas  retail transmission rates in Texas are unbundled but the retail transmission rates are regulated, on a cost basis, by the PUCT.  Bundled retail transmission rates are regulated, on a cost basis, by the state commissions.  Transmission rates for AEP s seven wholly-owned transmission subsidiaries within the AEP Transmission Holdco segment are based on formula rates included in the applicable RTO s OATT that are cost-based. 
    
  In West Virginia, APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-service basis.  
    
  In addition, the FERC regulates the SIA, Operating Agreement, Transmission Agreement and Transmission Coordination Agreement, all of which allocate shared system costs and revenues among the utility subsidiaries that are parties to each agreement.  The FERC also regulates the PCA and the Bridge Agreement, see Note   16   - Related Party Transactions for additional information.   
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  AEP s consolidated financial statements include its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs of which AEP is the primary beneficiary.  The consolidated financial statements for AEP Texas include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and Transition Funding (a substantially-controlled VIE).  The consolidated financial statements for APCo include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding (a substantially-controlled VIE).  The consolidated financial statements for I M include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and DCC Fuel (substantially-controlled VIEs).  The consolidated financial statements for OPCo include the Registrant Subsidiary and Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding (a substantially-controlled VIE).  The consolidated financial statements for SWEPCo include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiary and Sabine (a substantially-controlled VIE).  Intercompany items are eliminated in consolidation.   
    
  The equity method of accounting is used for equity investments where the Registrants exercise significant influence but do not hold a controlling financial interest.  Such investments are initially recorded at cost in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets.  The proportionate share of the investee s equity earnings or losses is included in Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on the statements of income.  AEP, AEP Texas, I M, PSO and SWEPCo have ownership interests in generating units that are jointly-owned.  The proportionate share of the operating costs associated with such facilities is included in the income statements and the assets and liabilities are reflected on the balance sheets.  See Note   17     Variable Interest Entities and Note   18     Property, Plant and Equipment. 
    
  Accounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation 
    
  The Registrants  financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated.  In accordance with accounting guidance for  Regulated Operations,  regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and by matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. 
  
   174 

Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  These estimates include, but are not limited to, inventory valuation, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment, unbilled electricity revenue, valuation of long-term energy contracts, the effects of regulation, long-lived asset recovery, storm costs, the effects of contingencies and certain assumptions made in accounting for pension and postretirement benefits.  The estimates and assumptions used are based upon management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements.  Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. 
    
  Accounting for the Impacts of Tax Reform 
  Given the significance of the legislative changes resulting from Tax Reform, the timing of its enactment and the widespread applicability to registrants, the SEC staff recognized the potential challenges faced by registrants when reflecting the effects of Tax Reform in their 2017 financial statements.  Accordingly, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118) in December 2017, which provides for a one year measurement period to complete the accounting for Tax Reform.   
    
  The Registrants have made reasonable estimates for the measurement and accounting for the impacts of Tax Reform and these estimates are reflected in the December 31, 2017 financial statements as provisional amounts.  While the Registrants were able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of Tax Reform, the final impact may differ from the recorded provisional amounts to the extent refinements are made to the estimated cumulative temporary differences or as a result of additional guidance or technical corrections that may be issued by the IRS or regulatory state commissions that impacts management s interpretation and assumptions utilized.  See  Federal Tax Reform  section of Note   12   for additional information.   
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents include temporary cash investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
    
  Restricted Cash (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas, APCo and OPCo) 
    
  Restricted Cash primarily includes funds held by trustees for the payment of securitization bonds. 
    
  Reconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
  The following tables provide a reconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash reported within the balance sheet that sum to the total of the same amounts shown on the statement of cash flows: 

175 

Other Temporary Investments (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Other Temporary Investments include securities available for sale, including marketable securities that management intends to hold for less than one year and investments by its protected cell of EIS. 
    
  Management classifies investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity in accordance with the provisions of  Investments   Debt and Equity Securities  accounting guidance.  AEP does not have any investments classified as trading. 
    
  Available-for-sale securities reflected in Other Temporary Investments are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, reported in AOCI.  Held-to-maturity securities reflected in Other Temporary Investments are carried at amortized cost.  The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification or weighted average cost method. 
    
  In evaluating potential impairment of securities with unrealized losses, management considers, among other criteria, the current fair value compared to cost, the length of time the security s fair value has been below cost, intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value and current economic conditions.  See  Fair Value Measurements of Other Temporary Investments  section of Note   11   for additional information. 
    
  Inventory 
    
  Fossil fuel inventories are carried at average cost with the exception of AGR and AEP s non-regulated ownership share of Oklaunion Plant, which is carried at the lower of average cost or market.  Materials and supplies inventories are carried at average cost. 
    
  Accounts Receivable 
    
  Customer accounts receivable primarily include receivables from wholesale and retail energy customers, receivables from energy contract counterparties related to risk management activities and customer receivables primarily related to other revenue-generating activities. 
    
  Revenue is recognized from electric power sales when power is delivered to customers.  To the extent that deliveries have occurred but a bill has not been issued, the Registrants accrue and recognize, as Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the balance sheets, an estimate of the revenues for energy delivered since the last billing. 
    
  AEP Credit factors accounts receivable on a daily basis, excluding receivables from risk management activities, through purchase agreements with I M, KGPCo, KPCo, OPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and a portion of APCo.  Since APCo does not have regulatory authority to sell accounts receivable in its West Virginia regulatory jurisdiction, only a portion of APCo s accounts receivable are sold to AEP Credit.  AEP Credit has a receivables securitization agreement with bank conduits.  Under the securitization agreement, AEP Credit receives financing from bank conduits for the interest in the billed and unbilled receivables they acquire from affiliated utility subsidiaries.  See  Sale of Receivables   AEP Credit  section of Note   14   for additional information. 
    
  Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts 
    
  Generally, AEP Credit records bad debt expense based upon a 12-month rolling average of bad debt write-offs in proportion to gross accounts receivable purchased from participating AEP subsidiaries.  For receivables related to APCo s West Virginia operations, the bad debt reserve is calculated based on a rolling two-year average write-off in proportion to gross accounts receivable.  For customer accounts receivables relating to risk management activities, accounts receivables are reviewed for bad debt reserves at a specific counterparty level basis.  For AEP Texas, bad debt reserves are calculated using the specific identification of receivable balances greater than 120 days delinquent, and for those balances less than 120 days where the collection is doubtful.  For miscellaneous accounts receivable, bad debt expense is recorded for all amounts outstanding 180 days or greater at 100%, unless specifically identified.  Miscellaneous accounts receivable items open less than 180 days may be reserved using specific identification for bad debt reserves. 
  
   176 

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries) 
    
  APCo, I M, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo do not have any significant customers that comprise 10% or more of their operating revenues.  AEP Texas had significant customers which on a combined basis account for the following percentages of Total Revenues for the years ended December 31 and Accounts Receivable   Customers as of December 31: 

(a) 
    Just Energy did not meet the Total Revenue threshold of   10%   in order to be considered a significant customer. 
       
  AEPTCo had significant transactions with AEP Subsidiaries which on a combined basis account for the following percentages of Total Revenues for the years ended December 31 and Total Accounts Receivable as of December 31: 

The Registrant Subsidiaries monitor credit levels and the financial condition of their customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk.  The regulatory commissions allow recovery in rates for a reasonable level of bad debt costs.  Management believes adequate provisions for credit loss have been made in the accompanying Registrant Subsidiary financial statements. 
    
  Emission Allowances and Renewable Energy Credits (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo) 
    
  In regulated jurisdictions, the Registrants record emission allowances and renewable energy credits (RECs) at cost, including the annual SO   2    and NO   x    emission allowance entitlements received at no cost from the Federal EPA.  For AEP s competitive generation business, management records allowances and RECs at the lower of cost or market.  The Registrants follow the inventory model for these allowances and RECs.  Allowances and RECs expected to be consumed within one year are reported in Materials and Supplies on the balance sheets.  Allowances and RECs with expected consumption beyond one year are included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets.  The purchases and sales of allowances and RECs are reported in the Operating Activities section of the statements of cash flows.  Allowances are consumed in the production of energy, and RECs are consumed to meet applicable state renewable portfolio standards and are recorded in Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation at an average cost on the statements of income.  The net margin on sales of emission allowances is included in Vertically Integrated Utilities Revenues on AEP s statements of income and in Electric Generation, Transmission and Distribution Revenues because of its integral nature to the production process of energy and the Registrants  revenue optimization strategy for their operations.  The net margin on sales of emission allowances and RECs affects the determination of deferred fuel or deferred emission allowance and REC costs and the amortization of regulatory assets for certain jurisdictions. 
    
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
    
  Regulated 
    
  Electric utility property, plant and equipment for rate-regulated operations are stated at original cost.  Additions, major replacements and betterments are added to the plant accounts.  Under the group composite method of depreciation, continuous interim routine replacements of items such as boiler tubes, pumps, motors, etc. result in original cost retirements, less salvage, being charged to accumulated depreciation.  The group composite method of depreciation  
  
   177 

assumes that on average, asset components are retired at the end of their useful lives and thus there is no gain or loss.  The equipment in each primary electric plant account is identified as a separate group.  The depreciation rates that are established take into account the past history of interim capital replacements and the amount of removal cost incurred and salvage received.  These rates and the related lives are subject to periodic review.  Removal costs accrued are typically recorded as regulatory liabilities when the revenue received for removal costs accrued exceeds actual removal costs incurred.  The asset removal costs liability is relieved as removal costs are incurred.  A regulatory asset balance will occur if actual removal costs incurred exceed accumulated removal costs accrued. 
    
  The costs of labor, materials and overhead incurred to operate and maintain plant and equipment are included in operating expenses. 
    
  Nuclear fuel, including nuclear fuel in the fabrication phase, is included in Other Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheet. 
    
  Long-lived assets are required to be tested for impairment when it is determined that the carrying value of the assets may no longer be recoverable or when the assets meet the held-for-sale criteria under the accounting guidance for  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.   When it becomes probable that an asset in service or an asset under construction will be abandoned and regulatory cost recovery has been disallowed or is not probable, the cost of that asset shall be removed from plant-in-service or CWIP and charged to expense. 
    
  The fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, as opposed to a forced or liquidation sale.  Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available.  In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow analysis and appraisals. 
    
  Nonregulated 
    
  Nonregulated operations generally follow the policies of rate-regulated operations listed above but with the following exceptions.  Property, plant and equipment of nonregulated operations are stated at original cost (or as adjusted for any applicable impairments) plus the original cost of property acquired or constructed since the acquisition, less disposals.  Normal and routine retirements from the plant accounts, net of salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation for most nonregulated operations under the group composite method of depreciation.  A gain or loss would be recorded if the retirement is not considered an interim routine replacement.  Removal costs are charged to expense. 
    
  Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalization 
    
  For regulated operations, AFUDC represents the estimated cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction projects that is capitalized and recovered through depreciation over the service life of regulated electric utility plant.  The Registrants record the equity component of AFUDC in Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction and the debt component of AFUDC as a reduction to Interest Expense.  For nonregulated operations, including certain generating assets, interest is capitalized during construction in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Capitalization of Interest.  
    
  Valuation of Nonderivative Financial Instruments 
    
  The book values of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Advances to/from Affiliates, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Short-term Debt approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.  The book value of the pre-April 1983 spent nuclear fuel disposal liability approximates the best estimate of its fair value. 

178 

Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo) 
    
  The accounting guidance for  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).  Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2.  When quoted market prices are not available, pricing may be completed using comparable securities, dealer values, operating data and general market conditions to determine fair value.  Valuation models utilize various inputs such as commodity, interest rate and, to a lesser degree, volatility and credit that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, market corroborated inputs (i.e. inputs derived principally from, or correlated to, observable market data) and other observable inputs for the asset or liability. 
    
  For commercial activities, exchange traded derivatives, namely futures contracts, are generally fair valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.  Level 2 inputs primarily consist of OTC broker quotes in moderately active or less active markets, as well as exchange traded contracts where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in Level 1.  Management verifies price curves using these broker quotes and classifies these fair values within Level 2 when substantially all of the fair value can be corroborated.  Management typically obtains multiple broker quotes, which are nonbinding in nature but are based on recent trades in the marketplace.  When multiple broker quotes are obtained, the quoted bid and ask prices are averaged.  In certain circumstances, a broker quote may be discarded if it is a clear outlier.  Management uses a historical correlation analysis between the broker quoted location and the illiquid locations.  If the points are highly correlated, these locations are included within Level 2 as well.  Certain OTC and bilaterally executed derivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information.  Illiquid transactions, complex structured transactions, FTRs and counterparty credit risk may require nonmarket based inputs.  Some of these inputs may be internally developed or extrapolated and utilized to estimate fair value.  When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized as Level 3.  The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3 is the inability to substantiate energy price curves in the market.  A portion of the Level 3 instruments have been economically hedged which limits potential earnings volatility. 
    
  AEP utilizes its trustee s external pricing service to estimate the fair value of the underlying investments held in the benefit plan and nuclear trusts.  AEP s investment managers review and validate the prices utilized by the trustee to determine fair value.  AEP s management performs its own valuation testing to verify the fair values of the securities.  AEP receives audit reports of the trustee s operating controls and valuation processes.  The trustee uses multiple pricing vendors for the assets held in the trusts. 
    
  Assets in the benefits and nuclear trusts, cash and cash equivalents, other temporary investments and restricted cash for securitized funding are classified using the following methods.  Equities are classified as Level 1 holdings if they are actively traded on exchanges.  Items classified as Level 1 are investments in money market funds, fixed income and equity mutual funds and domestic equity securities.  They are valued based on observable inputs, primarily unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  Items classified as Level 2 are primarily investments in individual fixed income securities.  Fixed income securities generally do not trade on exchanges and do not have an official closing price but their valuation inputs are based on observable market data.  Pricing vendors calculate bond valuations using financial models and matrices.  The models use observable inputs including yields on benchmark securities, quotes by securities brokers, rating agency actions, discounts or premiums on securities compared to par prices, changes in yields for U.S. Treasury securities, corporate actions by bond issuers, prepayment schedules and histories, economic events and, for certain securities, adjustments to yields to reflect changes in the rate of inflation.  Other securities with model-derived valuation inputs that are observable are also classified as Level 2 investments.  Investments with unobservable valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 investments.  Investments classified as Other are valued using Net Asset Value as a practical expedient.  Items classified as Other are primarily cash equivalent funds, common collective trusts, commingled funds, structured products, real estate, infrastructure and alternative credit investments.  These investments do not have a readily determinable fair value or they contain redemption restrictions which may include the right to suspend redemptions under certain circumstances.  Redemption restrictions may also prevent certain investments from being redeemed at the reporting date for the underlying value. 
  
   179 

Deferred Fuel Costs (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo) 
    
  The cost of fuel and related emission allowances and emission control chemicals/consumables is charged to Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expense when the fuel is burned or the allowance or consumable is utilized.  The cost of fuel also includes the cost of nuclear fuel burned which is computed primarily on the units-of-production method.  In regulated jurisdictions with an active FAC, fuel cost over-recoveries (the excess of fuel-related revenues over applicable fuel costs incurred) are generally deferred as current regulatory liabilities and under-recoveries (the excess of applicable fuel costs incurred over fuel-related revenues) are generally deferred as current regulatory assets.  Fuel cost over-recovery and under-recovery balances are classified as noncurrent when there is a phase-in plan or the FAC has been suspended.  These deferrals are amortized when refunded or when billed to customers in later months with the state regulatory commissions  review and approval.  The amount of an over-recovery or under-recovery can also be affected by actions of the state regulatory commissions.  On a routine basis, state regulatory commissions review and/or audit the Registrants  fuel procurement policies and practices, the fuel cost calculations and FAC deferrals.  FAC deferrals are adjusted when costs are no longer probable of recovery or when refunds of fuel reserves are probable. 
    
  Changes in fuel costs, including purchased power in Kentucky for KPCo, Indiana and Michigan for I M, in Ohio (through the ESP related to standard service offer load served through auctions) for OPCo, in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas for SWEPCo, in Oklahoma for PSO, in Virginia and West Virginia for APCo and in West Virginia for WPCo are reflected in rates in a timely manner generally through the FAC.  In Ohio, changes in fuel costs and purchased power costs, incurred from 2009 through 2011, continue to be recovered in rider rates that will terminate in December 2018.  The FAC generally includes some sharing of off-system sales margins.  In West Virginia for APCo and WPCo, all of the non-merchant margins from off-system sales are given to customers through the FAC.  A portion of margins from off-system sales are given to customers through the FAC and other rate mechanisms in Oklahoma for PSO, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas for SWEPCo, Kentucky for KPCo, Virginia for APCo and in Indiana and Michigan for I M.  Where the FAC or off-system sales sharing mechanism is capped, frozen or non-existent, changes in fuel costs or sharing of off-system sales impact earnings. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Regulatory Accounting 
    
  The Registrants  financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that can result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated.  Regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and by matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. 
    
  When regulatory assets are probable of recovery through regulated rates, assets are recorded on the balance sheets.  Regulatory assets are tested for probability of recovery at each balance sheet date or whenever new events occur.  Examples of new events include the issuance of a regulatory commission order or passage of new legislation.  If it is determined that recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, the regulatory asset is written off as a charge against income. 
    
  Electricity Supply and Delivery Activities 
    
  The Registrants recognize revenues from retail and wholesale electricity sales and electricity transmission and distribution delivery services.  The Registrants recognize the revenues on the statements of income upon delivery of the energy to the customer and include unbilled as well as billed amounts.  In accordance with the applicable state commission regulatory treatment, PSO and SWEPCo do not record the fuel portion of unbilled revenue.  Wholesale transmission revenue is based on FERC approved formula rate filings made for each calendar year using estimated costs.  The annual rate filing is compared to actual costs with an over- or under-recovery being trued-up with interest and refunded or recovered in a future year s rates.  In accordance with the accounting guidance for  Regulated Operations - Revenue Recognition , the Registrants recognize revenue and expense related to the rate true-ups immediately following the annual FERC filings.  Any portion of the true-ups applicable to an affiliated company is  
  
   180 

recorded as Accounts Receivable - Affiliated Companies or Accounts Payable - Affiliated Companies on the balance sheets.  Any portion of the true-ups applicable to third parties is recorded as Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the balance sheets. 
    
  Most of the power produced at the generation plants is sold to PJM or SPP.  The Registrants also purchase power from PJM and SPP to supply power to customers.  Generally, these power sales and purchases are reported on a net basis as revenues on the statements of income.  However, purchases of power in excess of sales to PJM or SPP, on an hourly net basis, used to serve retail load are recorded gross as Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income.  With the exception of certain dedicated load bilateral power supply contracts, the transactions of AEP s nonregulated subsidiaries are reported as gross purchases or sales. 
    
  Physical energy purchases arising from non-derivative contracts are accounted for on a gross basis in Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income.  Energy purchases arising from non-trading derivative contracts are recorded based on the transaction s facts and circumstances.  Purchases under non-trading derivatives used to serve accrual based obligations are recorded in Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income.  All other non-trading derivative purchases are recorded net in revenues. 
    
  In general, the Registrants record expenses when purchased electricity is received and when expenses are incurred, with the exception of certain power purchase contracts that are derivatives and accounted for using MTM accounting where generation/supply rates are not cost-based regulated.  In jurisdictions where the generation/supply business is subject to cost-based regulation, the unrealized MTM amounts are deferred as regulatory assets (for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains). 
    
  Energy Marketing and Risk Management Activities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo) 
    
  The Registrants engage in power, capacity and, to a lesser extent, natural gas marketing as major power producers and participants in electricity and natural gas markets.  The Registrants also engage in power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity risk management activities focused on markets where the AEP System owns assets and adjacent markets.  These activities include the purchase-and-sale of energy under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices.  These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and options.  Certain energy marketing and risk management transactions are with RTOs. 
    
  The Registrants recognize revenues and expenses from marketing and risk management transactions that are not derivatives upon delivery of the commodity.  The Registrants use MTM accounting for marketing and risk management transactions that are derivatives unless the derivative is designated in a qualifying cash flow hedge relationship or elected normal under the normal purchase normal sale election.  The Registrants include realized gains and losses on marketing and risk management transactions in revenues or expense based on the transaction s facts and circumstances.  In certain jurisdictions subject to cost-based regulation, unrealized MTM amounts and some realized gains and losses are deferred as regulatory assets (for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains).  Unrealized MTM gains and losses are included on the balance sheets as Risk Management Assets or Liabilities as appropriate. 
    
  Certain qualifying marketing and risk management derivatives transactions are designated as hedges of variability in future cash flows as a result of forecasted transactions (cash flow hedge).  In the event the Registrants designate a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the cash flow hedge s gain or loss is initially recorded as a component of AOCI.  When the forecasted transaction is realized and affects net income, the Registrants subsequently reclassify the gain or loss on the hedge from AOCI into revenues or expenses within the same financial statement line item as the forecasted transaction on their statements of income.  In regulated jurisdictions, the ineffective portion is deferred as regulatory assets (for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains).  See  Accounting for Cash Flow Hedging Strategies  section of Note   10  . 

181 

Levelization of Nuclear Refueling Outage Costs (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  In accordance with regulatory orders, I M defers incremental operation and maintenance costs associated with periodic refueling outages at its Cook Plant and amortizes the costs over the period beginning with the month following the start of each unit s refueling outage and lasting until the end of the month in which the same unit s next scheduled refueling outage begins.   
    
  Maintenance 
    
  The Registrants expense maintenance costs as incurred.  If it becomes probable that the Registrants will recover specifically-incurred costs through future rates, a regulatory asset is established to match the expensing of those maintenance costs with their recovery in cost-based regulated revenues.  In certain regulated jurisdictions, the Registrants defer costs above the level included in base rates and amortize those deferrals commensurate with recovery through rate riders. 
    
  Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits 
    
  The Registrants use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities which will result in a future tax consequence.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The Registrants revalued deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate of 21% in December 2017.  See Note   12   for additional information related to Tax Reform. 
    
  When the flow-through method of accounting for temporary differences is required by a regulator to be reflected in regulated revenues (that is, when deferred taxes are not included in the cost of service for determining regulated rates for electricity), deferred income taxes are recorded and related regulatory assets and liabilities are established to match the regulated revenues and tax expense. 
    
  Investment tax credits (ITC) were historically accounted for under the flow-through method, except where regulatory commissions reflected ITC in the rate-making process.  In 2016, AEP and subsidiaries changed accounting for the recognition of ITC and elected to apply the preferred deferral methodology.  Retrospective application is not necessary for reporting periods prior to 2016 as the financial impact to AEP and subsidiaries was immaterial. 
    
  Deferred ITC is amortized to income tax expense over the life of the asset.  Amortization of deferred ITC begins when the asset is placed into service, except where regulatory commissions reflect ITC in the rate-making process, then amortization begins when the cash tax benefit is recognized. 
    
  The Registrants account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Income Taxes.   The Registrants classify interest expense or income related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense or income as appropriate and classify penalties as Other Operation expense. 
    
  Excise Taxes (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo) 
    
  As agents for some state and local governments, the Registrants collect from customers certain excise taxes levied by those state or local governments on customers.  The Registrants do not record these taxes as revenue or expense. 
    
  Debt 
    
  Gains and losses from the reacquisition of debt used to finance regulated electric utility plants are deferred and amortized over the remaining term of the reacquired debt in accordance with their rate-making treatment unless the debt is refinanced.  If the reacquired debt associated with the regulated business is refinanced, the reacquisition costs attributable to the portions of the business that are subject to cost-based regulatory accounting are generally deferred and amortized over the term of the replacement debt consistent with its recovery in rates.  Operations not subject to cost-based rate regulation report gains and losses on the reacquisition of debt in Interest Expense on the statements of income upon reacquisition. 
  
   182 

Debt discount or premium and debt issuance expenses are deferred and amortized generally utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related debt.  The straight-line method approximates the effective interest method and is consistent with the treatment in rates for regulated operations.  The net amortization expense is included in Interest Expense on the statements of income. 
    
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Applies to AEP) 
    
  When AEP acquires businesses, management records the fair value of all assets and liabilities, including intangible assets.  To the extent that consideration exceeds the fair value of identified assets, goodwill is recorded.  Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized.  Management tests acquired goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually at their estimated fair value.  Management tests goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangibles at the asset level.  Fair value is the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available.  In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, management estimates fair value using various internal and external valuation methods.  AEP amortizes intangible assets with finite lives over their respective estimated lives to their estimated residual values.  Management also reviews the lives of the amortizable intangibles with finite lives on an annual basis. 
    
  Pension and OPEB Plans (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo) 
    
  AEP sponsors a qualified pension plan and two unfunded nonqualified pension plans.  Substantially all AEP employees are covered by the qualified plan or both the qualified and a nonqualified pension plan.  AEP also sponsors OPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees.  The Registrant Subsidiaries account for their participation in the AEP sponsored pension and OPEB plans using multiple-employer accounting.  See Note   8   - Benefit Plans for additional information including significant accounting policies associated with the plans. 
    
  Investments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo) 
    
  AEP has several trust funds with significant investments intended to provide for future payments of pension and OPEB benefits, nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal.  All of the trust funds  investments are diversified and managed in compliance with all laws and regulations.  The investment strategy for the trust funds is to use a diversified portfolio of investments to achieve an acceptable rate of return while managing the investment risk of the assets relative to the associated liabilities.  To minimize investment risk, the trust funds are broadly diversified among classes of assets, investment strategies and investment managers.  Management regularly reviews the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalances the investments to targeted allocations when appropriate.  Investment policies and guidelines allow investment managers in approved strategies to use financial derivatives to obtain or manage market exposures and to hedge assets and liabilities.  The investments are reported at fair value under the  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  accounting guidance. 
    
  Benefit Plans 
    
  All benefit plan assets are invested in accordance with each plan s investment policy.  The investment policy outlines the investment objectives, strategies and target asset allocations by plan. 
    
  The investment philosophies for AEP s benefit plans support the allocation of assets to minimize risks and optimize net returns.  Strategies used include: 

Maintaining a long-term investment horizon. 
                
    Diversifying assets to help control volatility of returns at acceptable levels. 
                
    Managing fees, transaction costs and tax liabilities to maximize investment earnings. 
                
    Using active management of investments where appropriate risk/return opportunities exist. 
                
    Keeping portfolio structure style-neutral to limit volatility compared to applicable benchmarks. 
                
    Using alternative asset classes such as real estate and private equity to maximize return and provide additional portfolio diversification. 

183 

The objective of the investment policy for the pension fund is to maintain the funded status of the plan while providing for growth in the plan assets to offset the growth in the plan liabilities.  The current target asset allocations are as follows: 
                     Pension Plan Assets 
      
    Target

The investment policy for each benefit plan contains various investment limitations.  The investment policies establish concentration limits for securities and prohibit the purchase of securities issued by AEP (with the exception of proportionate and immaterial holdings of AEP securities in passive index strategies).  However, the investment policies do not preclude the benefit trust funds from receiving contributions in the form of AEP securities, provided that the AEP securities acquired by each plan may not exceed the limitations imposed by law. 
    
  For equity investments, the concentration limits are as follows: 

No security in excess of 5% of all equities.  
                
    Cash equivalents must be less than 10% of an investment manager s equity portfolio.  
                
    No individual stock may be more than 10% and 7% for pension and OPEB investments, respectively, of each manager s equity portfolio.  
                
    No investment in excess of 5% of an outstanding class of any company.  
                
    No securities may be bought or sold on margin or other use of leverage.  
       
  For fixed income investments, each investment manager s portfolio is compared to investment grade, diversified long and intermediate benchmark indices. 
    
  A portion of the pension assets is invested in real estate funds to provide diversification, add return and hedge against inflation.  Real estate properties are illiquid, difficult to value and not actively traded.  The pension plan uses external real estate investment managers to invest in commingled funds that hold real estate properties.  To mitigate investment risk in the real estate portfolio, commingled real estate funds are used to ensure that holdings are diversified by region, property type and risk classification.  Real estate holdings include core, value-added and opportunistic classifications and some investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts, which are publicly traded real estate securities. 
    
  A portion of the pension assets is invested in private equity.  Private equity investments add return and provide diversification and typically require a long-term time horizon to evaluate investment performance.  Private equity is classified as an alternative investment because it is illiquid, difficult to value and not actively traded.  The pension plan uses limited partnerships and commingled funds to invest across the private equity investment spectrum.   The private equity holdings are with multiple general partners who help monitor the investments and provide investment selection expertise.  The holdings are currently comprised of venture capital, buyout and hybrid debt and equity investment instruments.   
    
  AEP participates in a securities lending program with BNY Mellon to provide incremental income on idle assets and to provide income to offset custody fees and other administrative expenses.  AEP lends securities to borrowers approved by BNY Mellon in exchange for collateral.  All loans are collateralized by at least 102% of the loaned asset s market value and the collateral is invested.  The difference between the rebate owed to the borrower and the collateral rate of return determines the earnings on the loaned security.  The securities lending program s objective is to provide modest incremental income with a limited increase in risk. 
  
   184 

Trust owned life insurance (TOLI) underwritten by The Prudential Insurance Company is held in the OPEB plan trusts.  The strategy for holding life insurance contracts in the taxable Voluntary Employees  Beneficiary Association  trust is to minimize taxes paid on the asset growth in the trust.  Earnings on plan assets are tax-deferred within the TOLI contract and can be tax-free if held until claims are paid.  Life insurance proceeds remain in the trust and are used to fund future retiree medical benefit liabilities.  With consideration to other investments held in the trust, the cash value of the TOLI contracts is invested in   two   diversified funds.  A portion is invested in a commingled fund with underlying investments in stocks that are actively traded on major international equity exchanges.  The other portion of the TOLI cash value is invested in a diversified, commingled fixed income fund with underlying investments in government bonds, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents are held in each trust to provide liquidity and meet short-term cash needs.  Cash equivalent funds are used to provide diversification and preserve principal.  The underlying holdings in the cash funds are investment grade money market instruments including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, treasury bills and other types of investment grade short-term debt securities.  The cash funds are valued each business day and provide daily liquidity. 
    
  Nuclear Trust Funds (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  Nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel trust funds represent funds that regulatory commissions allow I M to collect through rates to fund future decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal liabilities.  By rules or orders, the IURC, the MPSC and the FERC established investment limitations and general risk management guidelines.  In general, limitations include: 

Acceptable investments (rated investment grade or above when purchased). 
                
    Maximum percentage invested in a specific type of investment. 
                
    Prohibition of investment in obligations of AEP, I M or their affiliates. 
                
    Withdrawals permitted only for payment of decommissioning costs and trust expenses. 
       
  I M maintains trust funds for each regulatory jurisdiction.  Regulatory approval is required to withdraw decommissioning funds.  These funds are managed by external investment managers who must comply with the guidelines and rules of the applicable regulatory authorities.  The trust assets are invested to optimize the net of tax earnings of the trust giving consideration to liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives. 
    
  I M records securities held in these trust funds in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on its balance sheets.  I M records these securities at fair value.  I M classifies securities in the trust funds as available-for-sale due to their long-term purpose.  Other-than-temporary impairments for investments in both debt and equity securities are considered realized losses as a result of securities being managed by an external investment management firm.  The external investment management firm makes specific investment decisions regarding the debt and equity investments held in these trusts and generally intends to sell debt securities in an unrealized loss position as part of a tax optimization strategy.  Impairments reduce the cost basis of the securities which will affect any future unrealized gain or realized gain or loss due to the adjusted cost of investment.  I M records unrealized gains and other-than-temporary impairments from securities in these trust funds as adjustments to the regulatory liability account for the nuclear decommissioning trust funds and to regulatory assets or liabilities for the SNF disposal trust funds in accordance with their treatment in rates.  Consequently, changes in fair value of trust assets do not affect earnings or AOCI.  See the  Nuclear Contingencies  section of Note   6   for additional discussion of nuclear matters.  See  Fair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal  section of Note   11   for disclosure of the fair value of assets within the trusts. 
    
  Comprehensive Income     (Loss) (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo) 
    
  Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources.  It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.  Comprehensive income (loss) has two components: net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). 

185 

Stock-Based Compensation Plans  
    
  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP had performance units and restricted stock units outstanding under the American Electric Power System 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2015 LTIP).  Upon vesting, performance units awarded prior to 2017 are settled in cash and restricted stock units are settled in AEP common shares, except for restricted stock units granted after January 1, 2013 and prior to January 1, 2017 that vest to executive officers, which are settled in cash.  All performance units and restricted stock units awarded after January 1, 2017 will be settled in AEP common shares.  The impact of AEP s stock-based compensation plans are insignificant to the financial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries.  
    
  AEP maintains a variety of tax qualified and nonqualified deferred compensation plans for employees and non-employee directors that include, among other options, an investment in or an investment return equivalent to that of AEP common stock.  This includes AEP career shares maintained under the American Electric Power System Stock Ownership Requirement Plan (SORP), which facilitates executives in meeting minimum stock ownership requirements assigned to them by the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors.  AEP career shares are derived from vested performance units granted to employees under the 2015 LTIP.  AEP career shares are equal in value to shares of AEP common stock and become payable to executives after their service ends.  AEP career shares accrue additional dividend shares in an amount equal to dividends paid on AEP common shares at the closing market price on the dividend payments date.  In 2017 the SORP was changed to provide all future AEP career share payments to be made in AEP common stock, rather than cash. 
    
  Performance units awarded after January 1, 2017 are classified as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet.  These awards may be settled in cash upon an employee s qualifying termination due to a change in control.  Because such event is not solely within the control of the company, these awards are classified outside of permanent equity. 
    
  AEP compensates their non-employee directors, in part, with stock units under the American Electric Power Company, Inc.  Stock Unit Accumulation Plan for Non-Employee Directors.  These stock units become payable in cash to directors after their service ends. 
    
  Management measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.  For share-based payment awards with service only vesting conditions, management recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis.  Stock-based compensation expense recognized on the statements of income for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   is based on the number of outstanding awards at the end of each period without a reduction for estimated forfeitures.  AEP accounts for forfeitures in the period in which they occur. 
    
  For the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , compensation cost is included in Net Income for the performance units, career shares, restricted stock units and the non-employee director s stock units.  Compensation cost may also be capitalized.  See Note   15   for additional information. 

186 

Equity Investment of Unconsolidated Affiliates (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
    
  AEP includes equity in earnings from equity method investments in Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on the statements of income.  SWEPCo includes equity in earnings from an equity method investment in Equity Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiary on the statements of income.  AEP and SWEPCo regularly monitor and evaluate equity method investments to determine whether they are impaired.  An impairment is recorded when the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary in nature. 
    
  AEP has   two   significant equity method investments, ETT and DHLC. ETT designs, acquires, constructs, owns and operates certain transmission facilities in ERCOT.  Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a nonaffiliated entity, holds a   50%   membership interest in ETT, AEP Transmission Holdco holds a   49.5%   membership interest in ETT and AEP Transmission Partner holds the remaining   0.5%   membership interest in ETT.  As a result, AEP, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, holds a   50%   membership interest in ETT.  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP s investment in ETT was   $664   million which is included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets.  AEP s equity earnings associated with ETT were   $82   million for the year ended December 31,   2017  .  See  Non-Consolidated Significant Variable Interest  section of Note   17   for more information about DHLC. 
    
  Earnings Per Share (EPS) (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding common shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. 
    
  The following table presents AEP s basic and diluted EPS calculations included on the statements of income: 

There were   no   antidilutive shares outstanding as of December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  .

2  .    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  During FASB s standard-setting process and upon issuance of final pronouncements, management reviews the new accounting literature to determine its relevance, if any, to the Registrants  business.  The following pronouncements will impact the financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (ASU 2014-09) 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 changing the method used to determine the timing and requirements for revenue recognition on the statements of income.  Under the new standard, an entity must identify the performance obligations in a contract, determine the transaction price and allocate the price to specific performance obligations to recognize the revenue when the obligation is completed.  The amendments in this update also require disclosure of sufficient information to allow users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contracts. 
    
  The FASB deferred implementation of ASU 2014-09 under the terms in ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic: 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.   The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. 
    
  Management analyzed the impact of the new revenue standard and related ASUs.  During 2016 and 2017, revenue contract assessments were completed.  Material revenue streams were identified within the AEP System and representative contract/transaction types were sampled.  Performance obligations identified within each material revenue stream were evaluated to determine whether the obligations were satisfied at a point in time or over time.  Contracts determined to be satisfied over time generally qualified for the invoicing practical expedient since the invoiced amounts reasonably represented the value to customers of performance obligations fulfilled to date.  Additionally, the new standard did not give rise to any changes in current accounting systems.  Management continues to develop disclosures to comply with the requirements of ASU 2014-09, including disclosures of significant disaggregated revenue streams, and information about fixed performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of the end of a reporting period.  
    
  Management adopted ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018, by means of the modified retrospective approach.  The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Management will continue to actively participate in informal industry forums throughout the period of initial adoption.  
    
  ASU 2016-01  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  (ASU 2016-01) 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 revising the reporting model for financial instruments.  Under the new standard, equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  For equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, entities are permitted to elect a practicality exception and measure the investment at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes.  The new standard also amends disclosure requirements and requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheets or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  The amendments also clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for certain provisions.  Management adopted ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018, by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet.  The adoption of ASU 2016-01 resulted in an immaterial impact on results of operations and financial position of AEP, and no impact to results of operations or financial position of the Registrant Subsidiaries.  There was no impact on cash flows of the Registrants.

ASU 2016-02  Accounting for Leases  (ASU 2016-02) 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 increasing the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheets and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  Under the new standard, an entity must recognize an asset and liability for operating leases on the balance sheets.  Additionally, a capital lease will be known as a finance lease going forward.  Leases with lease terms of 12 months or longer will be subject to the new requirements.  Fundamentally, the criteria used to determine lease classification will remain the same, but will be more subjective under the new standard. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The guidance will be applied by means of a modified retrospective approach.  The modified retrospective approach will require lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented; however, the FASB is currently evaluating whether to provide reporting entities with an additional expedient to adopt the new lease requirements through a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption.  Accordingly, management continues to monitor these standard-setting activities that may impact the transition requirements of the lease standard. 
    
  Management continues to analyze the impact of the new lease standard.  During 2016 and 2017, lease contract assessments were completed.  The AEP System lease population was identified and representative lease contracts were sampled.  Based upon the completed assessments, management prepared a system gap analysis to outline new disclosure compliance requirements compared to current system capabilities.  Multiple lease system options were also evaluated.  Management plans to elect certain of the following practical expedients upon adoption: 
                   Practical Expedient 
      
    Description 
      Overall Expedients (for leases commenced prior to adoption date and must be adopted as a package) 
      
    Do not need to reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are/or contain leases, do not need to reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and do not need to reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. 
      Lease and Non-lease Components (elect by class of underlying asset) 
      
    Elect as an accounting policy to not separate non-lease components from lease components and instead account for each lease and associated non-lease component as a single lease component. 
      Short-term Lease (elect by class of underlying asset) 
      
    Elect as an accounting policy to not apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases. 
      Lease term 
      
    Elect to use hindsight to determine the lease term. 

Evaluation of new lease contracts continues and the process of implementing a compliant lease system solution began in the third quarter of 2017.  Management expects the new standard to impact financial position and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact.  Management expects no impact to results of operations or cash flows.  
    
  Management continues to monitor unresolved industry implementation issues, including items related to easements and right-of-ways, and will analyze the related impacts to lease accounting.  In this regard, to address stakeholder concerns about the costs and complexity of complying with the transition provisions of the new lease standard, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01 in January 2018.  This ASU provides an optional transition practical expedient that allows companies to exclude in their evaluation of Topic 842 existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under Topic 840, which reduces the volume of contracts requiring evaluation.  Management intends to elect this practical expedient upon adoption of ASU 2016-02. 
    
  Management continues to monitor FASB s ongoing standard-setting activities that may result in the issuance of additional targeted improvements to the new lease guidance.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019.

ASU 2016-09  Compensation   Stock Compensation  (ASU 2016-09) 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 simplifying the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows.  Under the new standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the statements of income.  Under previous GAAP, excess tax benefits are recognized in additional paid-in capital while tax deficiencies are recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits, if any, or on the statements of income. 
    
  Management adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017.  As a result of the adoption of this guidance, management made an accounting policy election to recognize the effect of forfeitures in compensation cost when they occur.  There was an immaterial impact on results of operations and financial position and no impact on cash flows at adoption. 
    
  ASU 2016-13  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  (ASU 2016-13) 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 requiring an allowance to be recorded for all expected credit losses for financial assets.  The allowance for credit losses is based on historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The new standard also makes revisions to the other than temporary impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities.  Disclosures of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables are further disaggregated by year of origination. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The amendments will be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption on net income.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020. 
    
  ASU 2016-18  Restricted Cash  (ASU 2016-18) 
    
  In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 clarifying the treatment of restricted cash on the statements of cash flows.  Under the new standard, amounts considered restricted cash will be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts on the statements of cash flows. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  Management adopted ASU 2016-18 for the 2017 Annual Report and applied the new standard retrospectively for all periods presented.  See the  Restricted Cash  section of Note   1   for the effect of adoption on cash flows for each Registrant. 
    
  ASU 2017-07  Compensation - Retirement Benefits  (ASU 2017-07) 
    
  In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07 requiring that an employer report the service cost component of pension and postretirement benefits in the same line item or items as other compensation costs.  The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the statements of income separately from the service cost component and outside of a subtotal of income from operations.  In addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization as applicable following labor.  For 2017, AEP s actual non-service cost components were a credit of   $72 million  , of which approximately   41%   was capitalized. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance.  Management adopted ASU 2017-07 effective January 1, 2018.  
  
   191 

ASU 2017-12  Derivatives and Hedging  (ASU 2017-12) 
    
  In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 amending the recognition and presentation requirements for hedge accounting activities.  The objectives are to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity s risk management activities in its financial statements and reduce the complexity of applying hedge accounting.  Under the new standard, the concept of recognizing hedge ineffectiveness within the statements of income for cash flow hedges, which has historically been immaterial to AEP, will be eliminated.  In addition, certain required tabular disclosures relating to fair value and cash flow hedges will be modified. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted for any interim or annual period after August 2017.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard, including the possibility of early adoption, and at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption on results of operations, financial position or cash flows.   
    
  ASU 2018-02  Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from AOCI  (ASU 2018-02) 
    
  In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 allowing a reclassification from AOCI to Retained Earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from Tax Reform.  Under existing accounting guidance for  Income Taxes , deferred tax assets and liabilities must be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates with the effect included in income from continuing operations in the reporting period that includes the enactment date. This guidance is applicable for the tax effects of items in AOCI that were originally recognized in Other Comprehensive Income.  As a result and absent the new guidance in this ASU, the tax effects of items within AOCI do not reflect the newly enacted corporate tax rate. While the reclassification between AOCI and Retained Earnings is optional under the new guidance, the ASU also requires certain new disclosure requirements regardless of whether the reclassification is made.   
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The new guidance must be applied either retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the income tax effects of Tax Reform related to items remaining in AOCI are recognized, or at the beginning of the period of adoption.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard, including the possibility of early adoption.

4  .    RATE MATTERS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  The Registrants are involved in rate and regulatory proceedings at the FERC and their state commissions.  Rate matters can have a material impact on net income, cash flows and possibly financial condition.  The Registrants  recent significant rate orders and pending rate filings are addressed in this note. 
    
  Impact of Tax Reform 
    
  Rate and regulatory matters are impacted by federal income tax implications.  In December 2017, Tax Reform was enacted, which will impact outstanding rate and regulatory matters.  For details on the impact of Tax Reform, see Note   12   - Income Taxes. 
    
  AEP Texas Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas) 
    
  AEP Texas Interim Transmission and Distribution Rates 
    
  As of   December 31, 2017  , AEP Texas  cumulative revenues from interim base rate increases from 2008 through 2017, subject to review, are estimated to be   $763 million  .  A base rate review could produce a refund if AEP Texas incurs a disallowance of the transmission or distribution investment on which an interim increase was based.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring.  A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission and distribution rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  In November 2017, the PUCT published a proposed rule requiring investor-owned utilities operating solely inside ERCOT to make periodic filings for rate proceedings. The proposal would require AEP Texas to file for a comprehensive rate review no later than April 1, 2019.  In January 2018, AEP Texas submitted comments on the rule proposing, among other changes, that its initial filing due date under the rule be changed from April 1, 2019 to May 1, 2019.   
    
  Hurricane Harvey 
    
  In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey hit the coast of Texas, causing power outages in the AEP Texas service territory.  AEP Texas has a PUCT approved catastrophe reserve in base rates and can defer incremental storm expenses.  AEP Texas currently recovers approximately   $1 million   of storm costs annually through base rates.  As of   December 31, 2017  , the total balance of AEP Texas  deferred storm costs is approximately   $123 million  , inclusive of approximately   $100 million   of incremental storm expenses recorded as a regulatory asset related to Hurricane Harvey.  As of December 31, 2017, AEP Texas has recorded approximately   $133 million   of capital expenditures related to Hurricane Harvey.  Also, as of December 31, 2017, AEP Texas has received   $10 million   in insurance proceeds, which were applied to the regulatory asset and property, plant and equipment.  Management, in conjunction with the insurance adjusters, is reviewing all damages to determine the extent of coverage for additional insurance reimbursement.  Any future insurance recoveries received will be applied to and will offset the regulatory asset and property, plant and equipment, as applicable.  Management believes the amount recorded as a regulatory asset is probable of recovery and AEP Texas is currently evaluating recovery options for the regulatory asset.  The other named 2017 hurricanes did not have a material impact on AEP s operations.  If the ultimate costs of the incident are not recovered by insurance or through the regulatory process, it would have an adverse effect on future net income, cash flows and financial condition. 

202 

APCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and APCo) 
    
  Virginia Legislation Affecting Biennial Reviews 
    
  In 2015, amendments to Virginia law governing the regulation of investor-owned electric utilities were enacted.  Under the amended Virginia law, APCo s existing generation and distribution base rates are frozen until after the Virginia SCC rules on APCo s next biennial review, which APCo will file in March 2020 for the 2018 and 2019 test years.  These amendments also precluded the Virginia SCC from performing biennial reviews of APCo s earnings for the years 2014 through 2017. 
    
  In February 2018, legislation separately passed the Virginia House of Delegates and the Senate of Virginia and, if enacted and signed into law by the Governor in its present form, will: (a) require APCo to not recover   $10 million   of fuel expenses incurred after July 1, 2018, (b) reduce APCo s base rates by   $50 million   annually, on an interim basis and subject to true-up, effective July 30, 2018 related to Tax Reform and (c) require an adjustment in APCo s base rates on April 1, 2019 to reflect actual annual reductions in corporate income taxes due to Tax Reform.  APCo s next base rate review in 2020 will now include a review of earnings for test years 2017-2019, with triennial reviews of APCo s base rates and earnings thereafter instead of biennial reviews.  The current VA legislative session is scheduled to adjourn in March 2018.  Either a biennial review of 2018-2019 or a triennial review of 2017-2019 could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  
    
  ETT Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP) 
    
  ETT Interim Transmission Rates 
    
  AEP has a   50%   equity ownership interest in ETT.  Predominantly all of ETT s revenues are based on interim rate changes that can be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next filed base rate proceeding.  Through   December 31, 2017  , AEP s share of ETT s cumulative revenues that are subject to review is estimated to be   $746 million  .      A base rate review could produce a refund if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim increase was based.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring.  A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  In November 2017, the PUCT published a proposed rule requiring investor-owned utilities operating solely inside ERCOT to make periodic filings for rate proceedings. The proposal requires ETT to file for a comprehensive rate review no later than February 1, 2021.  In January 2018, ETT submitted comments recommending changes to the proposed draft rule.   
    
  I M Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  2017 Indiana Base Rate Case 
    
  In July 2017, I M filed a request with the IURC for a   $263 million   annual increase in Indiana rates based upon a proposed   10.6%   return on common equity with the annual increase to be implemented after June 2018.  Upon implementation, this proposed annual increase would be subject to a temporary offsetting   $23 million   annual reduction to customer bills through December 2018 for a credit adjustment rider related to the timing of estimated in-service dates of certain capital expenditures.  The proposed annual increase includes   $78 million   related to increased annual depreciation rates and an   $11 million   increase related to the amortization of certain Cook Plant and Rockport Plant regulatory assets.  The increase in depreciation rates includes a change in the expected retirement date for Rockport Plant, Unit 1 from 2044 to 2028 combined with increased investment at the Cook Plant, including the Cook Plant Life Cycle Management Project.   
    
  In November 2017, various intervenors filed testimony that included annual revenue increase recommendations ranging from   $125 million   to   $152 million  .  The recommended returns on common equity ranged from   8.65%   to   9.1%  .  In addition, certain parties recommended longer recovery periods than I M proposed for recovery of regulatory assets and depreciation expenses related to Rockport Plant, Units 1 and 2.  In January 2018, in response to a January 2018 IURC request related to the impact of Tax Reform on I M s pending base rate case, I M filed updated schedules supporting a   $191 million   annual increase in Indiana base rates if the effect of Tax Reform was included in the cost of service.   

203 

In February 2018, I M and all parties to the case, except one industrial customer, filed a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement for a   $97 million   annual increase in Indiana rates effective July 1, 2018 subject to a temporary offsetting reduction to customer bills through December 2018 for a credit rider related to the timing of estimated in-service dates of certain capital expenditures.  The one industrial customer agreed to not oppose the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement.  The difference between I M s requested   $263 million   annual increase and the   $97 million   annual increase in the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement is primarily due to lower federal income taxes as a result of the reduction in the federal income tax rate due to Tax Reform, the feedback of credits for excess deferred income taxes, a   9.95%   return on equity, longer recovery periods of regulatory assets, lower depreciation expense primarily for meters, and an increase in the sharing of off-system sales margins with customers from   50%   to   95%  .  I M will also refund   $4 million   from July through December 2018 for the impact of Tax Reform for the period January through June 2018.   A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 2018.  If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
  2017 Michigan Base Rate Case 
    
  In May 2017, I M filed a request with the MPSC for a   $52 million   annual increase in Michigan base rates based upon a proposed   10.6%   return on common equity with the increase to be implemented no later than April 2018.  The proposed annual increase includes   $23 million   related to increased annual depreciation rates and a   $4 million   increase related to the amortization of certain Cook Plant regulatory assets.  The increase in depreciation rates is primarily due to the proposed change in the expected retirement date for Rockport Plant, Unit 1 from 2044 to 2028 combined with increased investment at the Cook Plant related to the Life Cycle Management Project.  Additionally, the total proposed increase includes incremental costs related to the Cook Plant Life Cycle Management Program and increased vegetation management expenses.   
    
  In October 2017, the MPSC staff and intervenors filed testimony.  The MPSC staff recommended an annual net revenue increase of   $49 million   including proposed retirement dates of 2028 for both Rockport Plant, Units 1 (from 2044) and 2 (from 2022), a reduced capacity charge and a return on common equity of   9.8%  .  The intervenors proposed certain adjustments to I M s request including no change to the current 2044 retirement date of Rockport Plant, Unit 1, a market based capacity charge effective February 2019 for up to 10% of I M s Michigan customers, but did not address an annual net revenue increase.  The intervenors  recommended returns on common equity ranged from   9.3%   to   9.5%  .  A hearing at the MPSC was held in November 2017.  
    
  In February 2018, an MPSC ALJ issued a Proposal for Decision and recommended an annual revenue increase of   $49 million  , including the intervenors  proposed capacity charge and staff s depreciation rates for Rockport Plant and a return on common equity of   9.8%  .  If the maximum 10% of customers choose an alternate supplier starting in February 2019, the estimated annual pretax loss due to the reduced capacity charge is approximately   $9 million  .  An order is expected in the first half of 2018.  If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Rockport Plant, Unit 2 Selective Catalytic Reduction 
    
  In October 2016, I M filed an application with the IURC for approval of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to install SCR technology at Rockport Plant, Unit 2 by December 2019.  The equipment will allow I M to reduce emissions of NO   x    from Rockport Plant, Unit 2 in order for I M to continue to operate that unit under current environmental requirements. The estimated cost of the SCR project is   $274 million  , excluding AFUDC, to be shared equally between I M and AEGCo.  As of   December 31, 2017  , total costs incurred related to this project, including AFUDC, were approximately   $23 million  .  The filing included a request for authorization for I M to defer its Indiana jurisdictional ownership share of costs including investment carrying costs at a weighted average cost of capital (WACC), depreciation over a 10-year period as provided by statute and other related expenses.  I M proposed recovery of these costs using the existing Clean Coal Technology Rider in a future filing subsequent to approval of the SCR project.  The AEGCo ownership share of the proposed SCR project will be billable under the Rockport Unit Power Agreement to I M and KPCo and will be subject to future regulatory approval for recovery.   

204 

In February 2017, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) and other parties filed testimony with the IURC.  The OUCC recommended approval of the CPCN but also stated that any decision regarding recovery of any under-depreciated plant due to retirement should be fully investigated in a base rate case, not in a tracker or other abbreviated proceeding.  The other parties recommended either denial of the CPCN or approval of the CPCN with conditions including a cap on the amount of SCR costs allowed to be recovered in the rider and limitations on other costs related to legal issues involving the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease.  A hearing at the IURC was held in March 2017.  An order from the IURC is pending.  In July 2017, I M filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio to remove the requirement to install SCR technology at Rockport Plant, Unit 2, which plaintiffs opposed.  The district court has delayed the deadline for installation of the SCR technology until June 2020.  In January 2018, I M filed a supplemental motion with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio proposing to install the SCR at Rockport Plant, Unit 2 and achieve the final SO   2    emission cap applicable to the plant under the consent decree by the end of 2020, before the expiration of the initial lease term.  Responsive filings were filed in February 2018 and a decision is anticipated in the first quarter of 2018. 
    
  KPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP) 
    
  2017 Kentucky Base Rate Case 
    
  In June 2017, KPCo filed a request with the KPSC for a   $66 million   annual increase in Kentucky base rates based upon a proposed   10.31%   return on common equity with the increase to be implemented no later than January 2018.  The proposed increase included: (a) lost load since KPCo last changed base rates in July 2015, (b) incremental costs related to OATT charges from PJM not currently recovered from retail ratepayers, (c) increased depreciation expense including updated Big Sandy Plant, Unit 1 depreciation rates using a proposed retirement date of 2031, (d) recovery of other Big Sandy Plant, Unit 1 generation costs currently recovered through a retail rider and (e) incremental purchased power costs.  Additionally, KPCo requested a   $4 million   annual increase in environmental surcharge revenues.  In August 2017, KPCo submitted a supplemental filing with the KPSC that decreased the proposed annual base rate revenue request to   $60 million  .  The modification was due to lower interest expense related to June 2017 debt refinancings.   
    
  In November 2017, KPCo filed a non-unanimous settlement agreement with the KPSC.  The settlement agreement included a proposed annual base rate increase of   $32 million   based upon a   9.75%   return on common equity.  
    
  In January 2018, the KPSC issued an order approving the non-unanimous settlement agreement with certain modifications resulting in an annual revenue increase of   $12 million  , effective January 2018, based on a   9.7%   return on equity.  The KPSC s primary revenue requirement modification to the settlement agreement was a   $14 million   annual revenue reduction for the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate due to Tax Reform.  The KPSC approved: (a) the deferral of   $50 million   of Rockport Plant Unit Power Agreement expenses for the years 2018 through 2022, with recovery of the deferral to be addressed in KPCo s next base rate case, (b) the recovery/return of   80%   of certain annual PJM OATT expenses above/below the corresponding level recovered in base rates, (c) KPCo s commitment to not file a base rate case for three years and (d) increased depreciation expense based upon updated Big Sandy Plant, Unit 1 depreciation rates using a 20-year depreciable life. 
    
  In February 2018, KPCo filed with the KPSC for rehearing of the January 2018 base case order and requested an additional   $2.3 million   of annual revenue increases related to: (a) the calculation of federal income tax expense, (b) recovery of purchased power costs associated with forced outages and (c) capital structure adjustments.  Also in February 2018, an intervenor filed for rehearing recommending that the reduced corporate federal income tax rate, as a result of Tax Reform, be reflected in lower purchased power expense related to the Rockport UPA.  It is anticipated that the KPSC will rule upon this rehearing request in the first quarter of 2018.

OPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and OPCo) 
    
  Ohio Electric Security Plan Filings 
    
  June 2015 - May 2018 ESP Including PPA Application and Proposed ESP Extension through 2024 
    
  In 2013, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve an ESP that included proposed rate adjustments and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders, including the DIR, effective June 2015 through May 2018.  The proposal also involved a PPA rider that would include OPCo s OVEC contractual entitlement (OVEC PPA) and would allow retail customers to receive a rate stabilizing charge or credit by hedging market-based prices with a cost-based PPA. 
    
  In 2015 and 2016, the PUCO issued orders in this proceeding.  As part of the issued orders, the PUCO approved (a) the DIR with modified rate caps, (b) recovery of OVEC-related net margin incurred beginning June 2016, (c) potential additional contingent customer credits of up to   $15 million   to be included in the PPA rider over the final four years of the PPA rider and (d) the limitation that OPCo will not flow through any capacity performance penalties or bonuses through the PPA rider.  Additionally, subject to cost recovery and PUCO approval, OPCo agreed to develop and implement, by 2021, a solar energy project(s) of at least   400   MWs and a wind energy project(s) of at least   500   MWs, with   100%   of all output to be received by OPCo.  AEP affiliates could own up to   50%   of these solar and wind projects.  In December 2016, in accordance with the stipulation agreement, OPCo filed a carbon reduction plan that focused on fuel diversification and carbon emission reductions.  In April 2017, the PUCO rejected all pending rehearing requests and the orders are all now final.  In June 2017, intervenors filed appeals to the Supreme Court of Ohio stating that the PUCO s approval of the OVEC PPA was unlawful and does not provide customers with rate stability.  
    
  In November 2016, OPCo refiled its amended ESP extension application and supporting testimony, consistent with the terms of the modified and approved stipulation agreement and based upon a 2016 PUCO order.  The amended filing proposed to extend the ESP through May 2024 and included (a) an extension of the OVEC PPA rider, (b) a proposed   10.41%   return on common equity on capital costs for certain riders, (c) the continuation of riders previously approved in the June 2015 - May 2018 ESP, (d) proposed increases in rate caps related to OPCo s DIR and (e) the addition of various new riders, including a Renewable Resource Rider.   
    
  In August 2017, OPCo and various intervenors filed a stipulation agreement with the PUCO.  The stipulation extends the term of the ESP through May 2024 and includes: (a) an extension of the OVEC PPA rider, (b) a proposed   10%   return on common equity on capital costs for certain riders, (c) the continuation of riders previously approved in the June 2015 - May 2018 ESP, (d) rate caps related to OPCo s DIR ranging from   $215 million   to   $290 million   for the periods 2018 through 2021 and (e) the addition of various new riders, including a Smart City Rider and a Renewable Generation Rider.  DIR rate caps will be reset in OPCo s next distribution base rate case which must be filed by June 2020.   
    
  In October 2017, intervenor testimony opposing the stipulation agreement was filed recommending: (a) a return on common equity to not exceed   9.3%   for riders earning a return on capital investments, (b) that OPCo should file a base distribution case concurrent with the conclusion of the current ESP in May 2018 and (c) denial of certain new riders proposed in OPCo s ESP extension.  The stipulation is subject to review by the PUCO.  A hearing at the PUCO was held in November 2017.  An order from the PUCO is expected in the first quarter of 2018. 
    
  If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect all components of its ESP rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  2016 SEET Filing 
    
  Ohio law provides for the return of significantly excessive earnings to ratepayers upon PUCO review.  Significantly excessive earnings are measured by whether the earned return on common equity of the electric utility is significantly in excess of the return on common equity that was earned during the same period by publicly traded companies, including utilities, that face comparable business and financial risk. 
  
   206 

In December 2016, OPCo recorded a 2016 SEET provision of   $58 million   based upon projected earnings data for companies in the comparable utilities risk group.  In determining OPCo s return on equity in relation to the comparable utilities risk group, management excluded the following items resolved in OPCo s Global Settlement that was filed at the PUCO in December 2016 and subsequently approved in February 2017:  (a) gain on the deferral of RSR costs, (b) refunds to customers related to the SEET remands and (c) refunds to customers related to fuel adjustment clause proceedings.   
    
  In May 2017, OPCo submitted its 2016 SEET filing with the PUCO in which management indicated that OPCo did not have significantly excessive earnings in 2016 based upon actual earnings data for the comparable utilities risk group.   
    
  In January 2018, PUCO staff filed testimony that OPCo did not have significantly excessive earnings.  Also in January 2018, an intervenor filed testimony recommending a   $53 million   refund to customers.   
    
  In February 2018, OPCo and PUCO staff filed a stipulation agreement in which both parties agreed that OPCo did not have significantly excessive earnings in 2016. 
    
  In February 2018, a procedural schedule was issued by the PUCO.  A hearing is scheduled for April 2018 and management expects to receive an order in the second quarter of 2018.  While management believes that OPCo s adjusted 2016 earnings were not excessive, management did not adjust OPCo s 2016 SEET provision due to risks that the PUCO could rule against OPCo s proposed SEET adjustments, including treatment of the Global Settlement issues described above, adjust the comparable risk group, or adopt a different 2016 SEET threshold.  If the PUCO orders a refund of 2016 OPCo earnings, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  PSO Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and PSO) 
    
  2017 Oklahoma Base Rate Case 
    
  In June 2017, PSO filed an application for a base rate review with the OCC that requested an increase in annual revenues of   $156 million  , less an   $11 million   refund obligation, for a net increase of   $145 million   based upon a proposed   10%   return on common equity.  The proposed base rate increase includes (a) environmental compliance investments, including recovery of previously deferred environmental compliance related costs currently recorded as regulatory assets, (b) Advanced Metering Infrastructure investments, (c) additional capital investments and costs to serve PSO s customers, and (d) an annual   $42 million   depreciation rate increase due primarily to shorter service lives and lower net salvage estimates.  As part of this filing, consistent with the OCC s final order in its previous base rate case, PSO requested recovery through 2040 of Northeastern Plant, Unit 3, including the environmental control investment, and the net book value of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4 that was retired in 2016.  As of   December 31, 2017  , the net book value of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4 was   $81 million  . 
    
  In January 2018, the OCC issued a final order approving a net increase in Oklahoma annual revenues of   $84 million  , which was then reduced by   $32 million   to   $52 million   to account for changes as a result of Tax Reform, based upon a return on common equity of   9.3%  .  The final order also included approval for recovery, with a debt return for investors, of the net book value of Northeastern Plant Unit 4 and an annual depreciation expense increase of   $19 million  , including requested recovery through 2040 of Northeastern Plant, Unit 3.  PSO anticipates implementing new rates in March 2018 billings. 
    
  SWEPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
    
  2012 Texas Base Rate Case 
    
  In 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk Plant.  In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo s recovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs.  Additionally, the PUCT deferred consideration of the requested increase in depreciation expense related to the change in the 2016 retirement date of the Welsh Plant, Unit 2. 
  
   207 

Upon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap.  As a result, SWEPCo reversed   $114 million   of previously recorded regulatory disallowances in 2013.  The resulting annual base rate increase was approximately   $52 million  .  In June 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT s 2014 order.  In July 2017, intervenors filed appeals with the Texas Third Court of Appeals. 
    
  If certain parts of the PUCT order are overturned and if SWEPCo cannot ultimately recover its Texas jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant investment, including AFUDC, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.   
    
  2016 Texas Base Rate Case 
    
  In December 2016, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a net increase in Texas annual revenues of   $69 million   based upon a   10%   return on common equity.  In January 2018, the PUCT issued a final order approving a net increase in Texas annual revenues of   $50 million   based upon a return on common equity of   9.6%  , effective May 2017.  The final order also included (a) approval to recover the Texas jurisdictional share of environmental investments placed in service, as of June 30, 2016, at various plants, including Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3, (b) approval of recovery of, but no return on, the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, (c) approval of $2 million additional vegetation management expenses and (d) the rejection of SWEPCo s proposed transmission cost recovery mechanism.   
    
  As a result of the final order, in the fourth quarter, SWEPCo (a) recorded an impairment charge of   $19 million  , which includes   $7 million   associated with the lack of return on Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and   $12 million   related to other disallowed plant investments (b) recognized   $32 million   of additional revenues, for the period of May 2017 through December 2017, that will be surcharged to customers     and (c) recognized an additional   $7 million   of expenses consisting primarily of depreciation expense and vegetation management expense, offset by the deferral of rate case expenses.  SWEPCo implemented new rates in February 2018 billings.  The   $32 million   of additional 2017 revenues will be collected by the end of 2018.  In addition, SWEPCo is required to file a refund tariff within 120 days to reflect the difference between rates collected under the final order and the rates that would be collected under Tax Reform. 
    
  Louisiana Turk Plant Prudence Review 
    
  Beginning January 2013, SWEPCo s formula rates, including the Louisiana jurisdictional share (approximately   33%  ) of the Turk Plant, have been collected subject to refund pending the outcome of a prudence review of the Turk Plant investment, which was placed into service in December 2012.  In October 2017, the LPSC staff filed testimony contending that SWEPCo failed to continue to evaluate the suspension or cancellation of the Turk Plant during its construction period.  In January 2018, SWEPCo and the LPSC staff filed a settlement, subject to LPSC approval, providing for a   $19 million   pretax write off of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of previously capitalized Turk Plant costs and a   $10 million   rate refund provision for previously collected revenues associated with the disallowed portion of the Turk Plant.  Based on the agreement, management concluded that the disallowance was probable resulting in a   $23 million   pretax write-off in the fourth quarter, consisting of a   $15 million   pretax impairment and an   $8 million   pretax provision for revenue refund.  The agreement requires   $2 million   of the provision to be refunded to customers in the first billing cycle following LPSC approval of the settlement and the remaining   $8 million   to be amortized as a cost of service reduction for customers over 5 years, effective August 1, 2018.  In February 2018, the LPSC approved the settlement agreement. 
    
  2015 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing 
    
  In April 2015, SWEPCo filed its formula rate plan for test year 2014 with the LPSC.  The filing included a   $14 million   annual increase, which was effective August 2015.  In February 2018, LPSC staff filed a report approving the increase as filed.  This increase is subject to refund pending commission approval .  If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 

208 

2017 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing 
    
  In April 2017, the LPSC approved an uncontested stipulation agreement that SWEPCo filed for its formula rate plan for test year 2015.  The filing included a net annual increase not to exceed   $31 million  , which was effective May 2017 and includes SWEPCo s Louisiana jurisdictional share of Welsh Plant and Flint Creek Plant environmental controls which were placed in service in 2016.  The net annual increase is subject to refund.  In October 2017, SWEPCo filed testimony in Louisiana supporting the prudence of its environmental control investment for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 and Flint Creek power plants.  These environmental costs are subject to prudence review.  A hearing at the LPSC is scheduled for May 2018.  If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.   
    
  Welsh Plant - Environmental Impact 
    
  Management currently estimates that the investment necessary to meet proposed environmental regulations through 2025 for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 could total approximately   $850 million  , excluding AFUDC.  As of   December 31, 2017  , SWEPCo had incurred costs of   $398 million  , including AFUDC, related to these projects.  Management continues to evaluate the impact of environmental rules and related project cost estimates.  As of   December 31, 2017  , the total net book value of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 was   $627 million  , before cost of removal, including materials and supplies inventory and CWIP.   
    
  In 2016, as approved by the APSC, SWEPCo began recovering   $79 million   related to the Arkansas jurisdictional share of these environmental costs, subject to prudence review in the next Arkansas filed base rate proceeding.  In April 2017, the LPSC approved recovery of   $131 million   in investments related to its Louisiana jurisdictional share of environmental controls installed at Welsh Plant, effective May 2017.  SWEPCo s approved Louisiana jurisdictional share of Welsh Plant deferrals: (a) are   $11 million  , excluding   $6 million   of unrecognized equity as of   December 31, 2017  , (b) is subject to review by the LPSC, and (c) includes a WACC return on environmental investments and the related depreciation expense and taxes.  In January 2018, SWEPCo received written approval from the PUCT to recover its project costs from retail customers in its 2016 Texas base rate case and is recovering these costs from wholesale customers through SWEPCo s FERC-approved agreements.  See  2016 Texas Base Rate Case  and  2017 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing  disclosures above. 
    
  If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  FERC Rate Matters    
    
  PJM Transmission Rates   (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, APCo, I M and OPCo) 
    
  In June 2016, PJM transmission owners, including AEP s eastern transmission subsidiaries and various state commissions filed a settlement agreement at the FERC to resolve outstanding issues related to cost responsibility for charges to transmission customers for certain transmission facilities that operate at or above 500 kV.  In July 2016, certain parties filed comments at the FERC contesting the settlement agreement.  Upon final FERC approval, PJM would implement a transmission enhancement charge adjustment through the PJM OATT, billable through 2025.  Management expects that any refunds received would generally be returned to retail customers through existing state rider mechanisms. 
    
  FERC Transmission Complaint - AEP s PJM Participants   (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, APCo, I M and OPCo) 
    
  In October 2016, several parties filed a complaint at the FERC that states the base return on common equity used by AEP s eastern transmission subsidiaries in calculating formula transmission rates under the PJM OATT is excessive and should be reduced from   10.99%   to   8.32%  , effective upon the date of the complaint.  Management believes its financial statements adequately address the impact of the complaint.  In November 2017, a FERC order set the matter for hearing and settlement procedures.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint, including refunds from the date of the complaint filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
  
   209 

Modifications to AEP s PJM Transmission Rates   (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, APCo, I M and OPCo) 
    
  In November 2016, AEP s eastern transmission subsidiaries filed an application at the FERC to modify the PJM OATT formula transmission rate calculation, including an adjustment to recover a tax-related regulatory asset and a shift from historical to projected expenses.  In March 2017, the FERC accepted the proposed modifications effective January 1, 2017, subject to refund, and set this matter for hearing and settlement procedures.  The modified PJM OATT formula rates are based on projected calendar year financial activity and projected plant balances.  In December 2017, AEP s eastern transmission subsidiaries filed an uncontested settlement agreement with the FERC resolving all outstanding issues.  If the FERC determines that any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  FERC Transmission Complaint - AEP s SPP Participants   (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, PSO and SWEPCo) 
    
  In June 2017, several parties filed a complaint at the FERC that states the base return on common equity used by AEP s western transmission subsidiaries in calculating formula transmission rates under the SPP OATT is excessive and should be reduced from   10.7%   to   8.36%  , effective upon the date of the complaint.  In November 2017, a FERC order set the matter for hearing and settlement procedures.  Management believes its financial statements adequately address the impact of the complaint.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint, including refunds from the date of the complaint filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  
    
  Modifications to AEP s SPP Transmission Rates   (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, PSO and SWEPCo) 
    
  In October 2017, AEP s western transmission subsidiaries filed an application at the FERC to modify the SPP OATT formula transmission rate calculation, including an adjustment to recover a tax-related regulatory asset and a shift from historical to projected expenses.  The modified SPP OATT formula rates are based on projected 2018 calendar year financial activity and projected plant balances.  In December 2017, the FERC accepted the proposed modifications effective January 1, 2018, subject to refund, and set this matter for hearing and settlement procedures.  If the FERC determines that any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  FERC SWEPCo Power Supply Agreements Complaint - East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ETEC) and Northeast Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. (NTEC) 
    
  In September 2017, ETEC and NTEC filed a complaint at the FERC that states the base return on common equity used by SWEPCo in calculating their power supply formula rates is excessive and should be reduced from   11.1%   to   8.41%  , effective upon the date of the complaint.  In November 2017, a FERC order set the matter for hearing and settlement procedures.  Management believes its financial statements adequately address the impact of the complaint.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint, including refunds from the date of the complaint filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

    This balance primarily represents regulatory liabilities for excess accumulated deferred income taxes (Excess ADIT) as a result of the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from   35%   to   21%   related to the enactment of Tax Reform.  The regulatory liability balance predominately pays a return due to the inclusion of Excess ADIT in rate base.  The mechanism and refund period to provide the Excess ADIT to customers will be based on future orders from the respective commission in each jurisdiction.  See  Federal Tax Reform  section of Note 12 for additional information.

(b) 
    As of December 31, 2017, I M also charged   $43 million   to asset removal costs related to various Tanners Creek Plant related assets, primarily related to the net book value of ARO assets.  The Indiana and Michigan retail jurisdictions of I M have increased depreciation rates on Rockport Plant to recover the net book value of Tanners Creek Plant that was retired in 2015.  I M intends to address the need for increases in depreciation rates to recover the deferral in its next Indiana and Michigan base rate cases.

6  .    COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  The Registrants are subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.  In addition, the Registrants business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment.  The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Registrants cannot be predicted.  Management accrues contingent liabilities only when management concludes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  When management determines that it is not probable, but rather reasonably possible that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, management discloses such contingencies and the possible loss or range of loss if such estimate can be made.  Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties.  Any estimated range of possible loss may not represent the maximum possible loss exposure.  Circumstances change over time and actual results may vary significantly from estimates. 
    
  For current proceedings not specifically discussed below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on the financial statements. 

COMMITMENTS (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)

AEP also issues letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under four uncommitted facilities totaling   $345 million  .  In October 2017, a   $100 million   uncommitted facility expired.  As of   December 31, 2017  , the Registrants  maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities were as follows:  

AEP has   $45 million   of variable rate Pollution Control Bonds supported by   $46 million   of bilateral letters of credit maturing in July 2019. 

227 

Guarantees of Third-Party Obligations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
    
  As part of the process to receive a renewal of a Texas Railroad Commission permit for lignite mining, SWEPCo provides guarantees of mine reclamation of   $115 million  .  Since SWEPCo uses self-bonding, the guarantee provides for SWEPCo to commit to use its resources to complete the reclamation in the event the work is not completed by Sabine.  This guarantee ends upon depletion of reserves and completion of final reclamation.  It is estimated the reserves will be depleted in 2036 with final reclamation completed by 2046 at an estimated cost of approximately   $76 million  .  Actual reclamation costs could vary due to period inflation and any changes to actual mine reclamation.  As of   December 31, 2017  , SWEPCo has collected approximately   $72 million   through a rider for final mine closure and reclamation costs, of which   $76 million   is recorded in Asset Retirement Obligations, offset by   $4 million   that is recorded in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on SWEPCo s balance sheet.   
    
  Sabine charges SWEPCo, its only customer, all of its costs.  SWEPCo passes these costs to customers through its fuel clause. 
    
  Guarantees of Equity Method Investees (Applies to AEP) 
    
  AEP issued a performance guarantee for a 50% owned joint venture which is accounted for as an equity method investment. If the joint venture were to default on payments or performance, AEP would be required to make payments on behalf of the joint venture. As of December 31, 2017, the maximum potential amount of future payments associated with this guarantee was   $75 million  , which expires in December 2019. 
    
  Indemnifications and Other Guarantees 
    
  Contracts 
    
  The Registrants enter into certain types of contracts which require indemnifications.  Typically these contracts include, but are not limited to, sale agreements, lease agreements, purchase agreements and financing agreements.  Generally, these agreements may include, but are not limited to, indemnifications around certain tax, contractual and environmental matters.  With respect to sale agreements, exposure generally does not exceed the sale price.  As of December 31,   2017  , there were no material liabilities recorded for any indemnifications. 
    
  AEPSC conducts power purchase and sale activity on behalf of APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo, who are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted on their behalf.  AEPSC also conducts power purchase and sale activity on behalf of PSO and SWEPCo, who are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted on their behalf. 
    
  Lease Obligations 
    
  Certain Registrants lease certain equipment under master lease agreements.  See  Master Lease Agreements ,  Railcar Lease  and  AEPRO Boat and Barge Leases  sections of Note   13   for disclosure of lease residual value guarantees. 

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES (Applies to All Registrants except AEPTCo) 
    
  The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation  
    
  By-products from the generation of electricity include materials such as ash, slag, sludge, low-level radioactive waste and SNF.  Coal combustion by-products, which constitute the overwhelming percentage of these materials, are typically treated and deposited in captive disposal facilities or are beneficially utilized.  In addition, the generation plants and transmission and distribution facilities have used asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and other hazardous and nonhazardous materials.  The Registrants currently incur costs to dispose of these substances safely. 

228 

Superfund addresses clean-up of hazardous substances that are released to the environment.  The Federal EPA administers the clean-up programs.  Several states enacted similar laws.  As of December 31,   2017  , APCo and OPCo are named as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) for one site and three sites, respectively, by the Federal EPA for which alleged liability is unresolved.  There are eleven additional sites for which APCo, I M, OPCo and SWEPCo received information requests which could lead to PRP designation.  I M has also been named potentially liable at two sites under state law including the I M site discussed in the next paragraph.  In those instances where a PRP or defendant has been named, disposal or recycling activities were in accordance with the then-applicable laws and regulations.  Superfund does not recognize compliance as a defense, but imposes strict liability on parties who fall within its broad statutory categories.  Liability has been resolved for a number of sites with no significant effect on net income. 
    
  In 2008, I M received a letter from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) concerning conditions at a site under state law and requesting I M take voluntary action necessary to prevent and/or mitigate public harm.  I M started remediation work in accordance with a plan approved by MDEQ.  In 2014, I M recorded an accrual for remediation at certain additional sites in Michigan.  As a result of completed remediation work in 2015 and 2017, I M s accrual was reduced.  As of December 31,   2017  , I M s accrual for all of these sites is   $100 thousand  .  The remediation work is expected to be completed in 2018. 
    
  Management evaluates the potential liability for each Superfund site separately, but several general statements can be made about potential future liability.  Allegations that materials were disposed at a particular site are often unsubstantiated and the quantity of materials deposited at a site can be small and often nonhazardous.  Although Superfund liability has been interpreted by the courts as joint and several, typically many parties are named as PRPs for each site and several of the parties are financially sound enterprises.  At present, management s estimates do not anticipate material cleanup costs for identified Superfund sites. 
    
  NUCLEAR CONTINGENCIES (APPLIES TO AEP AND I M) 
    
  I M owns and operates the two-unit 2,278 MW Cook Plant under licenses granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  I M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of SNF and to safely decommission and decontaminate the plant.  The licenses to operate the two nuclear units at the Cook Plant expire in 2034 and 2037.  The operation of a nuclear facility also involves special risks, potential liabilities and specific regulatory and safety requirements.  By agreement, I M is partially liable, together with all other electric utility companies that own nuclear generation units, for a nuclear power plant incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S.  Should a nuclear incident occur at any nuclear power plant in the U.S., the resultant liability could be substantial. 
    
  Westinghouse Electric Company Bankruptcy Filing 
    
  In March 2017, Westinghouse filed a petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  It intends to reorganize, not cease business operations.  However, it is in the early stages of the bankruptcy process and it is unclear whether the company can successfully reorganize.  Westinghouse and I M have a number of significant ongoing contracts relating to reactor services, nuclear fuel fabrication and ongoing engineering projects.  The most significant of these relate to Cook Plant fuel fabrication.  Westinghouse has stated that it intends to continue performance on I M s contracts, but given the importance of upcoming dates in the fuel fabrication process for Cook Plant, and their vital part in Cook Plant s ongoing operations, I M continues to work with Westinghouse in the bankruptcy proceedings to avoid any interruptions to that service. 
    
  In January 2018, Westinghouse issued a news release stating that it intends to sell all of its global business, including the portion of the nuclear business that contracts with Cook Plant.  Any sale would require approval by the bankruptcy court.  In the unlikely event Westinghouse rejects I M s contracts, or there is an interference with the sale process, Cook Plant s operations would be significantly impacted and potentially shut down temporarily as I M seeks other vendors for these services. 

229 

Decommissioning and Low Level Waste Accumulation Disposal 
    
  The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations and the SNF disposal program.  Decommissioning costs are accrued over the service life of the Cook Plant.  The most recent decommissioning cost study was performed in 2015.  According to that study, the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste is   $1.6 billion   in 2015 nondiscounted dollars, with additional ongoing costs of   $5 million   per year for post decommissioning storage of SNF and an eventual cost of   $57 million   for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility, also in 2015 nondiscounted dollars.  I M recovers estimated decommissioning costs for the Cook Plant in its rates.  The amounts recovered in rates were   $9 million  ,   $9 million   and   $9 million   for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Decommissioning costs recovered from customers are deposited in external trusts. 
     
  As of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , the total decommissioning trust fund balance was   $2.2 billion   and   $1.9 billion  , respectively.  Trust fund earnings increase the fund assets and decrease the amount remaining to be recovered from ratepayers.  The decommissioning costs (including interest, unrealized gains and losses and expenses of the trust funds) increase or decrease the recorded liability. 
    
  I M continues to work with regulators and customers to recover the remaining estimated costs of decommissioning the Cook Plant.  However, future net income and cash flows would be reduced and financial condition could be impacted if the cost of SNF disposal and decommissioning continues to increase and cannot be recovered. 
    
  SNF Disposal 
    
  The federal government is responsible for permanent SNF disposal and assesses fees to nuclear plant owners for SNF disposal.  A fee of one mill per KWh for fuel consumed after April 6, 1983 at the Cook Plant was collected from customers and remitted to the Department of Energy (DOE) through May 14, 2014.  In May 2014, pursuant to court order from the U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the DOE adjusted the fee to zero.  As of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , fees and related interest of   $269 million   and   $266 million  , respectively, for fuel consumed prior to April 7, 1983 have been recorded as Long-term Debt and funds collected from customers along with related earnings totaling   $312 million   and   $311 million  , respectively, to pay the fee are recorded as part of Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on the balance sheets.  I M has not paid the government the pre-April 1983 fees due to continued delays and uncertainties related to the federal disposal program. 
    
  In 2011, I M signed a settlement agreement with the federal government which permits I M to make annual filings to recover certain SNF storage costs incurred as a result of the government s delays in accepting SNF for permanent storage.  Under the settlement agreement, I M received   $22 million  ,   $6 million   and   $13 million   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, to recover costs and will be eligible to receive additional payment of annual claims for allowed costs that are incurred through December 31, 2019.  The proceeds reduced costs for dry cask storage.  As of December 31,   2017  , I M has deferred   $11 million   in Prepayments and Other Current Assets and   $5 million   in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheet of dry cask storage and related operation and maintenance costs for recovery under this agreement.  
    
  See  Fair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal  section of Note   11   for disclosure of the fair value of assets within the trusts. 

230 

Nuclear Insurance 
    
  I M carries insurance coverage in the amount of   $3 billion   for a nuclear incident at the Cook Plant for decontamination, stabilization and extraordinary incidents caused by premature decommissioning.  Insurance coverage for a nonnuclear property incident at the Cook Plant is   $1.5 billion  .  Additional insurance provides coverage for a weekly indemnity payment resulting from an insured accidental outage.  I M utilizes industry mutual insurers for the placement of this insurance coverage.  Coverage from these industry mutual insurance programs require a contingent financial obligation of up to   $51 million   for I M, which is assessable if the insurer s financial resources would be inadequate to pay for industry losses. 
    
  The Price-Anderson Act, extended through December 31, 2025, establishes insurance protection for public nuclear liability arising from a nuclear incident at   $13.4 billion   and applies to any incident at a licensed reactor in the U.S.  Commercially available insurance, which must be carried for each licensed reactor, provides   $450 million   of coverage.  In the event of a nuclear incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S., the remainder of the liability would be provided by a deferred premium assessment of   $127 million   on each licensed reactor in the U.S. payable in annual installments of   $19 million  .  As a result, I M could be assessed   $255 million   per nuclear incident payable in annual installments of   $38 million  .  The number of incidents for which payments could be required is not limited. 
    
  In the event of an incident of a catastrophic nature, I M is covered for public nuclear liability for the first   $450 million   through commercially available insurance.  The next level of liability coverage of up to   $13 billion   would be covered by claim premium assessments made under the Price-Anderson Act.  In the event nuclear losses or liabilities are underinsured or exceed accumulated funds, I M would seek recovery of those amounts from customers through rate increase.  If recovery from customers is not possible, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  OPERATIONAL CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Insurance and Potential Losses 
    
  The Registrants maintain insurance coverage normal and customary for electric utilities, subject to various deductibles.  The Registrants also maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain physical damage or third-party injuries caused by cyber security incidents.  Insurance coverage includes all risks of physical loss or damage to nonnuclear assets, subject to insurance policy conditions and exclusions.  Covered property generally includes power plants, substations, facilities and inventories.  Excluded property generally includes transmission and distribution lines, poles and towers.  The insurance programs also generally provide coverage against loss arising from certain claims made by third parties and are in excess of retentions absorbed by the Registrants.  Coverage is generally provided by a combination of the protected cell of EIS and/or various industry mutual and/or commercial insurance carriers. 
    
  See  Nuclear Contingencies  section of this footnote for a discussion of I M s nuclear exposures and related insurance. 
    
  Some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities relating to a cyber security incident or damage to the Cook Plant and costs of replacement power in the event of an incident at the Cook Plant.  Future losses or liabilities, if they occur, which are not completely insured, unless recovered from customers, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 

231 

Rockport Plant Litigation (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  In July 2013, the Wilmington Trust Company filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AEGCo and I M alleging that it will be unlawfully burdened by the terms of the modified NSR consent decree after the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease expiration in December 2022.  The terms of the consent decree allow the installation of environmental emission control equipment, repowering or retirement of the unit.  The plaintiffs further allege that the defendants  actions constitute breach of the lease and participation agreement.  The plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring that the defendants breached the lease, must satisfy obligations related to installation of emission control equipment and indemnify the plaintiffs.  The New York court granted a motion to transfer this case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  In October 2013, a motion to dismiss the case was filed on behalf of AEGCo and I M. 
    
  In January 2015, the court issued an opinion and order granting the motion in part and denying the motion in part.  The court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs  claims, including the dismissal without prejudice of plaintiffs  claims seeking compensatory damages.  Several claims remained, including the claim for breach of the participation agreement and a claim alleging breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  In June 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion for partial judgment on the claims seeking dismissal of the breach of participation agreement claim as well as any claim for indemnification of costs associated with this case.  The plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint to add another claim under the lease and also filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  In November 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion to strike the plaintiffs  motion for partial judgment and filed a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. 
    
  In March 2016, the court entered an opinion and order in favor of AEGCo and I M, dismissing certain of the plaintiffs  claims for breach of contract and dismissing claims for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and further dismissing plaintiffs  claim for indemnification of costs.  By the same order, the court permitted plaintiffs to move forward with their claim that AEGCo and I M failed to exercise prudent utility practices in the maintenance and operation of Rockport Plant, Unit 2.  In April 2016, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of all remaining claims with prejudice and the court subsequently entered a final judgment.  In May 2016, plaintiffs filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on whether AEGCo and I M are in breach of certain contract provisions that plaintiffs allege operate to protect the plaintiffs  residual interests in the unit and whether the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs  claims that AEGCo and I M breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
    
  In April 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court s decisions which had dismissed certain of plaintiffs  claims for breach of contract and remanding the case to the district court to enter summary judgment in plaintiffs  favor consistent with that ruling.  In April 2017, AEGCo and I M filed a petition for rehearing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which was granted.  In June 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an amended opinion and judgment which reverses the district court s dismissal of certain of the owners  claims under the lease agreements, vacates the denial of the owners  motion for partial summary judgment and remands the case to the district court for further proceedings.  The amended opinion and judgment also affirms the district court s dismissal of the owners  breach of good faith and fair dealing claim as duplicative of the breach of contract claims and removes the instruction to the district court in the original opinion to enter summary judgment in favor of the owners. 
    
  In July 2017, AEP filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in the original NSR litigation, seeking to modify the consent decree to eliminate the obligation to install certain future controls at Rockport Plant, Unit 2 if AEP does not acquire ownership of that Unit, and to modify the consent decree in other respects to preserve the environmental benefits of the consent decree.  In November 2017, the district court granted the owners  unopposed motion to stay the lease litigation to afford time for resolution of AEP s motion to modify the consent decree. 

232 

Management will continue to defend against the claims.  Given that the district court dismissed plaintiffs  claims seeking compensatory relief as premature, and that plaintiffs have yet to present a methodology for determining or any analysis supporting any alleged damages, management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring. 
    
  Natural Gas Markets Lawsuits (Applies to AEP) 
    
  In 2002, a lawsuit was commenced in Los Angeles County California Superior Court against numerous energy companies, including AEP, alleging violations of California law through alleged fraudulent reporting of false natural gas price and volume information with an intent to affect the market price of natural gas and electricity.  AEP was dismissed from the case.  A number of similar cases were also filed in state and federal courts in several states making essentially the same allegations under federal or state laws against the same companies.  AEP is among the companies named as defendants in some of these cases.  AEP has settled, received summary judgment or was dismissed from all of these cases in 2017.   
    
  Gavin Landfill Litigation (Applies to AEP and OPCo) 
  In August 2014, a complaint was filed in the Mason County, West Virginia Circuit Court against AEP, AEPSC, OPCo and an individual supervisor alleging wrongful death and personal injury/illness claims arising out of purported exposure to coal combustion by-product waste at the Gavin Plant landfill.  As a result of OPCo transferring its generation assets to AGR, the outcome of this complaint will be the responsibility of AGR.  The lawsuit was filed on behalf of 77 plaintiffs, consisting of 39 current and former contractors of the landfill and 38 family members of those contractors.  Twelve of the family members are pursuing personal injury/illness claims (non-working direct claims) and the remainder are pursuing loss of consortium claims.  The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, as well as medical monitoring.  In September 2014, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, contending the case should be filed in Ohio.  In August 2015, the court denied the motion.  Defendants appealed that decision to the West Virginia Supreme Court.  In February 2016, a decision was issued by the court denying the appeal and remanding the case to the West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel (WVMLP), rather than back to the Mason County, West Virginia Circuit Court.  Defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the twelve non-working direct claims under Ohio law.  The WVMLP denied the motion and defendants again appealed to the West Virginia Supreme Court.  In June 2017, the West Virginia Supreme Court reversed the WVMLP decision and dismissed the claims of the twelve non-working direct claim plaintiffs.  Management will continue to defend against the remaining claims and believes the provision recorded is adequate.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential additional losses that are reasonably possible of occurring.

7  .    DISPOSITIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE AND IMPAIRMENTS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to AEP unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  DISPOSITIONS 
    
  2017 
    
  Zimmer Plant (Generation   Marketing Segment) 
    
  In February 2017, AEP signed an agreement to sell its 25.4% ownership share of Zimmer Plant to a nonaffiliated party.  The transaction closed in the second quarter of 2017 and did not have a material impact on net income, cash flows or financial condition.  The Income before Income Tax Expense and Equity Earnings of Zimmer Plant was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. 
    
  Gavin, Waterford, Darby and Lawrenceburg Plants (Generation   Marketing Segment) 
    
  In September 2016, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell AGR s Gavin, Waterford and Darby Plants as well as AEGCo s Lawrenceburg Plant totaling 5,329 MWs of competitive generation assets to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in January 2017 for   $2.2 billion  , which was recorded in Investing Activities on the statement of cash flows.  The net proceeds from the transaction were   $1.2 billion   in cash after taxes, repayment of debt associated with these assets including a make whole payment related to the debt, payment of a coal contract associated with one of the plants and transaction fees.  The sale resulted in a pretax gain of   $226 million   that was recorded in Gain on Sale of Merchant Generation Assets on AEP s statement of income for the year ended   December 31, 2017  .  
    
  2016 
    
  Tanners Creek Plant (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  In October 2016, I M sold its retired Tanners Creek Plant site including its associated asset retirement obligations (AROs) to a nonaffiliated party.  I M paid   $92 million   and the nonaffiliated party took ownership of the Tanners Creek plant site assets and assumed responsibility for environmental liabilities and AROs, including ash pond closure, asbestos abatement and decommissioning and demolition.  I M did not record a gain or loss related to this sale and will address recovery of Tanners Creek deferred costs in future rate proceedings.  If any of the costs associated with Tanners Creek are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and impact financial condition. 
    
  Wind Farms (Applies to AEP Texas) 
    
  In December 2016, TCC and TNC merged into AEP Utilities, Inc. Prior to the merger, AEP Utilities, Inc. was a subsidiary of AEP and holding company for TCC, TNC and CSW Energy, Inc.  CSW Energy, Inc. owns the Desert Sky and Trent Wind Farms ( Wind Farms ). Upon merger, AEP Utilities, Inc. changed its name to AEP Texas.  Subsequent to the merger, AEP Texas exited the merchant generation business by transferring all of the common stock of the Wind Farms to a competitive AEP affiliate.  No gain or loss was recognized and no cash was exchanged related to the disposition of the Wind Farms. 

234 

In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Wind Farms were determined to be discontinued operations. Accordingly, results of operations of the Wind Farms have been classified as discontinued operations on AEP Texas  statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as shown in the following table:  

2015 
    
  Muskingum River Plant (Generation   Marketing Segment) 
    
  In August 2015, AGR sold its retired Muskingum River Plant site including its associated asset retirement obligations to a nonaffiliated party.  AGR paid   $48 million   and the nonaffiliated party took ownership of the Muskingum River Plant site assets and assumed responsibility for environmental liabilities and AROs, including ash pond closure, asbestos abatement and decommissioning and demolition.  As a result of the sale, a net gain of   $32 million   was recognized and recorded in Other Operation on the statements of income.  The cash paid was recorded in Operating Activities on the statements of cash flows.   
    
  AEPRO (Corporate and Other) 
    
  In October 2015, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in November 2015.  The nonaffiliated party acquired AEPRO by purchasing all of the common stock of AEP Resources, Inc., the parent company of AEPRO.  The nonaffiliated party assumed certain assets and liabilities of AEPRO, excluding the equity method investment in International Marine Terminals, LLC, pension and benefit assets and liabilities and debt obligations.  Prior to the closing of the sale, AEP retired the debt obligations of AEPRO.  AEP retained ownership of its captive barge fleet that delivers coal to the company s regulated coal-fueled power plant units owned or leased by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo.  AEP signed a contract with the nonaffiliated party to dispatch and schedule its captive barge fleet for the company s regulated coal-fueled power plant units.  AEP also had a separate contract with the nonaffiliated party to barge coal for AGR. These agreements with the nonaffiliated party extend through the end of 2019. 

235 

Results of operations of AEPRO have been classified as discontinued operations on AEP s statement of income for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as shown in the following table: 

In the second quarter of 2016, AEP recorded a $3 million loss related to the final accounting for the sale of AEPRO, which was recorded in Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax, on AEP s statements of income. 

236 

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE 
    
  2016 
    
  Gavin, Waterford, Darby and Lawrenceburg Plants (Generation   Marketing Segment) 
  In the third quarter of 2016, management determined the Gavin, Waterford, Darby and Lawrenceburg Plants met the classification of held for sale.  Accordingly, the four plants  assets and liabilities were recorded as Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Held for Sale on AEP s balance sheet as of   December 31, 2016   and as shown in the table below.  The Income before Income Tax Expense and Equity Earnings of the four plants was approximately   $375 million   and   $451 million   for the years ended December 31,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

IMPAIRMENTS 
    
  2017 
    
  Merchant Generating Assets (Generation   Marketing Segment) 
    
  Through the third quarter of 2017, AEP recorded an additional pretax impairment of   $4 million   in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on AEP s statements of income related to the Merchant Coal-fired Generation Assets.  The initial impairment recorded related to these assets is discussed in the  2016  section below. In addition, AEP recorded a   $7 million   pretax impairment as Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on AEP s statements of income related to the sale of Zimmer Plant.  The sale is further discussed in the  Disposition  section of this note. 
    
  Due to a significant increase in estimated costs identified in December 2017 to repair a defective dam structure at Racine Hydroelectric Plant ( Racine ), AEP performed an impairment analysis on Racine in accordance with accounting guidance for impairments of long-lived assets.  AEP performed step one of the impairment analysis using undiscounted cash flows for the estimated useful life of Racine based upon energy and capacity price curves, which were developed internally with both observable Level 2 third party quotations and unobservable Level 3 inputs, as well as management s forecasts of operating expenses and capital expenditures.  AEP performed step two of the impairment analysis on Racine using a ten-year discounted cash flow model based upon similar forecasted information used in the step one test.  The step two analysis resulted in a fair value determination for Racine of   $0   and AEP recorded a pretax impairment of   $43 million   in Assets Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statement of income in the fourth quarter of 2017.  

237 

Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and Turk Plant (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
  In December 2017, SWEPCo recorded a pretax impairment of   $19 million   in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statements of income related to the Texas jurisdictional share of Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and other disallowed plant investments.  Additionally in December 2017, SWEPCo recorded a pretax impairment of   $15 million   in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statements of income related to the Louisiana jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant.  See the  2016 Texas Base Rate Case  and  Louisiana Turk Plant Prudence Review  sections of Note   4  .

  Merchant Generating Assets (Generation   Marketing Segment) 
    
  In September 2016, due to AEP s ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives for its merchant generation assets, declining forecasts of future energy and capacity prices, and a decreasing likelihood of cost recovery through regulatory proceedings or legislation in the state of Ohio providing for the recovery of AEP s existing Ohio merchant generation assets, AEP performed an impairment analysis at the unit level on the remaining merchant generation assets in accordance with accounting guidance for impairments of long-lived assets.  Cardinal, Unit 1, a 43.5% interest in Conesville, Unit 4, Conesville, Units 5 and 6, a 26% interest in Stuart, Units 1-4, a 25.4% interest in Zimmer, Unit 1, and a 54.7% interest in Oklaunion (collectively the  Merchant Coal-Fired Generation Assets ) were subject to this analysis.  Additionally, Racine, Putnam and I M s Price River coal reserves ( Coal Reserves ) and the Wind Farms were also included in this analysis.  For the Merchant Coal-Fired Generation Assets, Racine and the Wind Farms, AEP performed step one of the impairment analysis using undiscounted cash flows for the estimated useful lives of the assets based upon energy and capacity price curves, as applicable, which were developed internally with both observable Level 2 third party quotations and unobservable Level 3 inputs, as well as management s forecasts of operating expenses and capital expenditures.  The step one analysis concluded the book value of Racine would be recovered and the book value of the remaining assets would not be recovered. 
    
  AEP performed step two of the impairment analysis on the Merchant Coal-Fired Generation Assets using a ten-year discounted cash flow model based upon forecasted energy and capacity price curves, which were developed internally using both observable Level 2 third party quotations and unobservable Level 3 inputs, as well as management s forecasts of operating expenses and capital expenditures.  The step two analysis resulted in projected negative cash flows.  Based on this result, coupled with the significant capital investments necessary to comply with environmental rules to allow the Merchant Coal-Fired Generation Assets to operate to the end of their currently estimated depreciable lives and the joint-ownership structure of these facilities, management determined the fair value of these assets was $0.  AEP performed step two of the impairment analysis on the Wind Farms using a ten-year discounted cash flow model utilizing forecasted energy price curves, which were developed internally using both observable Level 2 third party quotations and unobservable Level 3 inputs, as well as management s forecasts of operating expenses and capital expenditures.  The results concluded the Wind Farms were also impaired. 
    
  For the Coal Reserves, AEP performed step one of the impairment analysis and concluded the book value of the assets would not be recovered.  Step two of the impairment analysis on the Coal Reserves was performed using a market approach with Level 3 unobservable inputs.  The results concluded the Coal Reserves were also impaired. 

238 

Based on the impairment analysis performed, in the third quarter of 2016, AEP recorded a pretax impairment of $2.3 billion in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statements of income.  See the table below for additional information. 

(a) 
    Includes the   $11 million   book value of I M s Price River Coal Reserves which were fully impaired.  This $11 million impairment is reflected in the Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment. 
       
  Based on capital expenditure activity of the Merchant Coal-fired Generation Assets in the fourth quarter of 2016, AEP recorded a pretax impairment of an additional   $3 million   in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on AEP s statement of income.

8  .    BENEFIT PLANS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants except AEPTCo unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  For a discussion of investment strategy, investment limitations, target asset allocations and the classification of investments within the fair value hierarchy, see  Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities  and  Investments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities  sections of Note   1  . 
    
  AEP sponsors a qualified pension plan and two unfunded nonqualified pension plans.  Substantially all AEP employees are covered by the qualified plan or both the qualified and a nonqualified pension plan.  AEP also sponsors OPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees. 
    
  Due to the Registrant Subsidiaries  participation in AEP s benefits plans, the assumptions used by the actuary and the accounting for the plans by each subsidiary are the same.  This section details the assumptions that apply to all Registrants and the rate of compensation increase for each Registrant. 
    
  The Registrants recognize the funded status associated with defined benefit pension and OPEB plans on the balance sheets.  Disclosures about the plans are required by the  Compensation   Retirement Benefits  accounting guidance.  The Registrants recognize an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status, and recognize, as a component of other comprehensive income, the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year that are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost.  The Registrants record a regulatory asset instead of other comprehensive income for qualifying benefit costs of regulated operations that for ratemaking purposes are deferred for future recovery.  The cumulative funded status adjustment is equal to the remaining unrecognized deferrals for unamortized actuarial losses or gains, prior service costs and transition obligations, such that remaining deferred costs result in an AOCI equity reduction or regulatory asset and deferred gains result in an AOCI equity addition or regulatory liability. 
    
  Actuarial Assumptions for Benefit Obligations 
    
  The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the Registrants  benefit obligations are shown in the following tables: 

(a) 
    Rates are for base pay only.  In addition, an amount is added to reflect target incentive compensation for exempt employees and overtime and incentive pay for nonexempt employees. 
       
  A duration-based method is used to determine the discount rate for the plans.  A hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds is constructed with cash flows matching the benefit plan liability.  The composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio is used as the discount rate for the plan.  The discount rate is the same for each Registrant. 
  
   240 

For   2017  , the rate of compensation increase assumed varies with the age of the employee, ranging from   3.5%   per year to   12%   per year, with the average increase shown in the table above.  The compensation increase rates reflect variations in each Registrants  population participating in the pension plan. 
    
  Actuarial Assumptions for Net Periodic Benefit Costs 
    
  The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of each Registrants  benefit costs are shown in the following tables: 

(a) 
    Rates are for base pay only.  In addition, an amount is added to reflect target incentive compensation for exempt employees and overtime and incentive pay for nonexempt employees. 
       
  The expected return on plan assets was determined by evaluating historical returns, the current investment climate (yield on fixed income securities and other recent investment market indicators), rate of inflation, third party forecasts and current prospects for economic growth.  The expected return on plan assets is the same for each Registrant. 
    
  The health care trend rate assumptions used for OPEB plans measurement purposes are shown below: 

241 

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the OPEB health care plans.  A   1%   change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: 

Significant Concentrations of Risk within Plan Assets 
    
  In addition to establishing the target asset allocation of plan assets, the investment policy also places restrictions on securities to limit significant concentrations within plan assets.  The investment policy establishes guidelines that govern maximum market exposure, security restrictions, prohibited asset classes, prohibited types of transactions, minimum credit quality, average portfolio credit quality, portfolio duration and concentration limits.  The guidelines were established to mitigate the risk of loss due to significant concentrations in any investment.  Management monitors the plans to control security diversification and ensure compliance with the investment policy.  As of December 31,   2017  , the assets were invested in compliance with all investment limits.  See  Investments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities  section of Note   1   for limit details. 
    
  Benefit Plan Obligations, Plan Assets and Funded Status 
    
  The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the plans  benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets and funded status.  The benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation, respectively.

Amounts Recognized on the Balance Sheets 

246 

Amounts Included in AOCI, Income Tax Expense and Regulatory Assets 

247 

248 

(a) 
    Amounts relate to the re-measurement of Deferred Income Taxes as a result of Tax Reform.  In accordance with the accounting guidance for  Income Taxes , re-measurement of Deferred Income Taxes related to AOCI must flow through the statement of income. 
       
  Components of the change in amounts included in AOCI, Income Tax Expense and Regulatory Assets by Registrant are as follows: 

249 

Determination of Pension Expense 
    
  The determination of pension expense or income is based on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility.  This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur.  Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return. 
    
  Pension and OPEB Assets 
    
  The fair value tables within Pension and OPEB Assets present the classification of assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy.  All Level 1, 2, 3 and Other amounts can be allocated to the Registrant Subsidiaries using the percentages in the table below: 

250 

The following table presents the classification of pension plan assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31,   2017  : 

(a) 
    Amounts in  Other  column primarily represent an obligation to repay collateral received as part of the Securities Lending Program. 
              (b) 
    Amounts in  Other  column primarily represent accrued interest, dividend receivables and transactions pending settlement. 
              (c) 
    Amounts in  Other  column represent investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per share. 
       
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of AEP s assets classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the pension assets: 

(a) 
    The classification of Level 3 assets from the prior year was corrected in the current year presentation and included within the fair value hierarchy table as of December 31, 2017 as  Other  investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per share in accordance with ASU 2015-07, Disclosure for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). Management concluded that these disclosure errors were immaterial individually and in the aggregate to all prior periods presented.

              (b) 
    Amounts in  Other  column represent investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per share. 
       
  Accumulated Benefit Obligation 
    
  The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans is as follows: 

254 

For the underfunded pension plans that had an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets of these plans were as follows: 

Estimated Future Benefit Payments and Contributions 
    
  The estimated pension benefit payments and contributions to the trust are at least the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act plus payment of unfunded nonqualified benefits.  For the qualified pension plan, additional discretionary contributions may also be made to maintain the funded status of the plan.   For OPEB plans, expected payments include the payment of unfunded benefits.  The following table provides the estimated contributions and payments by Registrant for   2018  : 

255 

The tables below reflect the total benefits expected to be paid from the plan or from the Registrants  assets.  The payments include the participants  contributions to the plan for their share of the cost.  Future benefit payments are dependent on the number of employees retiring, whether the retiring employees elect to receive pension benefits as annuities or as lump sum distributions, future integration of the benefit plans with changes to Medicare and other legislation, future levels of interest rates and variances in actuarial results.  The estimated payments for the pension benefits and OPEB are as follows: 

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost 
    
  The following tables provide the components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) by Registrant for the plans: 

256 

257 

Estimated amounts expected to be amortized to net periodic benefit costs (credits) and the impact on each Registrants  balance sheet during   2018   are shown in the following tables: 

258 

American Electric Power System Retirement Savings Plan 
    
  AEP sponsors the American Electric Power System Retirement Savings Plan, a defined contribution retirement savings plan for substantially all employees who are not covered by a retirement savings plan of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA).  This qualified plan offers participants an opportunity to contribute a portion of their pay, includes features under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and provides for company matching contributions.  The matching contributions to the plan are   100%   of the first   1%   of eligible employee contributions and   70%   of the next   5%   of contributions. 
    
  The following table provides the cost for matching contributions to the retirement savings plans by Registrant: 

UMWA Benefits 
    
  Health and Welfare Benefits (Applies to AEP and APCo) 
    
  AEP provides health and welfare benefits for certain unionized employees, retirees and their survivors who meet eligibility requirements.  APCo also provides the same UMWA health and welfare benefits for certain unionized mining retirees and their survivors who meet eligibility requirements.  AEP and APCo administer the health and welfare benefits and pay them from their general assets. 
    
  Multiemployer Pension Benefits (Applies to AEP) 
    
  UMWA pension benefits are provided through the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan (Employer Identification Number: 52-1050282, Plan Number 002), a multiemployer plan.  The UMWA pension benefits are administered by a board of trustees appointed in equal numbers by the UMWA and the Bituminous Coal Operators  Association (BCOA), an industry bargaining association.  AEP makes contributions to the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan based on provisions in its labor agreement and the plan documents.  The UMWA pension plan is different from single-employer plans as an employer s contributions may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.  A withdrawing employer may be subject to a withdrawal liability, which is calculated based upon that employer s share of the plan s unfunded benefit obligations.  If an employer fails to make required contributions or if its payments in connection with its withdrawal liability fall short of satisfying its share of the plan s unfunded benefit obligations, the remaining employers may be allocated a greater share of the remaining unfunded plan obligations.  Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), the UMWA pension plan was in Critical and Declining Status for the plan years ending June 30, 2017 and 2016, without utilization of extended amortization provisions.  As required under the PPA, the Plan adopted a Rehabilitation Plan in February 2015 which was updated in May 2016, August 2016 and May 2017. 
    
  The amounts contributed in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were immaterial and represent less than 5% of the total contributions in the plan s latest annual report based on the plan year ended June 30,   2016  .  UMWA pension contributions included a surcharge of   5%   from December 2014 through June 2015.  UMWA pension contributions included a surcharge of   10%   from July 2015 through June 2016 at which time new base contribution rates went into effect with no associated surcharges.  
  
   259 

Under the terms of the UMWA pension plan, contributions will be required to continue beyond the February 28, 2018 expiration of the current collective bargaining agreement, whether or not the term of that agreement is extended or a subsequent agreement is entered, so long as both the UMWA pension plan remains in effect and an AEP affiliate continues to operate the facility covered by the current collective bargaining agreement.  The contribution rate applicable would be determined in accordance with the terms of the UMWA pension plan by reference to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement, subject to periodic revisions, between the UMWA and the BCOA.  If the UMWA pension plan would terminate or an AEP affiliate would cease operation of the facility without arranging for a successor operator to assume its liability, the withdrawal liability obligation would be triggered. 
    
  Based upon the planned closure of Cook Coal Terminal in 2022, AEP records a UMWA pension withdrawal liability on the balance sheet.  The UMWA pension withdrawal liability is re-measured annually and is related to the company s proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.  As of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , the liability balance was   $19 million   and   $39 million  , respectively.  AEP recovers the estimated UMWA pension withdrawal liability through fuel clauses in certain regulated jurisdictions.  A regulatory asset is recorded on the balance sheet when the UMWA pension withdrawal liability exceeds the cumulative billings collected.  As of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , the regulatory asset balance was   $1 million   and   $20 million  , respectively.  If any portion of the UMWA pension withdrawal liability is not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
  
   260 

9  .    BUSINESS SEGMENTS    
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  AEP s Reportable Segments 
    
  AEP s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.  Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight.  Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. 
    
  AEP s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below: 
    
  Vertically Integrated Utilities 

Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. 
       
  Transmission and Distribution Utilities 

Transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo.  
                
    OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve SSO customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load. 
       
  AEP Transmission Holdco 

Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEPTCo.  These investments have FERC-approved returns on equity.  
                
    Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEP s transmission-only joint ventures.  These investments have PUCT-approved or FERC-approved returns on equity. 
       
  Generation   Marketing 

Competitive generation in ERCOT and PJM. 
                
    Marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO. 
                
    Contracted renewable energy investments and management services. 
       
  The remainder of AEP s activities is presented as Corporate and Other.  While not considered a reportable segment, Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries, Parent s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income and interest expense and other nonallocated costs.  With the sale of AEPRO in November 2015, the activities related to the AEP River Operations segment have been moved to Corporate and Other for the periods presented.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 

261 

The tables below present AEP s reportable segment income statement information for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015     and reportable segment balance sheet information as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  .   

262 

263 

(a) 
    Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries.  This segment also includes Parent s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income, interest expense and discontinued operations of AEPRO and other nonallocated costs. 
              (b) 
    Includes eliminations due to an intercompany capital lease. 
              (c) 
    Includes the elimination of AEP Parent s investments in wholly-owned subsidiary companies.  
              (d) 
    Reconciling Adjustments for Total Assets primarily include the elimination of intercompany advances to affiliates and intercompany accounts receivable. 

Registrant Subsidiaries  Reportable Segments (Applies to all Registrant Subsidiaries except AEPTCo) 
    
  The Registrant Subsidiaries each have one reportable segment, an integrated electricity generation, transmission and distribution business for APCo, I M, PSO and SWEPCo, and an electricity transmission and distribution business for AEP Texas and OPCo.  Other activities are insignificant.  The Registrant Subsidiaries  operations are managed on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight on the business process, cost structures and operating results. 
  
   264 

AEPTCo s Reportable Segments 
    
  AEPTCo Parent is the holding company of seven FERC-regulated transmission-only electric utilities (State Transcos).  The seven State Transcos have been identified as operating segments of AEPTCo under the accounting guidance for  Segment Reporting.   The State Transcos business consists of developing, constructing and operating transmission facilities at the request of the RTO s in which they operate and in replacing and upgrading facilities, assets and components of the existing AEP transmission system as needed to maintain reliability standards and provide service to AEP s wholesale and retail customers.  The State Transcos are regulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by FERC and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems. 
    
  AEPTCo s Chief Operating Decision Maker makes operating decisions, allocates resources to and assesses performance based on these operating segments.  The seven State Transcos operating segments all have similar economic characteristics and meet all of the criteria under the accounting guidance for  Segment Reporting  to be aggregated into one operating segment.  As a result, AEPTCo has one reportable segment.  The remainder of AEPTCo s activity is presented in AEPTCo Parent.  While not considered a reportable segment, AEPTCo Parent represents the activity of the holding company which primarily relates to debt financing activity and general corporate activities. 
    
  The tables below present AEPTCo s reportable segment income statement information for the years ended  December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   and reportable segment balance sheet information as of   December 31, 2017   and   2016  .  

265 

(a) 
    Elimination of intercompany interest income/interest expense on affiliated debt arrangement. 
              (b) 
    Includes the elimination of AEPTCo Parent s equity earnings in State Transcos.  
              (c) 
    Elimination of intercompany debt. 
              (d) 
    Includes the elimination of AEPTCo Parent s investments in State Transcos.  
              (e) 
    Primarily relates to the elimination of Notes Receivable from the State Transcos. 

266 

10  .    DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.  For the periods presented, AEPTCo did not have any Derivative and Hedging activity. 
    
  OBJECTIVES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
    
  AEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of AEP subsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries.  AEPEP is agent for and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries. 
    
  The Registrants are exposed to certain market risks as major power producers and participants in the electricity, capacity, natural gas, coal and emission allowance markets.  These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency exchange risk.  These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact the Registrants due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates.  Management utilizes derivative instruments to manage these risks. 
    
  STRATEGIES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES 
    
  Risk Management Strategies 
    
  The strategy surrounding the use of derivative instruments primarily focuses on managing risk exposures, future cash flows and creating value utilizing both economic and formal hedging strategies.  The risk management strategies also include the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes which focus on seizing market opportunities to create value driven by expected changes in the market prices of the commodities.  To accomplish these objectives, the Registrants primarily employ risk management contracts including physical and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and options.  Not all risk management contracts meet the definition of a derivative under the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging.   Derivative risk management contracts elected normal under the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception are not subject to the requirements of this accounting guidance. 
    
  The Registrants utilize power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business.  The Registrants utilize interest rate derivative contracts in order to manage the interest rate exposure associated with the commodity portfolio.  For disclosure purposes, such risks are grouped as  Commodity,  as these risks are related to energy risk management activities.  The Registrants also utilize derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk associated with debt financing.  For disclosure purposes, these risks are grouped as  Interest Rate.   The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. 

267 

The following tables represent the gross notional volume of the Registrants  outstanding derivative contracts: 
    
  Notional Volume of Derivative Instruments 
  December 31,   2017    

Notional Volume of Derivative Instruments 
  December 31,   2016    

Fair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Parent enters into interest rate derivative transactions as part of an overall strategy to manage the mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt.  Certain interest rate derivative transactions effectively modify exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of fixed-rate debt to a floating rate.  Provided specific criteria are met, these interest rate derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedging Strategies 
    
  The Registrants utilize cash flow hedges on certain derivative transactions for the purchase and sale of power ( Commodity ) in order to manage the variable price risk related to forecasted purchases and sales.  Management monitors the potential impacts of commodity price changes and, where appropriate, enters into derivative transactions to protect profit margins for a portion of future electricity sales and purchases.  The Registrants do not hedge all commodity price risk. 
    
  The Registrants utilize a variety of interest rate derivative transactions in order to manage interest rate risk exposure.  The Registrants also utilize interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate exposure related to future borrowings of fixed-rate debt.  The Registrants do not hedge all interest rate exposure. 
    
  At times, the Registrants are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks primarily when some fixed assets are purchased from foreign suppliers.  In accordance with AEP s risk management policy, the Registrants may utilize foreign currency derivative transactions to protect against the risk of increased cash outflows resulting from a foreign currency s appreciation against the dollar.  The Registrants do not hedge all foreign currency exposure. 
  
   268 

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
    
  The accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging  requires recognition of all qualifying derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets at fair value.  The fair values of derivative instruments accounted for using MTM accounting or hedge accounting are based on exchange prices and broker quotes.  If a quoted market price is not available, the estimate of fair value is based on the best information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes, supply and demand market data and assumptions.  In order to determine the relevant fair values of the derivative instruments, the Registrants apply valuation adjustments for discounting, liquidity and credit quality. 
    
  Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform on the contract or fail to pay amounts due.  Liquidity risk represents the risk that imperfections in the market will cause the price to vary from estimated fair value based upon prevailing market supply and demand conditions.  Since energy markets are imperfect and volatile, there are inherent risks related to the underlying assumptions in models used to fair value risk management contracts.  Unforeseen events may cause reasonable price curves to differ from actual price curves throughout a contract s term and at the time a contract settles.  Consequently, there could be significant adverse or favorable effects on future net income and cash flows if market prices are not consistent with management s estimates of current market consensus for forward prices in the current period.  This is particularly true for longer term contracts.  Cash flows may vary based on market conditions, margin requirements and the timing of settlement of risk management contracts. 
    
  According to the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging,  the Registrants reflect the fair values of derivative instruments subject to netting agreements with the same counterparty net of related cash collateral.  For certain risk management contracts, the Registrants are required to post or receive cash collateral based on third party contractual agreements and risk profiles.  AEP netted cash collateral received from third parties against short-term and long-term risk management assets in the amounts of   $9.4 million   and   $7.9 million   for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.  AEP netted cash collateral paid to third parties against short-term and long-term risk management liabilities in the amounts of   $9 million   and  $7.6 million   for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.  The netted cash collateral from third parties against short-term and long-term risk management assets and netted cash collateral paid to third parties against short-term and long-term risk management liabilities were immaterial for the other Registrants for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

(a) 
    Derivative instruments within these categories are reported gross.  These instruments are subject to master netting agreements and are presented on the balance sheets on a net basis in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging.  
              (b) 
    Amounts include counterparty netting of risk management and hedging contracts and associated cash collateral in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging.  
              (c) 
    There are no derivative contracts subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement which are not offset in the statement of financial position.

The tables below present the Registrants  activity of derivative risk management contracts: 
    
  Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized on 
  Risk Management Contracts 
   Year Ended December 31,   2017    

Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized on 
  Risk Management Contracts 
   Year Ended December 31,   2016    

Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized on 
  Risk Management Contracts 
   Year Ended December 31,   2015    

(a) 
    Represents realized and unrealized gains and losses subject to regulatory accounting treatment recorded as either current or noncurrent on the balance sheets. 
     
   274 

Certain qualifying derivative instruments have been designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts, as provided in the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging.   Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales under that accounting guidance are not subject to MTM accounting treatment and are recognized on the statements of income on an accrual basis. 
    
  The accounting for the changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship.  Depending on the exposure, management designates a hedging instrument as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. 
    
  For contracts that have not been designated as part of a hedging relationship, the accounting for changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative instrument is held for trading purposes.  Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments held for trading purposes are included in revenues on a net basis on the statements of income.  Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments not held for trading purposes are included in revenues or expenses on the statements of income depending on the relevant facts and circumstances.  Certain derivatives that economically hedge future commodity risk are recorded in the same expense line item on the statements of income as that of the associated risk.  However, unrealized and some realized gains and losses in regulated jurisdictions for both trading and non-trading derivative instruments are recorded as regulatory assets (for losses) or regulatory liabilities (for gains) in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Regulated Operations.  
    
  Accounting for Fair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP) 
    
  For fair value hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or an identified portion thereof attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item associated with the hedged risk impacts Net Income during the period of change. 
    
  AEP records realized and unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting treatment and any offsetting changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged in Interest Expense on the statements of income.  For 2017, 2016, and 2015, hedging gains and losses were immaterial. 
    
  For   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial. 
    
  Accounting for Cash Flow Hedging Strategies 
    
  For cash flow hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the Registrants initially report the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets until the period the hedged item affects Net Income.  The Registrants recognize any hedge ineffectiveness in Net Income immediately during the period of change, except in regulated jurisdictions where hedge ineffectiveness would be recorded as a regulatory asset (for losses) or a regulatory liability (for gains) if applicable. 
    
  Realized gains and losses on derivative contracts for the purchase and sale of power designated as cash flow hedges are included in Total Revenues or Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income or in Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the balance sheets, depending on the specific nature of the risk being hedged.  During   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , AEP applied cash flow hedging to outstanding power derivatives.  During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Registrant Subsidiaries did not apply cash flow hedging to outstanding power derivatives. 
    
  The Registrants reclassify gains and losses on interest rate derivative hedges related to debt financings from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets into Interest Expense on the statements of income in those periods in which hedged interest payments occur.  During   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , AEP applied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives.  During   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , the Registrant Subsidiaries did not apply cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives. 

275 

The accumulated gains or losses related foreign currency hedges are reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets into Depreciation and Amortization expense on the statements of income over the depreciable lives of the fixed assets designated as the hedged items into qualifying foreign currency hedging relationships.  During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Registrants did not apply cash flow hedging to any outstanding foreign currency derivatives.  
    
  During   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial or nonexistent for all of the hedge strategies disclosed above. 
    
  For details on effective cash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets and the reasons for changes in cash flow hedges, see Note   3  . 
    
  Cash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets were: 
    
  Impact of Cash Flow Hedges on AEP s Balance Sheets 

(a) 
    Hedging Assets and Hedging Liabilities are included in Risk Management Assets and Liabilities on the balance sheets. 
       
  As of   December 31, 2017   the maximum length of time that AEP is hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows related to forecasted transactions is   120   months. 
    
  Impact of Cash Flow Hedges on the Registrant Subsidiaries  Balance Sheets 

The actual amounts reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to Net Income can differ from the estimate above due to market price changes. 
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  Management mitigates credit risk in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis.  Management uses Moody s Investors Service Inc., S P Global Inc. and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial statements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis. 

276 

Master agreements are typically used to facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty and may include collateral requirements.  Collateral requirements in the form of cash, letters of credit and parental/affiliate guarantees may be obtained as security from counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk.  Some master agreements include margining, which requires a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit in the event exposure exceeds the established threshold.  A counterparty is required to post cash or letters of credit in the event exposure exceeds the established threshold.  The threshold represents an unsecured credit limit which may be supported by a parental/affiliate guaranty, as determined in accordance with AEP s credit policy.  In addition, master agreements allow for termination and liquidation of all positions in the event of a default including a failure or inability to post collateral when required. 
    
  Collateral Triggering Events 
    
  Credit Downgrade Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo, I M, PSO and SWEPCo) 
    
  A limited number of derivative contracts include collateral triggering events, which include a requirement to maintain certain credit ratings.  On an ongoing basis, AEP s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these collateral triggering events in contracts.  AEP, APCo, I M, PSO and SWEPCo have not experienced a downgrade below a specified credit rating threshold that would require the posting of additional collateral.  The Registrants had immaterial derivative contracts with collateral triggering events in a net liability position as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. 
    
  Cross-Default Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo and I M) 
    
  In addition, a majority of non-exchange traded commodity contracts contain cross-default provisions that, if triggered, would permit the counterparty to declare a default and require settlement of the outstanding payable.  These cross-default provisions could be triggered if there was a non-performance event by Parent or the obligor under outstanding debt or a third party obligation that is   $50 million   or greater.  On an ongoing basis, AEP s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these cross-default provisions in the contracts.  The following table represents: (a) the fair value of these derivative liabilities subject to cross-default provisions prior to consideration of contractual netting arrangements, (b) the amount that the exposure has been reduced by cash collateral posted and (c) if a cross-default provision would have been triggered, the settlement amount that would be required after considering contractual netting arrangements: 

Amounts for APCo and I M are immaterial for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants except AEPTCo unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements of Long-term Debt (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  The fair values of Long-term Debt are based on quoted market prices, without credit enhancements, for the same or similar issues and the current interest rates offered for instruments with similar maturities classified as Level 2 measurement inputs.  These instruments are not marked-to-market.  The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. 
    
  The book values and fair values of Long-term Debt are summarized in the following table: 

(a) 
    Amounts include debt related to the Lawrenceburg Plant that has been classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet and has a fair value of   $172 million  .  See the Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale section of Note   7   for additional information. 
       
  Fair Value Measurements of Other Temporary Investments (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Other Temporary Investments include securities available for sale, including marketable securities that management intends to hold for less than one year and investments by AEP s protected cell of EIS.  See  Other Temporary Investments  section of Note   1  . 
    
  The following is a summary of Other Temporary Investments: 

278 

(a) 
    Primarily represents amounts held for the repayment of debt. 
              (b) 
    Primarily short and intermediate maturities which may be sold and do not contain maturity dates. 
       
  The following table provides the activity for fixed income and equity securities within Other Temporary Investments: 

For details of the reasons for changes in Securities Available for Sale included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , see Note   3  . 
    
  Fair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  Securities held in trust funds for decommissioning nuclear facilities and for the disposal of SNF are recorded at fair value.  See  Nuclear Trust Funds  section of Note   1  . 
    
  The following is a summary of nuclear trust fund investments: 

279 

The following table provides the securities activity within the decommissioning and SNF trusts: 

The base cost of fixed income securities was   $1 billion   and   $938 million   as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  The base cost of equity securities was   $594 million   and   $592 million   as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. 
    
  The fair value of fixed income securities held in the nuclear trust funds, summarized by contractual maturities, as of December 31,   2017   was as follows:

Fair Value Measurements of Financial Assets and Liabilities 
    
  For a discussion of fair value accounting and the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy, see the  Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities  section of Note   1  . 
    
  The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Registrants  financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.  As required by the accounting guidance for  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Management s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.  There have not been any significant changes in management s valuation techniques.

  Federal Tax Reform 
    
  In December 2017, legislation referred to as Tax Reform was signed into law.  The majority of the provisions in the new legislation are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.  Tax Reform includes significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, the Code), including amendments which significantly change the taxation of business entities and also includes provisions specific to regulated public utilities.  The more significant changes that affect the Registrants include the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and several technical provisions including, among others, limiting the utilization of net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward period.  The Tax Reform provisions related to regulated public utilities generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, eliminate bonus depreciation for certain property acquired after September 27, 2017 and continue certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. 
    
  Provisional Amounts 
    
  Given the significance of the legislative changes resulting from Tax Reform, the timing of its enactment, and the widespread applicability to registrants, the SEC staff recognized the potential challenges faced by registrants when reflecting the effects of Tax Reform in their 2017 financial statements.  Accordingly, in order to address potential uncertainty or diversity of views in practice regarding the application of the accounting guidance for  Income Taxes  in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for  Income Taxes  for certain tax effects of Tax Reform for the reporting period in which the legislation was enacted, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118) in December 2017.  For such areas of analysis that are incomplete, SAB 118 provides for up to a one year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting required by the accounting guidance for  Income Taxes,  referred to as the measurement period.  
    
  SAB 118 describes three categories associated with a registrant s status of accounting for Tax Reform during the measurement period: (a) a registrant is complete with its accounting for certain effects of Tax Reform, (b) a registrant s accounting is incomplete but  is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of Tax Reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount, or (c) the accounting is incomplete and a registrant is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply existing accounting guidance for income taxes, based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the Tax Reform legislation. For items in which the accounting assessment is complete or a reasonable estimate can be made, a registrant must reflect the income tax effects of Tax Reform for those items in its financial statements that include the enactment of the Tax Reform legislation. SAB 118 also requires certain disclosures to provide information about the material financial reporting impacts, if any, due to Tax Reform for which the accounting is not complete. Subsequent disclosures in future reporting periods in which the accounting is completed are also a requirement of the guidance.    
    
  The Registrants have made a reasonable estimate for the measurement and accounting of the effects of Tax Reform which have been reflected in the December 31, 2017 financial statements as provisional amounts based on information available.  While the Registrants were able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of Tax Reform, the final impact may differ from the recorded provisional amounts to the extent refinements are made to the estimated cumulative temporary differences or as a result of additional guidance or technical corrections that may be issued by the IRS that may impact management s interpretation and assumptions utilized. The Registrants expect to complete the analysis of the provisional items during the second half of 2018. 

295 

The recorded provisional amounts include   $154 million   of excess accumulated deferred income taxes (Excess ADIT) related to AEP Transmission Holdco s equity investment in ETT.  ETT is a three-member limited liability company that is a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The rates ETT is permitted to charge its customers are regulated by the PUCT.  Those rates contemplate deferred taxes; however, the income tax effects of ETT s activities are the responsibility of its members, including AEP Transmission Holdco.  As a result, AEP s proportionate share of the Excess ADIT related to ETT is reflected by AEP Transmission Holdco and is reflected in AEP s December 31, 2017 balance sheet as a reduction in Deferred Income Taxes with a corresponding increase in Regulatory Liabilities and Deferred Investment Tax Credits. AEP s accounting for Excess ADIT related to partnerships is provisional as it may be subject to further interpretation of Tax Reform. 
    
  Impact of Tax Reform on the Financial Statements 
    
  Changes in the Code due to Tax Reform had a material impact on the Registrants  2017 financial statements.  In accordance with the accounting guidance for  Income Taxes , the effect of a change in tax law must be recognized at the date of enactment.  The accounting guidance for  Income Taxes  also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences will be realized or settled.  As a result, the Registrants  deferred tax assets and liabilities were re-measured using the newly enacted tax rate of 21% in December 2017.  This re-measurement resulted in a significant reduction in the Registrants  net accumulated deferred income tax liability.  With respect to the Registrants  regulated operations, the reduction of the net accumulated deferred income tax liability was primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in income tax related regulatory assets and an increase in income tax related regulatory liabilities because the benefit of the lower federal tax rate is expected to be provided to customers.  However, when the underlying asset or liability giving rise to the temporary difference was not previously contemplated in regulated rates, the re-measurement of the deferred taxes on those assets or liabilities was recorded as an adjustment to income tax expense.  For the Registrants  unregulated operations, the re-measurement of deferred taxes arising from those operations was recorded as an adjustment to income tax expense. 
    
  The following tables provide a summary of the impact of Tax Reform on the Registrants  2017 financial statements. 

This decrease in deferred income tax liabilities resulted in an increase in income tax related regulatory liabilities, a decrease in income tax related regulatory assets and an adjustment to income tax expense as shown in the table below. 

(a) 
    In 2017, in contemplation of corporate federal tax reform, the Registrants adopted a method under Internal Revenue Section 162 for deducting repair and maintenance costs associated with transmission and distribution property.  This change resulted in a decrease in state income tax expense of approximately $10 million that has been excluded from the tables above. 
              (b) 
    AEP Texas and OPCo recorded  favorable adjustments to income tax expense of approximately   $113 million   and   $16 million   related to previously owned deregulated generation assets and certain deferred fuel amounts, respectively. 
              (c) 
    The effect of Tax Reform on AEP s other business operations (other than the Registrant Subsidiaries), which primarily include unregulated activities in the Generation   Marketing segment, transmission operations reflected in the AEP Transmission Holdco segment and activities recorded in Corporate and Other, increased income tax expense for the year-ended December 31, 2017 by approximately   $103 million  . 

296 

Regulatory Treatment 
    
  As a result of Tax Reform, the Registrants recognized a regulatory liability for approximately   $4.4 billion   of Excess ADIT, as well as an incremental liability of   $1.2 billion   to reflect the   $4.4 billion   Excess ADIT on a pre-tax basis, which is presented in Regulatory Liabilities and Deferred Income Taxes on the balance sheets.  The Excess ADIT is reflected on a pretax basis to appropriately contemplate future tax consequences in the periods when the regulatory liability is settled.  Approximately   $3.2 billion   of the Excess ADIT relates to temporary differences associated with depreciable property.  The Tax Reform legislation includes certain rate normalization requirements that stipulate how the portion of the total Excess ADIT that is related to certain depreciable property must be returned to customers.  Specifically, for AEP s regulated public utilities that are subject to those rate normalization requirements, Excess ADIT resulting from the reduction of the corporate tax rate with respect to prior depreciation or recovery deductions on property will be normalized using the average rate assumption method.  As a result, once the amortization of this Excess ADIT is reflected in rates, customers will receive the benefits over the remaining weighted average useful life of the applicable property.  
    
  For the remaining   $1.2 billion   of Excess ADIT, the Registrants expect to continue working with each state regulatory commission to determine the appropriate mechanism and time period over which to provide the benefits of Tax Reform to customers.  
    
  The Registrants expect the mechanism and time period to provide the benefits of Tax Reform to customers will vary by jurisdiction and will reduce future cash flows, may impact financial condition, but is not expected to have a material impact on future net income.  
    
  State Regulatory Matters 
    
  Various state utility commissions have recently issued orders requiring public utilities, including the Registrants, to record regulatory liabilities to reflect the corporate federal income taxes currently collected in utility rates in excess of the enacted corporate federal income tax rate of 21% beginning January 1, 2018.  See Note   4   - Rate Matters for additional information regarding state utility commission orders received impacting the Registrant Subsidiaries.

  The following tables show elements of the net deferred tax liability and significant temporary differences for each Registrant:

305 

AEP System Tax Allocation Agreement 
    
  AEP and subsidiaries join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return.  The allocation of the AEP System s current consolidated federal income tax to the AEP System companies allocates the benefit of current tax losses to the AEP System companies giving rise to such losses in determining their current tax expense.  The consolidated net operating loss of the AEP System is allocated to each company in the consolidated group with taxable losses.  The tax benefit of the Parent is allocated to its subsidiaries with taxable income.  With the exception of the allocation of the consolidated AEP System net operating loss and the loss of the Parent, the method of allocation reflects a separate return result for each company in the consolidated group. 
    
  Valuation Allowance 
    
  AEP assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate tax character will be generated to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets.  When the evaluation of the evidence indicates that AEP will not be able to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce existing deferred tax assets to the net realizable amount.  Objective negative evidence evaluated includes whether AEP has a history of recognizing income of the character which can be offset by loss carryforwards.  Other objective negative evidence evaluated is the impact recently enacted federal tax legislation will have on future taxable income and on AEP s ability to benefit from the carryforward of charitable contribution deductions. 
    
  On the basis of this evaluation, AEP recorded a valuation allowance of   $17 million   in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the expected expiration of charitable contribution carryforward deductions and realized capital losses.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, AEP also reversed a valuation allowance originally recorded in the third quarter of 2015 of   $156 million   attributable to the unrealized capital loss associated with the excess tax basis of the stock over the book value of AEP s investment in the operations of AEPRO.  With the sale of AEPRO in the fourth quarter of 2015, AEP recorded a valuation allowance of   $48 million   attributable to realized capital losses from the sale.  As of December 31, 2015 there was a valuation allowance of   $130 million   recorded against AEP s deferred tax asset balance. 
    
  AEP recorded changes in the valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016 related to the reversal of a   $56 million   unrealized capital loss where AEP effectively settled a 2011 audit issue with the IRS.  AEP also recorded changes in the third quarter of 2016 by reducing the capital loss valuation allowance by   $66 million   to reflect the impact of the reclassification of certain assets held for sale and the filing of the 2015 federal income tax return.  The sale of these assets held for sale are expected to result in a gain, the character of which will allow AEP to recognize the capital loss and allowed AEP to reverse substantially all of the remaining capital loss valuation allowance previously recorded.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, AEP reversed   $6 million   of the valuation allowance associated with charitable contributions that expired at the end of the year.  As of December 31, 2016 there was a valuation allowance of   $2 million   recorded against AEP s deferred tax asset balance related to an unrealized capital loss carryforward. 
    
  During 2017, the valuation allowance of   $2 million   recorded against AEP s deferred tax asset balance related to an unrealized capital loss carryforward was reversed, as the Company expects to have sufficient capital gains in the future to use this capital loss when realized.  As of December 31, 2017, AEP and AEPTCo have recorded valuation allowances of   $5 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, against certain state and municipal net income tax operating loss carryforwards since future taxable income is not expected to be sufficient to realize the remaining state net income tax operating loss tax benefits before the carryforward expires. 
    
  Federal and State Income Tax Audit Status 
    
  AEP and subsidiaries are no longer subject to U.S. federal examination for years before 2011.  The IRS examination of years 2011 through 2013 started in April 2014.  AEP and subsidiaries received a Revenue Agents Report in April 2016, completing the 2011 through 2013 audit cycle indicating an agreed upon audit.  The 2011 through 2013 audit was submitted to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for approval.  The Joint Committee referred the audit back to the IRS exam team for further consideration.  To resolve the issue under consideration, AEP and subsidiaries  
  
   306 

and the IRS exam team agreed to go to Appeals using Fast Track in December 2017.  The issue is still waiting for resolution with Appeals.   Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in management s opinion, adequate provisions for federal income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters.  In addition, the Registrants accrue interest on these uncertain tax positions.  Management is not aware of any issues for open tax years that upon final resolution are expected to materially impact net income. 
    
  AEP and subsidiaries file income tax returns in various state and local jurisdictions.  These taxing authorities routinely examine their tax returns.  AEP and subsidiaries are currently under examination in several state and local jurisdictions.  However, it is possible that previously filed tax returns have positions that may be challenged by these tax authorities.  Management believes that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such challenges and that the ultimate resolution of these audits will not materially impact net income.  The Registrants are no longer subject to state or local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2009. 
    
  Net Income Tax Operating Loss Carryforward 
    
  In 2017, Registrants specified in the table below recognized federal net income tax operating losses.  The 2017 federal net income tax operating losses were driven primarily by bonus depreciation and deductions related to repair and maintenance costs associated with transmission and distribution property. 

Substantially all of the 2017 federal net income tax operating losses will be carried back to 2015.  As of December 31, 2017, AEP had   $4 million   of remaining unrealized federal net operating loss carryforward tax benefits.  Management anticipates future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the remaining net income tax operating loss tax benefits before the federal carryforward expires after   2036  .  AEP, AEPTCo, I M, PSO and SWEPCo also have state net income tax operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2017 as indicated in the table below: 

307 

As of December 31, 2017, AEP and AEPTCo have recorded valuation allowances of   $5 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, against certain state and municipal net income tax operating loss carryforwards since future taxable income is not expected to be sufficient to realize the remaining state net income tax operating loss tax benefits before the carryforward expires.   Management anticipates future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the remaining state net income tax operating loss tax benefits before the carryforward expires for each state. 
    
  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, AEP had   $0 million   and   $17 million  , respectively, of uncertain tax positions netted against deferred tax liabilities. 
    
  Tax Credit Carryforward 
    
  Federal and state net income tax operating losses sustained in 2017, 2012, 2011 and 2009 along with lower federal and state taxable income in 2010 resulted in unused federal and state income tax credits.  As of December 31, 2017, the Registrants have federal tax credit carryforwards and AEP and PSO have state tax credit carryforwards as indicated in the table below.  If these credits are not utilized, federal general business tax credits will expire in the years   2032   through   2036  . 

The Registrants anticipate future federal taxable income will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of the federal tax credits before they expire unused. 
    
  Uncertain Tax Positions 
    
  In May 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the U.K. Windfall Tax imposed upon U.K. electric companies privatized between 1984 and 1996 is a creditable tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  AEP filed protective claims asserting the creditability of the tax, dependent upon the outcome of the case.  As a result of the favorable U.S. Supreme Court decision, AEP recognized a tax benefit of   $80 million  , plus   $43 million   of pretax interest income in the second quarter of 2013.  In the first quarter of 2017, AEP received the tax refund related to the U.K. Windfall Tax, including interest through the date of the refund.  
    
  The Registrants recognize interest accruals related to uncertain tax positions in interest income or expense as applicable and penalties in Other Operation expense in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Income Taxes.

Management believes that there will be no significant net increase or decrease in unrecognized benefits within   12   months of the reporting date.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate for each Registrant was as follows: 

Federal Tax Legislation  
    
  The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH) included an extension of the   50%   bonus depreciation for three years through 2017, phasing down to   40%   in 2018 and   30%   in 2019.  PATH also provided for the extension of research and development, employment and several energy tax credits for 2015.  PATH also includes provisions to extend the wind energy production tax credit through 2016 with a three-year phase-out (2017-2019), and to extend the   30%   temporary solar investment tax credit for three years through 2019 and with a two-year phase-out (2020-2021).  PATH also provided for a permanent extension of the Research and Development tax credit.  The enacted provisions did not materially impact the Registrants  net income or financial condition but did have a favorable impact on cash flows.  The federal Tax Reform eliminated bonus depreciation for certain property acquired after September 27, 2017.  
    
  State Tax Legislation 
    
  Legislation was passed by the state of Indiana in May 2011 enacting a phased reduction in the corporate income tax rate from   8.5%   to   6.5%  .  The   8.5%   Indiana corporate income tax rate was reduced   0.5%   each year beginning after June 30, 2012, with the final reduction occurring in years beginning after June 30, 2015.  Additional legislation was passed by the state of Indiana reducing the corporate income tax rate from   6.5%   in 2016 to   4.9%   beginning after June 30, 2016 with the final reduction occurring in years beginning after June 30, 2021.  The legislation did not materially impact the Registrants  net income, cash flows or financial condition. 
    
  House Bill 32 was passed by the state of Texas in June 2015, permanently reducing the Texas income/franchise tax rate from   0.95%   to   0.75%   effective January 1, 2016, applicable to reports originally due on or after the effective date.  The Texas income/franchise tax rate had been scheduled to return to   1%   in 2016.  The enacted provision did not materially impact the Registrants  net income, cash flows, or financial condition. 
    
  In March 2016, the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts issued clarifying guidance regarding the treatment of transmission and distribution expenses included in the computation of taxable income for purposes of calculating the Texas income/franchise tax.  The guidance clarified which specific transmission and distribution expenses are included in the computation of the cost of goods sold deduction.  This guidance resulted in a net favorable adjustment to net income of   $21 million  ,   $7 million  ,   $2 million   and   $9 million   in 2016 for AEP, AEP Texas, PSO and SWEPCo, respectively.   
    
  In March 2016, Louisiana enacted several tax bills impacting income taxes, franchise taxes and sales taxes.  The income tax provisions limit the use of Louisiana net operating losses and the sales tax provisions increase the sales tax rate and suspend or eliminate certain exemptions.  The legislation did not materially impact the Registrants  net income, cash flows or financial condition. 
    
  Legislation was enacted in the state of Illinois in July 2017 increasing the corporate income tax rate from   5.25%   to   7%   effective July 1, 2017, with the increased rate applied to the portion of the tax year falling on or after that date.  With the inclusion of the   2.5%   Illinois Replacement tax, the total Illinois corporate income tax rate will increase from a total of   7.75%   to a total of   9.5%  , effective July 1, 2017.  The legislation is not expected to materially impact the Registrants  net income, cash flows or financial condition.

13  .    LEASES 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  Leases of property, plant and equipment are for remaining periods up to   14 years   and require payments of related property taxes, maintenance and operating costs.  The majority of the leases have purchase or renewal options and will be renewed or replaced by other leases. 
    
  Lease rentals for both operating and capital leases are generally charged to Other Operation and Maintenance expense in accordance with rate-making treatment for regulated operations.  Additionally, for regulated operations with capital leases, a capital lease asset and offsetting liability are recorded at the present value of the remaining lease payments for each reporting period.  Capital leases for nonregulated property are accounted for as if the assets were owned and financed.  The components of rental costs are as follows: 

(a) 
    Amounts include lease expenses related to AEP Texas Wind Farms that have been classified as Other Operation Expense from Discontinued Operations on the statements of income in the amount of   $1 million   for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  See Note   7   for additional information. 
              (b) 
    Amounts include lease expenses related to AEPRO that have been classified as Other Operation Expense from Discontinued Operations on the statement of income in the amount of   $89 million   for the year ended December 31, 2015.  See  AEPRO  (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 

312 

The following tables show the property, plant and equipment under capital leases and related obligations recorded on the Registrants  balance sheets.  Unless shown as a separate line on the balance sheets due to materiality, current capital lease obligations are included in Other Current Liabilities and long-term capital lease obligations are included in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Registrants  balance sheets. 

313 

Future minimum lease payments consisted of the following as of December 31,   2017  : 

Master Lease Agreements (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo) 
    
  The Registrants lease certain equipment under master lease agreements.  Under the lease agreements, the lessor is guaranteed a residual value up to a stated percentage of either the unamortized balance or the equipment cost at the end of the lease term.  If the actual fair value of the leased equipment is below the guaranteed residual value at the end of the lease term, the Registrants are committed to pay the difference between the actual fair value and the residual value guarantee.  Historically, at the end of the lease term the fair value has been in excess of the unamortized balance.  As of December 31,   2017  , the maximum potential loss by the Registrants for these lease agreements assuming the fair value of the equipment is zero at the end of the lease term is as follows: 

314 

Rockport Lease (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  AEGCo and I M entered into a sale-and-leaseback transaction in 1989 with Wilmington Trust Company (Owner Trustee), an unrelated, unconsolidated trustee for Rockport Plant, Unit 2 (the Plant).  The Owner Trustee was capitalized with equity from six owner participants with no relationship to AEP or any of its subsidiaries and debt from a syndicate of banks and securities in a private placement to certain institutional investors. 
    
  The gain from the sale was deferred and is being amortized over the term of the lease, which expires in 2022.  The Owner Trustee owns the Plant and leases it equally to AEGCo and I M.  The lease is accounted for as an operating lease with the payment obligations included in the future minimum lease payments schedule earlier in this note.  The lease term is for   33 years   with potential renewal options.  At the end of the lease term, AEGCo and I M have the option to renew the lease or the Owner Trustee can sell the Plant.  AEP, AEGCo and I M have no ownership interest in the Owner Trustee and do not guarantee its debt.  The future minimum lease payments for this sale-and-leaseback transaction as of December 31,   2017   are as follows: 

(a)    AEP s future minimum lease payments include equal shares from AEGCo and I M. 
    
  Railcar Lease (Applies to AEP, I M and SWEPCo) 
    
  In June 2003, AEP Transportation LLC (AEP Transportation), a subsidiary of AEP, entered into an agreement with BTM Capital Corporation, as lessor, to lease 875 coal-transporting aluminum railcars.  The lease is accounted for as an operating lease.  In January 2008, AEP Transportation assigned the remaining 848 railcars under the original lease agreement to I M (390 railcars) and SWEPCo (458 railcars).  The assignment is accounted for as operating leases for I M and SWEPCo.  The initial lease term was five years with three consecutive five-year renewal periods for a maximum lease term of twenty years.  I M and SWEPCo intend to renew these leases for the full lease term of twenty years via the renewal options.  The future minimum lease obligations are   $7 million   and   $8 million   for I M and SWEPCo, respectively, for the remaining railcars as of December 31,   2017  .  These obligations are included in the future minimum lease payments schedule earlier in this note. 
    
  Under the lease agreement, the lessor is guaranteed that the sale proceeds under a return-and-sale option will equal at least a lessee obligation amount specified in the lease, which declines from   83%   of the projected fair value of the equipment under the current five-year lease term to   77%   at the end of the 20-year term.  I M and SWEPCo have assumed the guarantee under the return-and-sale option.  The maximum potential losses related to the guarantee are   $8 million   and   $10 million   for I M and SWEPCo, respectively, as of December 31,   2017  , assuming the fair value of the equipment is zero at the end of the current five-year lease term.  However, management believes that the fair value would produce a sufficient sales price to avoid any loss. 

315 

AEPRO Boat and Barge Leases (Applies to AEP) 
    
  In October 2015, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in November 2015.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7  .  Certain of the boat and barge leases acquired by the nonaffiliated party are subject to an AEP guarantee in favor of the lessor, ensuring future payments under such leases with maturities up to 2027.  As of December 31,   2017  , the maximum potential amount of future payments required under the guaranteed leases was   $50 million  .  In certain instances, AEP has no recourse against the nonaffiliated party if required to pay a lessor under a guarantee, but AEP would have access to sell the leased assets in order to recover payments made by AEP under the guarantee.  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP s boat and barge lease guarantee liability was   $7 million  , of which   $1 million   was recorded in Other Current Liabilities and   $6 million   was recorded in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on AEP s balance sheet. 
    
  I M Nuclear Fuel Lease (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  In November 2013, I M entered into a sale-and-leaseback transaction with IMP 11-2013, a nonaffiliated Ohio trust, to lease nuclear fuel for I M s Cook Plant.  In November 2013, I M sold a portion of its unamortized nuclear fuel inventory to the trust for   $110 million  .  The lease has a variable rate based on one month LIBOR and is accounted for as a capital lease with lease terms up to   54 months  .  The future minimum lease payments for the sales-and-leaseback transaction as of December 31, 2017 are   $2 million   based on estimated fuel burn and will be paid in 2018.  The net capital lease asset is included in Other Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets.  The short-term capital lease obligations are included in Other Current Liabilities on AEP s balance sheets and in Obligations Under Capital Leases on I M s balance sheets.  The long-term capital lease obligations are included in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets.

  Debt Covenants (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo) 
    
  Covenants in AEPTCo s note purchase agreements and indenture limit the amount of contractually-defined priority debt (which includes a further sub-limit of   $50 million   of secured debt) to   10%   of consolidated tangible net assets.   AEPTCo s contractually-defined priority debt was   0.6%   of consolidated tangible net assets as of December 31,2017.  The method for calculating the consolidated tangible net assets is contractually defined in the note purchase agreements. 
    
  Dividend Restrictions 
    
  Utility Subsidiaries  Restrictions 
    
  Parent depends on its utility subsidiaries to pay dividends to shareholders.  AEP utility subsidiaries pay dividends to Parent provided funds are legally available.  Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends. 
  All of the dividends declared by AEP s utility subsidiaries that provide transmission or local distribution services are subject to a Federal Power Act restriction that prohibits the payment of dividends out of capital accounts without regulatory approval; payment of dividends is allowed out of retained earnings only.  Additionally, the Federal Power Act creates a reserve on earnings attributable to hydroelectric generation plants.  Because of their ownership of such plants, this reserve applies to AGR, APCo and I M. 
  
   319 

Certain AEP subsidiaries also have credit agreements that contain covenants that limit their debt to capitalization ratio to   67.5%  .  The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually defined in the credit agreements. 
    
  The most restrictive dividend limitation for certain AEP subsidiaries is through the Federal Power Act restriction, while for other AEP subsidiaries the most restrictive dividend limitation is through the credit agreements.  As of   December 31, 2017  , the maximum amount of restricted net assets of AEP s subsidiaries that may not be distributed to the Parent in the form of a loan, advance or dividend was   $11.4 billion  . 
    
  The Federal Power Act restriction does not limit the ability of the AEP subsidiaries to pay dividends out of retained earnings.  However, the credit agreement covenant restrictions can limit the ability of the AEP subsidiaries to pay dividends out of retained earnings.  As of   December 31, 2017  , the amount of any such restrictions was as follows: 

(a) 
    Includes the restrictions of consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries. 
       
  Parent Restrictions (Applies to AEP) 
    
  The holders of AEP s common stock are entitled to receive the dividends declared by the Board of Directors provided funds are legally available for such dividends.  Parent s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries. 
    
  Pursuant to the leverage restrictions in credit agreements, AEP must maintain a percentage of debt to total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%.  The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually defined in the credit agreements.  As of   December 31, 2017  , AEP had   $7.3 billion   of available retained earnings to pay dividends to common shareholders.  AEP paid   $1.2 billion  ,   $1.1 billion   and   $1.1 billion   of dividends to common shareholders for the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Lines of Credit and Short-term Debt (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
    
  AEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries.  The program is used to fund both a Utility Money Pool, which funds the utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain of the nonutility subsidiaries.  In addition, the program also funds, as direct borrowers, the short-term debt requirements of other subsidiaries that are not participants in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons.  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP had a credit facility for   $3 billion   to support its commercial paper program.  The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during   2017   was   $1.6 billion   and the weighted average interest rate of commercial paper outstanding during   2017   was   1.25%  .  AEP s outstanding short-term debt was as follows: 

(a) 
    Weighted average rate. 
              (b) 
    Amount of securitized debt for receivables as accounted for under the  Transfers and Servicing  accounting guidance. 
     
   320 

Corporate Borrowing Program   AEP System (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries) 
    
  The AEP System uses a corporate borrowing program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of AEP s subsidiaries.  The corporate borrowing program includes a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP s utility subsidiaries,   a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries, and direct borrowing from AEP.  The AEP System Utility Money Pool operates in accordance with the terms and conditions of the AEP System Utility Money Pool agreement filed with the FERC.  The amounts of outstanding loans to (borrowings from) the Utility Money Pool as of December 31,   2017   and   2016   are included in Advances to Affiliates and Advances from Affiliates, respectively, on each of the Registrant Subsidiaries  balance sheets.  The Utility Money Pool participants  money pool activity and their corresponding authorized borrowing limits are described in the following tables:

Credit Facilities 
    
  For a discussion of credit facilities, see  Letters of Credit  section of Note   6  . 
    
  Securitized Accounts Receivables   AEP Credit (Applies to AEP) 
    
  AEP Credit has a receivables securitization agreement with bank conduits.  Under the securitization agreement, AEP Credit receives financing from the bank conduits for the interest in the receivables AEP Credit acquires from affiliated utility subsidiaries.  These securitized transactions allow AEP Credit to repay its outstanding debt obligations, continue to purchase the operating companies  receivables and accelerate AEP Credit s cash collections. 
    
  AEP Credit s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of   $750 million   from bank conduits to purchase receivables and expires in June 2019. 
    
  Accounts receivable information for AEP Credit is as follows: 

AEP Credit s delinquent customer accounts receivable represent accounts greater than 30 days past due. 
    
  Securitized Accounts Receivables   AEP Credit (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries, except AEPTCo and AEP Texas) 
    
  Under this sale of receivables arrangement, the Registrant Subsidiaries sell, without recourse, certain of their customer accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenue balances to AEP Credit and are charged a fee based on AEP Credit s financing costs, administrative costs and uncollectible accounts experience for each Registrant Subsidiary s receivables.  APCo does not have regulatory authority to sell its West Virginia accounts receivable.  The costs of customer accounts receivable sold are reported in Other Operation expense on the Registrant Subsidiaries  statements of income.  The Registrant Subsidiaries manage and service their customer accounts receivable, which are sold to AEP Credit.  AEP Credit securitizes the eligible receivables for the operating companies and retains the remainder. 
    
  The amount of accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues under the sale of receivables agreement for each Registrant Subsidiary were as follows: 

325 

The fees paid by the Registrant Subsidiaries to AEP Credit for customer accounts receivable sold were: 

The Registrant Subsidiaries  proceeds on the sale of receivables to AEP Credit were:

15  .    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to AEP only.  The impact of AEP s share-based compensation plans is insignificant to the financial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries.  
    
  Awards under AEP s long-term incentive plan may be granted to employees and directors.  The Amended and Restated American Electric Power System Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Prior Plan ), was replaced prospectively for new grants by the American Electric Power System 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2015 LTIP ) effective in April 2015.  The 2015 LTIP was subsequently amended in September 2016.  The 2015 LTIP provides for a maximum of   10   million common shares to be available for grant to eligible employees and directors.  As of December 31,   2017  ,   9,011,946   shares remained available for issuance under the 2015 LTIP plan.  No new awards may be granted under the Prior Plan.  The 2015 LTIP awards may be stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance share units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards.  If a share is issued pursuant to a stock option or a stock appreciation right, it will reduce the aggregate amount authorized under the 2015 LTIP by   0.286   of a share.  If a share is issued for any other award that settles in AEP stock, it will reduce the aggregate amount authorized under the 2015 LTIP by one share.  Cash settled awards do not reduce the aggregate amount authorized under the 2015 LTIP.  The following sections provide further information regarding each type of stock-based compensation award granted under these plans. 
    
  Performance Units 
    
  Performance units granted prior to 2017 are settled in cash rather than AEP common stock and do not reduce the aggregate share authorization.  These performance units have a fair value upon vesting equal to the average closing market price of AEP common stock for the last   20   trading days of the performance period.  Performance units granted in 2017 will be settled in AEP common stock and will reduce the aggregate share authorization.  In all cases the number of performance units held at the end of the   three   year performance period is multiplied by the performance score for such period to determine the actual number of performance units realized.  The performance score can range from   0%   to   200%   and is determined at the end of the performance period based on performance measures, which include both performance and market conditions, established for each grant at the beginning of the performance period by the Human Resources Committee of AEP s Board of Directors (HR Committee). 
    
  Certain employees must satisfy stock ownership requirements.  If those employees have not met their stock ownership requirements, a portion or all of their performance units are mandatorily deferred as AEP career shares to the extent needed to meet their stock ownership requirement.  AEP career shares are a form of non-qualified deferred compensation that has a value equivalent to shares of AEP common stock.  AEP career shares are settled in AEP common stock after the participant s termination of employment.   
    
  AEP career shares are recorded in Paid in Capital on the balance sheet.  Amounts equivalent to cash dividends on both performance units and AEP career shares accrue as additional units.  Management records compensation cost for performance units over an approximately three-year vesting period.  The liability for the pre 2017 performance units is recorded in Employee Benefits and Pension Obligations on the balance sheet and is adjusted for changes in value.  Performance units settled in shares are recorded as mezzanine equity on the balance sheet and compensation cost is calculated at fair value using two metrics. Half is based on the total shareholder return measure, which is determined based on a third party Monte Carlo valuation. That metric doesn t change over the three year vesting period.  The other half is based on a three year cumulative earnings per share metric which is adjusted quarterly for changes in performance relative to a target approved by the HR Committee. 

327 

Monte Carlo Valuation 
    
  AEP engaged a third party for a Monte Carlo valuation to calculate half of the fair value for the performance units awarded during 2017.  The valuation used a lattice model and the expected volatility assumption used was the historical volatilities for AEP and the members of their peer group over the last   2.86   years (period from award date to vesting date).  The range of expected volatilities was   15.65%   to   27.19%   with an average expected volatility of   19.07%  .  The dividend rates used were   0%   which is the equivalent to reinvesting dividends.  The risk-free rate used was   1.44%  , which was interpolated between the two year rate of   1.21%   and three year rate of   1.48%   since 2.86 years was the vesting period from award date to vesting date.  
    
  The HR Committee awarded performance units and reinvested dividends on outstanding performance units and AEP career shares for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   as follows: 

(b) 
    The vesting period for the reinvested dividends on performance units is equal to the remaining life of the related performance units.  Dividends on AEP career shares vest immediately when the dividend is awarded but are not settled in AEP common stock until after the participant s AEP employment ends.   
        
  Performance scores and final awards are determined and certified by the HR Committee in accordance with the pre-established performance measures within approximately a month after the end of the performance period.  The performance scores for all performance periods were dependent on   two   equally-weighted performance measures: (a)   three  -year total shareholder return measured relative to a peer group of similar companies (b)   three  -year cumulative earnings per share measured relative to a target approved by the HR Committee. 
    
  The certified performance scores and units earned for the three-year periods ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

328 

The settlements for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Restricted Stock Units 
    
  The HR Committee grants restricted stock units (RSUs), which generally vest, subject to the participant s continued employment, over at least   three   years in approximately equal annual increments.  The RSUs accrue dividends as additional RSUs.  The additional RSUs granted as dividends vest on the same date as the underlying RSUs.  RSUs are converted into shares of AEP common stock upon vesting, except that RSUs granted prior to 2017 that vest to AEP s executive officers are settled in cash.  Executive officers are those officers who are subject to the disclosure requirements set forth in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  For RSUs settled in shares, compensation cost is measured at fair value on the grant date and recorded over the vesting period.  Fair value is determined by multiplying the number of RSUs granted by the grant date market closing price.  For RSUs settled in cash, compensation cost is recorded over the vesting period and adjusted for changes in fair value until vested.  The fair value at vesting is determined by multiplying the number of RSUs vested by the   20  -day average closing price of AEP common stock.  The maximum contractual term of outstanding RSUs is approximately   72 months   from the grant date. 
    
  In 2010, the HR Committee granted a total of   165,520   RSUs to four Chief Executive Officer succession candidates as a retention incentive for these candidates.  These grants vested in three approximately equal installments in August 2013, August 2014 and August 2015.   
    
  The HR Committee awarded RSUs, including additional units awarded as dividends, for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   as follows: 

The total fair value and total intrinsic value of restricted stock units vested during the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

(a) 
    Intrinsic value is calculated as market price at exercise date. 

329 

A summary of the status of AEP s nonvested RSUs as of December 31,   2017   and changes during the year ended December 31,   2017   are as follows: 

The total aggregate intrinsic value of nonvested RSUs as of December 31,   2017   was   $39 million   and the weighted average remaining contractual life was   1.6 years  .  
    
  Other Stock-Based Plans 
    
  AEP also has a Stock Unit Accumulation Plan for Non-Employee Directors providing each non-employee director with AEP stock units as a substantial portion of their quarterly compensation for their services as a director.  The number of stock units provided is based on the closing price of AEP common stock on the last trading day of the quarter for which the stock units were earned.  Amounts equivalent to cash dividends on the stock units accrue as additional AEP stock units.  The stock units granted to Non-Employee Directors are fully vested upon grant date.  Stock units are settled in cash upon termination of board service or up to   10 years   later if the participant so elects.  Cash settlements for stock units are calculated based on the average closing price of AEP common stock for the last   20   trading days prior to the distribution date.  After five years of service on the Board of Directors, non-employee directors receive contributions to an AEP stock fund awarded under the Stock Unit Accumulation Plan.  Such amounts may be exchanged into other market-based investments that are similar to the investment options available to employees that participate in AEP s Incentive Compensation Deferral Plan. 
    
  Management records compensation cost for stock units when the units are awarded and adjusts the liability for changes in value based on the current   20  -day average closing price of AEP common stock on the valuation date. 
    
  For   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , cash settlements for stock unit distributions were immaterial. 
    
  The Board of Directors awarded stock units, including units awarded for dividends, for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   as follows: 

330 

Share-based Compensation Plans 
    
  Compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements, the actual tax benefit from the tax deductions for compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements recognized in income and total compensation cost capitalized in relation to the cost of an asset for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

(a) 
    Compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements is included in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses on the statements of income. 
              (b) 
    In December 2017, Tax Reform modified Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Beginning after 2017, AEP can no longer deduct compensation expense in excess of $1 million for certain named executive officers.  This will reduce the tax benefit going forward. 
       
  As of December 31,   2017  , there was   $64 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2015 LTIP and Prior Plan.  Unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based arrangements will change as the fair value of performance units are adjusted each period and as forfeitures for all award types are realized.  AEP s unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.35 years  .  
    
  Under the 2015 LTIP and Prior Plan, AEP is permitted to use authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, shares acquired in the open market specifically for distribution under these plans, or any combination thereof to fulfill share commitments.  In 2017, AEP used a combination of all three to fulfill share commitments.  AEP s current practice is to use authorized but unissued shares to fulfill share commitments.  The number of shares used to fulfill share commitments is generally reduced to offset AEP s tax withholding obligation.

  Power Coordination Agreement (PCA), Bridge Agreement and Power Supply Agreement (PSA) (Applies to all Registrant Subsidiaries except AEP Texas and AEPTCo) 
    
  Effective January 1, 2014, the FERC approved the following agreements. 

A Power Coordination Agreement (PCA) among APCo, I M and KPCo with AEPSC as the agent to coordinate the participants  respective power supply resources.  Effective May 2015, the PCA was revised and approved by the FERC to include WPCo.  Under the PCA, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo are individually responsible for planning their respective capacity obligations.  Further, the Restated and Amended PCA allows, but does not obligate, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo to participate collectively under a common fixed resource requirement capacity plan in PJM and to participate in specified collective off-system sales and purchase activities.   
                
    A Bridge Agreement among AGR, APCo, I M, KPCo and OPCo with AEPSC as agent.  The Bridge Agreement is an interim arrangement to: (a) address the treatment of purchases and sales made by AEPSC on behalf of member companies that extend beyond termination of the Interconnection Agreement and (b) address how member companies would fulfill their existing obligations under the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement through the 2014/2015 PJM planning year.  Under the Bridge Agreement, AGR committed to use its capacity to help meet the PJM capacity obligations of member companies through the PJM planning year that ended May 31, 2015. 
                
    A Power Supply Agreement (PSA) between AGR and OPCo that provided for AGR to supply capacity for OPCo s switched (at $188.88/MW day) and non-switched retail load for the period January 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015 and to supply the energy needs of OPCo s non-switched retail load that was not acquired through auctions in 2014. 
       
  AEPSC conducts power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other risk management activities on behalf of APCo, I M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.

There are no penalties if AEP Texas fails to maintain a minimum availability level or exceeds a maximum heat rate level.  The PPA was approved by the FERC.  AEP Texas recognizes revenues for the fuel, operations and maintenance and all other taxes as-billed.  Revenue is recognized for the capacity and depreciation billed to AEPEP, on a straight-line basis over the term of the PPA as these represent the minimum payments due. 
    
  AEP Texas recorded revenue of   $64 million  ,   $74 million   and   $77 million   from AEPEP for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  These amounts are included in Sales to AEP Affiliates on AEP Texas  statements of income.

17  .    VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.  
    
  The accounting guidance for  Variable Interest Entities  is a consolidation model that considers if a company has a variable interest in a VIE.  A VIE is a legal entity that possesses any of the following conditions: the entity s equity at risk is not sufficient to permit the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, equity owners are unable to direct the activities that most significantly impact the legal entity s economic performance (or they possess disproportionate voting rights in relation to the economic interest in the legal entity), or the equity owners lack the obligation to absorb the legal entity s expected losses or the right to receive the legal entity s expected residual returns.  Entities are required to consolidate a VIE when it is determined that they have a controlling financial interest in a VIE and therefore, are the primary beneficiary of that VIE, as defined by the accounting guidance for  Variable Interest Entities.   In determining whether AEP is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management considers whether AEP has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and is obligated to absorb losses or receive the expected residual returns that are significant to the VIE.  Management believes that significant assumptions and judgments were applied consistently.  
    
  AEP is the primary beneficiary of Sabine, DCC Fuel, Transition Funding, Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding, Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding, AEP Credit, a protected cell of EIS and Transource Energy.  In addition, AEP has not provided material financial or other support to any of these entities that was not previously contractually required.  AEP holds a significant variable interest in DHLC, OVEC and Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline, LLC West Virginia Series (West Virginia Series). 
    
  Consolidated Variable Interests Entities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo and PSO) 
    
  Sabine is a mining operator providing mining services to SWEPCo.  SWEPCo has no equity investment in Sabine but is Sabine s only customer.  SWEPCo guarantees the debt obligations and lease obligations of Sabine.  Under the terms of the note agreements, substantially all assets are pledged and all rights under the lignite mining agreement are assigned to SWEPCo.  The creditors of Sabine have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo.  Under the provisions of the mining agreement, SWEPCo is required to pay, as a part of the cost of lignite delivered, an amount equal to mining costs plus a management fee.  In addition, SWEPCo determines how much coal will be mined each year.  Based on these facts, management concluded that SWEPCo is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate Sabine.  SWEPCo s total billings from Sabine for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were   $137 million  ,   $162 million   and   $152 million  , respectively.  See the tables below for the classification of Sabine s assets and liabilities on SWEPCo s balance sheets. 
    
  I M has nuclear fuel lease agreements with DCC Fuel, which was formed for the purpose of acquiring, owning and leasing nuclear fuel to I M.  DCC Fuel purchased the nuclear fuel from I M with funds received from the issuance of notes to financial institutions.  Each DCC Fuel entity is a single-lessee leasing arrangement with only one asset and is capitalized with all debt.  Each is a separate legal entity from I M, the assets of which are not available to satisfy the debts of I M.  Payments on the leases for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were   $136 million  ,   $101 million   and   $115 million  , respectively.  The leases were recorded as capital leases on I M s balance sheet as title to the nuclear fuel transfers to I M at the end of the respective lease terms, which do not exceed   54 months  .  Based on I M s control of DCC Fuel, management concluded that I M is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate DCC Fuel.  The capital leases are eliminated upon consolidation.  See the tables below for the classification of DCC Fuel s assets and liabilities on I M s balance sheets. 
    
  Transition Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to Texas Restructuring Legislation.  Management has concluded that AEP Texas is the primary beneficiary of Transition Funding because AEP Texas has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and AEP Texas  equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, AEP Texas is required to consolidate Transition Funding.  The securitized bonds totaled   $1 billion   and   $1.2 billion   as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively, and are included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated and Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets.  Transition  
  
   340 

Funding has securitized transition assets of   $870 million   and   $1.1 billion   as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets.  The securitized transition assets represent the right to impose and collect Texas true-up costs from customers receiving electric transmission or distribution service from AEP Texas under recovery mechanisms approved by the PUCT.  The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized transition assets.  The bondholders have no recourse to AEP Texas or any other AEP entity.  AEP Texas acts as the servicer for Transition Funding s securitized transition assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Transition Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs.  See the tables below for the classification of Transition Funding s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.  
    
  Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to phase-in recovery property.  Management has concluded that OPCo is the primary beneficiary of Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding because OPCo has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and OPCo s equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, OPCo is required to consolidate Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding.  The securitized bonds totaled   $95 million   and   $140 million   as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively, and are included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated and Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets.  Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding has securitized assets of   $38 million   and   $62 million   as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets.  The phase-in recovery property represents the right to impose and collect Ohio deferred distribution charges from customers receiving electric transmission and distribution service from OPCo under a recovery mechanism approved by the PUCO.  In August 2013, securitization bonds were issued.  The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets.  The bondholders have no recourse to OPCo or any other AEP entity.  OPCo acts as the servicer for Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding s securitized assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs.  See the tables below for the classification of Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding s assets and liabilities on OPCo s balance sheets.  
    
  Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to APCo s under-recovered ENEC deferral balance.  Management has concluded that APCo is the primary beneficiary of Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding because APCo has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and APCo s equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, APCo is required to consolidate Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding.  The securitized bonds totaled   $296 million   and   $319 million   as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively, and are included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated and Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets.  Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding has securitized assets of   $282 million   and   $305 million   as of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets.  The phase-in recovery property represents the right to impose and collect West Virginia deferred generation charges from customers receiving electric transmission, distribution and generation service from APCo under a recovery mechanism approved by the WVPSC.  In November 2013, securitization bonds were issued.  The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets.  The bondholders have no recourse to APCo or any other AEP entity.  APCo acts as the servicer for Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding s securitized assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs.  See the tables below for the classification of Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding s assets and liabilities on APCo s balance sheets.  
    
  AEP Credit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.  AEP Credit purchases, without recourse, accounts receivable from certain utility subsidiaries of AEP to reduce working capital requirements.  AEP provides a minimum of   5%   equity and up to   20%   of AEP Credit s short-term borrowing needs in excess of third party financings.  Any third party financing of AEP Credit only has recourse to the receivables securitized for such financing.  Based on AEP s control of AEP Credit, management concluded that AEP is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate AEP Credit.  See the tables below for the classification of AEP Credit s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.  See  Securitized Accounts Receivables - AEP Credit  section of Note   14  . 
  
   341 

AEP s subsidiaries participate in one protected cell of EIS for approximately six lines of insurance.  EIS has multiple protected cells.  Neither AEP nor its subsidiaries have an equity investment in EIS.  The AEP System is essentially this EIS cell s only participant, but allows certain third parties access to this insurance.  AEP s subsidiaries and any allowed third parties share in the insurance coverage, premiums and risk of loss from claims.  Based on AEP s control and the structure of the protected cell of EIS, management concluded that AEP is the primary beneficiary of the protected cell and is required to consolidate the protected cell of EIS.  The insurance premium expense to the protected cell for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was   $29 million  ,   $28 million   and   $29 million  , respectively.  See the tables below for the classification of the protected cell s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.  The amount reported as equity is the protected cell s policy holders  surplus. 
    
  Transource Energy was formed for the purpose of investing in utilities which develop, acquire, construct, own and operate transmission facilities in accordance with FERC-approved rates.  AEP has equity and voting ownership of   86.5%   with the other owner having   13.5%   interest.  Management has concluded that Transource Energy is a VIE and that AEP is the primary beneficiary because AEP has the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity and AEP s equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, AEP is required to consolidate Transource Energy.  In January 2014, Transource Missouri (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transource Energy) acquired transmission assets from the non-controlling owner and issued debt and received a capital contribution to fund the acquisition.  The majority of Transource Energy s activity resulted from the asset acquisition, construction projects, debt issuance and capital contribution.  AEP has provided capital contributions to Transource Energy of   $5 million   and   $45 million  , in   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  AEP and the other owner of Transource Energy are required to ensure a specific equity level in Transource Missouri upon completion of projects or if a project is abandoned by the RTO.  See the tables below for the classification of Transource Energy s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.  
    
  AEP Renewables, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Supply, was formed to provide utility scale wind and solar projects whose power output is sold via long-term power purchase agreements to other utilities, cities and corporations.  In 2016, AEP Renewables acquired solar projects that were funded only through participation in the AEP corporate borrowing program.  As a result, management concluded that AEP Renewables was a VIE and that Energy Supply was the primary beneficiary due to its capacity to direct the most significant activities of the entity and it s equity interest could potentially be significant.  In the first quarter of 2017, AEP Renewables received a capital contribution of   $140 million   from Energy Supply.  The capital contribution gave AEP Renewables sufficient equity at risk, which resulted in the definition of a VIE no longer being met.  Energy Supply continues to consolidate AEP Renewables in accordance with other applicable accounting guidance for  Consolidation  due to its controlling financial interest as the owner of AEP Renewables.  See the tables below for the classification of AEP Renewables  assets and liabilities on the December 31, 2016 balance sheet.

Non-Consolidated Significant Variable Interests 
    
  DHLC is a mining operator which sells   50%   of the lignite produced to SWEPCo and   50%   to CLECO.  The operations of DHLC are governed by the lignite mining agreement among SWEPCo, CLECO and DHLC.  SWEPCo and CLECO share the executive board seats and voting rights equally.  In accordance with the lignite mining agreement, each entity is responsible for   50%   of DHLC s obligations, including debt.  SWEPCo and CLECO equally approve DHLC s annual budget.  The creditors of DHLC have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo.  As SWEPCo is the sole equity owner of DHLC, it receives   100%   of the management fee.  SWEPCo s total billings from DHLC for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were   $61 million  ,   $65 million   and   $93 million  , respectively.  SWEPCo is not required to consolidate DHLC as it is not the primary beneficiary, although SWEPCo holds a significant variable interest in DHLC.  SWEPCo s equity investment in DHLC is included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on SWEPCo s balance sheets. 
    
  SWEPCo s investment in DHLC was: 

AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC.  As of December 31,   2017  , AEP s ownership in OVEC was   43.47%  .  Parent owns   39.17%   and OPCo owns   4.3%  .  APCo, I M and OPCo are members to an intercompany power agreement.  The Registrants  power participation ratios are   15.69%   for APCo,   7.85%   for I M and   19.93%   for OPCo.  Participants of this agreement are entitled to receive and obligated to pay for all OVEC generating capacity, approximately   2,400   MWs, in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of certain AEP utility subsidiaries is   43.47%  .  The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs, including outstanding indebtedness, and provide a return on capital.  The intercompany power agreement ends in June   2040  . 
    
  AEP and other nonaffiliated owners authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests.  OVEC financed capital expenditures in connection with the engineering and construction of FGD projects and the associated waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants.  These environmental projects were funded through debt issuances.  As of December 31,   2017  , OVEC s outstanding indebtedness is approximately   $1.4 billion  .  Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, the Registrants  are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC s outstanding debt through the intercompany power agreement.  Principal and interest payments related to OVEC s outstanding indebtedness are disclosed in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Commitments.   See the  Commitments  section of Note   6  . 
    
  AEP is not required to consolidate OVEC as it is not the primary beneficiary, although AEP and its subsidiaries hold a significant variable interest in OVEC.  Power to control decision making that significantly impact the economic performance of OVEC is shared amongst the owners through their representation on the Board of Directors and Operating Committee of OVEC.

AEP s equity investment in PATH-WV is included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets.  AEP and FirstEnergy share the returns and losses equally in PATH-WV.  AEP s subsidiaries and FirstEnergy s subsidiaries provide services to the PATH companies through service agreements.  The entities recover costs through regulated rates. 
    
  In August 2012, the PJM board cancelled the PATH Project, the transmission project that PATH was intended to develop and removed it from the 2012 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan.  In September 2012, the PATH Project companies submitted an application to the FERC requesting authority to recover prudently-incurred costs associated with the PATH Project.  In November 2012, the FERC issued an order accepting the PATH Project s abandonment cost recovery application, subject to settlement procedures and hearing.  The parties to the case were unable to reach a settlement agreement and in March 2014, settlement judge procedures were terminated.  Hearings at the FERC were held in March and April 2015.  In April 2015, PATH filed a stipulation agreement with the FERC that agreed to a   50%   debt and   50%   equity capital structure and a   4.7%   cost of long-term debt for the entire amortization period.  In September 2015, the ALJ issued an advisory Initial Decision.  Additional briefing was submitted during the fourth quarter of 2015.  In January 2017, the FERC issued its order on Initial Decision, adopting in part and rejecting in part the ALJ s recommendations.  The FERC order included (a) a finding that the PATH Project s abandonment costs were prudently incurred, (b) a finding that the disposition of certain assets was prudent, (c) guidance regarding the future disposition of assets, (d) a reduction of PATH WV s authorized  return on equity (ROE) to   8.11%   prospectively only after the date of the order, (e) an adjustment of the amortization period to end December 2017, and (f) a credit for certain amounts that were deemed to be not includable in PATH-WV s formula rates. 

346 

In February 2017, the PATH Companies filed a request for rehearing of two adverse rulings in the January 2017 FERC order.  The request seeks the FERC to reverse its reduction of the PATH Companies   10.4%   ROE for the period after January 19, 2017 and to allow the recovery of certain education and outreach costs disallowed by the order.  In February 2017, the Edison Electric Institute ( EEI ) also filed a request for rehearing recommending reversal of the January 2017 FERC ordered ROE reduction and cost disallowance.  The requests for rehearing by the PATH Companies and EEI are currently pending before the FERC.  The requests for rehearing do not impact the recovery of costs by the PATH Companies under their formula rates or the timing of the compliance filing required by the order, which was filed in March 2017, and updated in May 2017 and August 2017.  As a result of the January 2017 FERC order, PATH-WV is required to refund certain amounts that have been collected under its formula rate in its 2018 Projected Transmission Revenue Requirement.  PATH-WV will refund   $11.4 million  , including carrying charges, related to the January 2017 order in its 2018 Projected Transmission Revenue Requirement.  
    
  AEP s investment in PATH-WV was: 

As of December 31,   2017  , AEP s   $17 million   investment in PATH-WV was included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheet.  If AEP cannot ultimately recover the investment related to PATH-WV, it could reduce future net income and cash flows.  
    
  AEPSC provides certain managerial and professional services to AEP s subsidiaries.  Parent is the sole equity owner of AEPSC.  AEP management controls the activities of AEPSC.  The costs of the services are based on a direct charge or on a prorated basis and billed to the AEP subsidiary companies at AEPSC s cost.  AEP subsidiaries have not provided financial or other support outside of the reimbursement of costs for services rendered.  AEPSC finances its operations through cost reimbursement from other AEP subsidiaries.  There are no other terms or arrangements between AEPSC and any of the AEP subsidiaries that could require additional financial support from an AEP subsidiary or expose them to losses outside of the normal course of business.  AEPSC and its billings are subject to regulation by the FERC.  AEP subsidiaries are exposed to losses to the extent they cannot recover the costs of AEPSC through their normal business operations.  AEP subsidiaries are considered to have a significant interest in AEPSC due to their activity in AEPSC s cost reimbursement structure.  However, AEP subsidiaries do not have control over AEPSC.  AEPSC is consolidated by AEP.  In the event AEPSC would require financing or other support outside the cost reimbursement billings, this financing would be provided by AEP. 
    
  Total AEPSC billings to the Registrant Subsidiaries were as follows: 

347 

The carrying amount and classification of variable interest in AEPSC s accounts payable are as follows: 

AEGCo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, is consolidated by AEP.  AEGCo owns a   50%   ownership interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 1, leases a   50%   interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 and owned   100%   of the Lawrenceburg Generating Station, which was sold in January 2017.  AEGCo sells all the output from the Rockport Plant to I M and KPCo.  AEP has agreed to provide AEGCo with the funds necessary to satisfy all of the debt obligations of AEGCo.  I M is considered to have a significant interest in AEGCo due to these transactions.  I M is exposed to losses to the extent it cannot recover the costs of AEGCo through its normal business operations.  In the event AEGCo would require financing or other support outside the billings to I M and KPCo, this financing would be provided by AEP.  Total billings to I M from AEGCo for the years ended December 31,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were   $224 million  ,   $229 million   and   $232 million  .  The carrying amount of I M s liabilities associated with AEGCo as of December 31,   2017   and   2016   was   $23 million   and   $22 million  , respectively.  Management estimates the maximum exposure of loss to be equal to the amount of such liability.  For additional information regarding AEGCo s lease, see  Rockport Lease  section of Note   13  .  The assets and liabilities of AEGCo s Lawrenceburg Plant have been recorded as Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Held for Sale, respectively, on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.  See  Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale  section of Note   7   for additional information. 

348 

18  .    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  Property, Plant and Equipment is shown functionally on the face of the Registrants  balance sheets.  The following tables include the Registrants  total plant balances as of   December 31, 2017 and 2016  : 

(a) 
    AEP and SWEPCo s regulated generation and regulated CWIP include amounts related to SWEPCo s Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant. 
              (b) 
    Amount excludes   $1.8   billion of Property, Plant and Equipment - Net classified as Assets Held for Sale on the balance sheet.  See  Gavin, Waterford, Darby and Lawrenceburg Plants (Generation   Marketing Segment)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 

349 

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 
    
  The Registrants provide for depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment, excluding coal-mining properties, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, generally using composite rates by functional class.  The following tables provide total regulated annual composite depreciation rates and depreciable lives for the Registrants: 

350 

The following table includes the nonregulated annual composite depreciation rate ranges and nonregulated depreciable life ranges for AEP, AEP Texas and SWEPCo.  Depreciation rate ranges and depreciable life ranges are not meaningful for nonregulated property of AEPTCo, APCo, I M, OPCo and PSO for   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  . 

(a) 
    SWEPCo s nonregulated property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over a range of   3   to   20   years. 
       
  SWEPCo provides for depreciation, depletion and amortization of coal-mining assets over each asset s estimated useful life or the estimated life of each mine, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method for mining structures and equipment.  SWEPCo uses either the straight-line method or the units-of-production method to amortize mine development costs and deplete coal rights based on estimated recoverable tonnages.  SWEPCo includes these costs in fuel expense. 
    
  For regulated operations, the composite depreciation rate generally includes a component for non-asset retirement obligation (non-ARO) removal costs, which is credited to Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization on the balance sheets.  Actual removal costs incurred are charged to Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization.  Any excess of accrued non-ARO removal costs over actual removal costs incurred is reclassified from Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization and reflected as a regulatory liability.  For nonregulated operations, non-ARO removal costs are expensed as incurred.   
    
  Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo) 
    
  The Registrants record ARO in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations  for legal obligations for asbestos removal and for the retirement of certain ash disposal facilities, closure and monitoring of underground carbon storage facilities at Mountaineer Plant, wind farms and certain coal mining facilities.  I M records ARO for the decommissioning of the Cook Plant.  The Registrants have identified, but not recognized, ARO liabilities related to electric transmission and distribution assets as a result of certain easements on property on which assets are owned.  Generally, such easements are perpetual and require only the retirement and removal of assets upon the cessation of the property s use.  The retirement obligation is not estimable for such easements  
  
   351 

since the Registrants plan to use their facilities indefinitely.  The retirement obligation would only be recognized if and when the Registrants abandon or cease the use of specific easements, which is not expected. 
    
  As of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , I M s ARO liability for nuclear decommissioning of the Cook Plant was   $1.30 billion   and   $1.24 billion  , respectively.  These liabilities are reflected in Asset Retirement Obligations on I M s balance sheets.  As of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , the fair value of I M s assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling decommissioning liabilities totaled   $2.22 billion   and   $1.95 billion  , respectively.  These assets are included in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on I M s balance sheets. 
    
  The following is a reconciliation of the   2017   and   2016   aggregate carrying amounts of ARO by Registrant:  

(a) 
    Includes ARO related to ash disposal facilities. 
               (c) 
    Includes ARO related to Sabine and DHLC. 
              (d) 
    Includes ARO related to asbestos removal.
