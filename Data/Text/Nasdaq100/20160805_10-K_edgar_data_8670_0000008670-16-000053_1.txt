COMPETITION 
  The industries in which ADP operates are highly competitive.  ADP knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors, but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of HR outsourcing solutions in the world.  Employer Services competes with other business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services, providers of cloud-based HCM solutions and financial institutions.  PEO Services competes with other PEOs providing similar services, as well as business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services and providers of cloud-based HCM solutions.  Other competitive factors include a company s in-house function, whereby a company installs and operates its own business processing systems. 
  Competition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on service and product quality, reputation, ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of services and products, and price. We believe that ADP is competitive in each of these areas and that our commitment to service excellence, together with our leading-edge technology, distinguishes us from our competitors. 
  INDUSTRY REGULATION 
  Our business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations.  In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them.  We have, and continue to enhance, compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our operations and client solutions, including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs. 
  As one of the world s largest providers of HR outsourcing solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees.  We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy and data security-related laws.  For instance, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 applies to our COBRA, flexible spending account and insurance services businesses, and ADP TotalSource. We are also subject to federal, state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data.  Additionally, the changing nature of privacy laws in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere, including the invalidation in the European Union of the Safe Harbor Principles for the transfer of personal data between the European Union and the United States and the adoption by the European Union of a general data protection regulation, will impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. 
  As part of our payroll and payroll tax management services, we move client funds to taxing authorities and our clients  employees via electronic transfer, direct deposit, prepaid access and ADPCheck.  Certain elements of our U.S. money transmission activities, including our electronic payment and prepaid access (payroll pay card) offerings, are subject to certain licensing requirements.  In addition, our U.S. prepaid access offering is subject to the anti-money laundering and reporting provisions of The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2000 (the  BSA ).  Elements of our money transmission activities outside of the United States are subject to similar licensing and anti-money laundering and reporting laws and requirements in the countries in which we provide such services.  Our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  ADP TotalSource is subject to various state licensing requirements.  Because ADP TotalSource is a co-employer with respect to its clients  worksite employees, we may be subject to certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax, insurance and employment laws. 
  In addition, many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them.  Although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to ADP, changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations, products and services.  For example, our HCM solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States.  Our COBRA administration services and flexible spending account services in the United States are designed to help our clients comply with relevant federal guidelines relating to, respectively, employers  benefits continuation obligations and the requirements of Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Similarly, our Tax Credit Services business, which helps clients in the United States take advantage of tax credit opportunities as they hire new employees, is based on federal, state, or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits. 
  The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing and impacting our business.  See the discussion contained in the  Risk Factors  section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for

information regarding changes in laws and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences. 
  CLIENTS AND CLIENT CONTRACTS 
  ADP provides its services to more than 650,000 clients.  In fiscal 2016, no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2% of ADP s annual consolidated revenues. 
  ADP is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients.  Depending on the service agreement and/or the size of the client, the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time for a small Employer Services client (as little as 24 hours) to a longer period for a large Employer Services client with multiple deliverables (generally six to twelve months), and in some cases may exceed two years for a large GlobalView client or other large, complicated implementation.  Although we monitor sales that have not yet been installed, we do not view this metric as material to an understanding of our overall business in light of the recurring nature of our business.  This metric is not a reported number, but it is used by management as a planning tool to allocate resources needed to install services, and as a means of assessing our performance against the expectations of our clients.  In addition, some of our products and services are sold under longer term contracts with initial terms ranging from two to seven years.  However, this anticipated future revenue under contract is not a significant portion of ADP s expected future revenue, is not a meaningful indicator of our future performance and is not used by management internally to estimate ADP s future revenue. 
  Our business is typically characterized by long-term client relationships that result in recurring revenue.  Our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions.  No one price quotation or service agreement is material to ADP.  ADP s client retention is estimated at approximately 11 years in Employer Services, and approximately 7 years in PEO Services, and has not varied significantly from period to period. 
  PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
  ADP continually upgrades, enhances, and expands its solutions and services.  In general, new solutions and services supplement rather than replace our existing solutions and services and, given our recurring revenue model, do not have a material and immediate effect on ADP's revenues. ADP believes that our strategic solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles. 
  SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING 
  During the fiscal years ended June 30,   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , ADP invested approximately $818 million, $767 million, and $686 million, respectively, from continuing operations, in systems development and programming, which includes expenses for activities such as client migrations to our new strategic platforms, the development of new products and maintenance of our existing technologies, including purchases of new software and software licenses. 
  LICENSES 
  ADP is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases.  ADP s business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses.  Third-party licenses, patents, trademarks, and franchises are not material to ADP s business as a whole. 
  NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES 
  ADP employed approximately 57,000 persons as of   June 30, 2016  . 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  Our businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate.  Risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business.  The following information should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  This discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements.  You should refer to the description of the  
  
   9 

qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time, and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business. 
  Failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences 
  Our business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations described in the  Industry Regulation  section in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.  
  In addition, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business.  For example, a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and, thereby adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities.  Changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income.  Changes in laws that govern the co-employment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our PEO business.  Health care reform under the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, related state laws, and the regulations adopted or to be adopted thereunder, have the potential to impact substantially the way that employers provide health insurance to employees and the health insurance market for the small and mid-sized businesses that constitute our PEO business s clients and prospects.  We are unable to determine the ultimate impact that health care reform will have on our PEO business and our ability to attract and retain PEO clients. 
  Amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to obtain licenses in some jurisdictions.  The adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions, changes in regulators  interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations, or disagreement by a regulatory authority with our interpretation of such existing statutes or regulations, could require additional registration or licensing, limit certain of our business activities until they are appropriately licensed, and expose us to financial penalties.  These occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or client funds investment strategy, which could adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted. 
  Failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences 
  Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.  Such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, which could adversely impact our business.  We operate our business around the world, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the  FCPA ) and the U.K. Bribery Act.  Such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government     officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  We are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ), which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others.  In addition, some of our businesses in the U.S. and a number of countries in which we operate are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including, for example, the BSA.  Among other things, the BSA requires certain financial institutions, including banks and money services businesses (such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access), to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records. We have registered our payroll card business with the Treasury Department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( FinCEN ) as a provider of prepaid access pursuant to a FinCEN regulation.   
  We have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and we are continuously in the process of  
  
   10 

reviewing, upgrading and enhancing certain of our policies and procedures; however, there can be no assurance that none of our employees, consultants or agents will take actions in violation of our policies, for which we may be ultimately responsible, or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators.  Any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. Further, bank regulators are imposing additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their BSA obligations, and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses, as a class, to be higher risk customers for money laundering.  As a result, our banking partners may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional requirements on us.  These regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks  internal risk-based policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us, may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business, may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. 
  Failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences 
  The collection, hosting, transfer, disclosure, use, storage and security of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal, state and foreign data privacy laws.  These laws, which are not uniform, do one or more of the following: regulate the collection, transfer (including in some cases, the transfer outside the country of collection), processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices; give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information; and prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing.  Under certain circumstances, some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, data protection authorities and/or other regulators in the event of a data breach.  In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries.  In addition, the European Union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation (the  GDPR ) in May 2016 that will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation.  The GDPR will become fully effective in May 2018.  We are analyzing the GDPR to determine its potential effects on our business practices, and are awaiting anticipated guidance from European Union regulators. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices.  Further, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase.  The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.   
  Our businesses collect, host, transfer, disclose, use, store and secure personal and business information, and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses 
  In connection with our business, we collect, host, transfer, disclose, use, store and secure large amounts of personal and business information about our clients, employees of our clients, our vendors and our employees, contractors and temporary staff, including payroll information, health care information, personal and business financial data, social security numbers and their foreign equivalents, bank account numbers, tax information and other sensitive personal and business information. 
  We are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information, and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes.  Nonetheless, globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses.  Although this is a global problem, it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent third-parties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect, host, use, transmit and store. 
  We have programs in place to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents.  However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive measures.   
  In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or  
  
   11 

our systems.  Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third-parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other methods of deceiving our employees, contractors, and temporary staff.  As these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.  In addition, while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information, we do not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients, vendors or their respective employees, and, in any event, third-parties may be able to circumvent those security measures. 
  Any cyber attack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, theft of non-public or other sensitive information, or similar act by a malevolent party, or inadvertent acts by our own employees, contractors or temporary staff, could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, and could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations, or that of our clients, create financial liability, regulatory sanction or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients, or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider.   
  Although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us, a data security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  While ADP maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk. 
  Our systems may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation 
  Many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of complicated transactions.  We rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems.  If any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.  We have disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events.  Despite our preparations, our plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities. 
  If we fail to adapt our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish 
  Our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences.  In order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands, we continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our existing solutions and services.  If we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish. 
  Political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 
  Trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility.  When there is a slowdown in the economy, employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses.  Clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.   
  We invest our client funds in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents.  Nevertheless, our client fund assets are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks.  These risks may be exacerbated, individually or in unison, during periods of unusual financial market volatility.  In addition, as part of our client funds investment strategy, we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  In order to satisfy these short term funding requirements, we maintain access to various sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities, our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances.  A reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial  
  
   12 

markets or otherwise may require us to sell client fund assets to satisfy our short-term funding requirements, which may result in the recognition of losses and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 
  We are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll, tax and other money movement services.  While we have contingency plans in place for bank failures, a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll, tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity. 
  We derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the United States and, as a result, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
  Change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 
  The major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us very strong, investment grade long-term debt ratings and the highest commercial paper ratings.  Failure to maintain high credit ratings on long-term and short-term debt could increase our cost of borrowing, reduce our ability to obtain intra-day borrowing required by our Employer Services business, and adversely impact our results of operations. 
  If the distribution of CDK Global  common stock to ADP s stockholders does not qualify as a tax-free spinoff, we could incur substantial liabilities and may not be fully indemnified for such liabilities 
  On September 30, 2014, the Company completed the tax-free spinoff of its former Dealer Services business through the distribution of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of CDK Global, Inc. ( CDK Global ) to ADP s stockholders.  CDK Global was formed to hold ADP s former Dealer Services business and, as a result of the distribution, became an independent public company trading under the symbol  CDK  on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.  Prior to completing the spinoff of CDK Global, ADP received an opinion from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton   Garrison LLP, its counsel, to the effect that, based on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings set forth in the opinion, the distribution qualified as a transaction that is tax-free under Section 355 and other related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  ADP also received a private letter ruling from the IRS with respect to certain discrete and significant issues arising in connection with the transactions effected in connection with the separation and distribution.  The opinion and the ruling were based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by ADP and CDK Global.  If any of those factual representations or assumptions was untrue or incomplete in any material respect, any undertaking is not complied with, or the facts upon which the opinion and the ruling were based were materially different from the facts at the time of the distribution, the distribution may not qualify for tax-free treatment.  Although a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, the IRS did not rule that the distribution satisfies every requirement for a tax-free distribution. Opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or the courts. As a result, the conclusions expressed in an opinion of counsel could be challenged by the IRS, and if the IRS prevails in such challenge, the tax consequences to ADP s stockholders that received CDK Global common stock pursuant to the distribution could be materially less favorable. 
  If the distribution were determined not to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code, each United States holder of ADP common stock that received CDK Global common stock pursuant to the distribution generally would be treated as receiving a distribution taxable as a dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of CDK Global common stock received by such holder.  In addition, ADP generally would recognize gain with respect to the distribution and certain related transactions, and CDK Global could be required to indemnify ADP for any resulting taxes and related expenses, which could be material.  The distribution and certain related transactions could be taxable to ADP if CDK Global or its stockholders were to engage in certain transactions after the distribution.  In such cases, ADP or its stockholders that received CDK Global common stock pursuant to the spinoff could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and CDK Global could be required to indemnify ADP for any resulting taxes and related expenses, which could be material.  CDK Global may be unable to indemnify us fully for any such taxes and related expenses. 
  We may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 
  Our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients.  Competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and, if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel, results of our operations may suffer.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
  None. 
   
  Item 2. Properties 
  ADP owns 10 of its processing/print centers, and 17 other operational offices, sales offices, and its corporate headquarters in Roseland, New Jersey, which aggregate approximately 3,458,692 square feet.  None of ADP's owned facilities is subject to any material encumbrances.  ADP leases space for some of its processing centers, other operational offices, and sales offices.  All of these leases, which aggregate approximately 6,313,800 square feet worldwide, expire at various times up to the year 2027.  ADP believes its facilities are currently adequate for their intended purposes and are adequately maintained  . 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
  In the normal course of business, ADP is subject to various claims and litigation.  While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, ADP believes that it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a materially adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Part II 
   
  Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  Market for Registrant's Common Equity 
  The principal market for the Company s common stock is the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADP.  The following table sets forth the reported high and low sales prices of the Company s common stock reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the cash dividends per share of common stock declared during each quarter for the two most recent fiscal years.  As of   June 30, 2016  , there were 42,827 holders of record of the Company s common stock.  As of such date, 537,352 additional holders held their common stock in  street name.  

On September 30, 2014, we spun off our former Dealer Services business to our stockholders.  Each of our stockholders of record after the market close on September 24, 2014 received one share of common stock of CDK Global, Inc. for every three shares of the Company s common stock.  In the table above, stock prices prior to September 30, 2014 have not been adjusted for the impact of the spin off.  Stock prices beginning on October 1, 2014 reflect the impact of the spin off.

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data 
    
  The following selected financial data is derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe better reflect the underlying operations of our business model, allows investors to assess our performance in a manner similar to the method used by management, and improves our ability to understand and assess our operating performance against prior periods.  Refer to (A) below for additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures and our reconciliations to reported results. Additionally, prior period amounts have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations (refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). 

. 

(A) Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The following table reconciles our reported results to adjusted results that exclude our provision for income taxes; certain interest amounts; the charges related to our workforce optimization effort in the year ended June 30, 2016 ("fiscal 2016"); the gain on the sale of assets, which includes a building in fiscal 2016 and assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third party expense management platform in the year ended June 30, 2012; the gain on the sale of our AdvancedMD ("AMD") business in fiscal 2016; and a goodwill impairment charge related to our AMD business in the year ended June 30, 2013 ("fiscal 2013").  We use certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods.  We believe that the exclusion of these  items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations, against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  We believe that these adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  Generally, the nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Specifically, we have excluded the impact of certain interest expense (as a result of the issuance of our $2.0 billion fixed-rate notes in September    
  
   18 

2015 - refer to Note   8   of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and certain interest income from adjusted earnings from continuing operations before interest and income taxes ("Adjusted EBIT") and have also excluded certain interest expense and certain interest income in prior years for comparability.  However, we continue to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model.  The amounts included as adjustments in the table below represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "All other interest expense" and "All other interest income."  The charges related to our workforce optimization effort represent severance charges.  Severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results.  Unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to a broad-based, company-wide workforce optimization effort.  Since Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and Adjusted diluted earnings per share ( Adjusted diluted EPS ) from continuing operations are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ), they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to net earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.   

19 

(B)      Return on Equity 
    
  Return on equity from continuing operations has been calculated as net earnings from continuing operations divided by average total stockholders' equity.  Our ROE for fiscal 2016 includes the gain on the sale of assets, the gain on the sale of AMD, and the charges related to our workforce optimization effort which did not significantly impact the ROE calculation.  Our ROE for fiscal 2013 includes the impact of a goodwill impairment charge which decreased ROE by   0.6%  .  Our ROE for fiscal 2012 includes the impact from the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform which increased ROE by   0.6%  .  
    
  (C)  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  To calculate the provision for income taxes on non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at an Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations we use the marginal tax rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment and then adjust for differences in the book vs. tax basis.  The goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2013 was non tax-deductible.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  
    
  We are one of the largest providers of cloud-based Human Capital Management ("HCM") solutions - including payroll, talent management, Human Resources and benefits administration, and time and attendance management - to employers around the world.  As a leader in this industry, we are focused on driving product innovation, enhancing our distribution and service capabilities, and assisting our clients with their HCM needs in the face of ever increasing regulatory complexity.   
    
  Highlights from our   2016   fiscal year include: 

Revenue grew   7%  ;   8%   on a constant dollar basis 
                 
    Net earnings from continuing operations increased   8%  ; Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations grew   9% 
                
    Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to   $3.25   from   $2.89   in the prior year; Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to   $3.26   from   $2.89   in the prior year 
                
    Enhanced our capital structure by issuing   $2 billion   of senior notes 
                
    Continued our shareholder friendly actions by returning   $1.2 billion   via share repurchases and over   $900 million   via dividends, which increased on a per-share basis for the   41   st    consecutive year  
                
    Delivered nearly 10 million Form 1095-Cs to client employees to assist with the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") reporting requirements 

20 

During the year ended June 30, 2016 ("fiscal   2016  "), we continued to focus on our global HCM strategy and our results reflect the strength of our underlying business model, our success in the market, and our focus on growth.  This focus is evidenced by our investments in product innovation, service, and our sales force, as well as the disposition of the Advanced MD ("AMD") business.   
  Our focus on product innovation, the high demand for additional HCM solutions (including products that assist businesses in complying with the ACA), investments in and productivity of our salesforce, and continued positive economic growth in the United States of America ("U.S."), led our sales force to deliver strong new business bookings during fiscal   2016  .  Our sales force's ability to sell to new and existing clients as well as our implementation team's ability to implement new clients on our solutions and implement new services to existing clients drove solid revenue growth during fiscal   2016  .  In the second half of fiscal year   2016  , we began to see a contribution to revenue growth from our ACA compliance solutions, as our upfront investments in selling and implementation of these products in late fiscal   2015   and throughout fiscal   2016   began to translate into recurring revenue. 
  This revenue growth was apparent within both of our business segments during fiscal   2016   despite pressure on Employer Services revenues from foreign currency translation.  Revenue retention declined compared to fiscal   2015   primarily due to elevated losses on our legacy client platforms.  This metric continues to be a point of internal focus as we upgrade our clients from legacy platforms to our new modern cloud-based solutions and focus on improving the client experience.  Our revenue growth also benefited from the continued increase in our pays per control metric, which we measure as the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions.  
  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we incurred a   $48 million   charge for a broad-based workforce optimization effort undertaken during the period.  Additionally, in July 2016, we announced a multi-year service alignment initiative intended to align our client service operations with our platform simplification strategy.  In connection with this service alignment initiative, we anticipate incurring pre-tax charges of $100 million to $125 million through the year ended June 30, 2018.  
  We have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, good margins, the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements.  Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at   June 30, 2016  , with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $  3.2 billion  .  Additionally, during fiscal   2016  , we changed our capital structure via the issuance of   $2 billion   in senior notes, the proceeds of which we have begun to return to shareholders via share repurchases.  The introduction of long-term debt to our capital structure and the anticipated share repurchases are intended to enhance total shareholder return over the longer term. 
  Fiscal 2016 was another exciting and dynamic year that showcased our agility as we continued to adapt to the evolving needs of our clients and the changing regulatory environment within our HCM industry as evidenced by our ability to respond to the challenges presented by the ACA.  We continue to be pleased with the success of our sales operations, our ability to continuously innovate and offer new and exciting products to our clients, and the ability of our service organization to adapt to these new services and strategic platforms.  Exiting fiscal 2016, we believe that our efforts during the fiscal year, in conjunction with our service alignment initiative announced in July, positions us well as we head into fiscal 2017.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

Note 1.  Non-GAAP measures 
    
  Within the tables above and below, we use the term "constant dollar basis" so that certain financial measures can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of business performance.  The financial results on a "constant dollar basis" are determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year.  We believe "constant dollar basis" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations.  Our constant dollar results are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to the U.S. GAAP measures presented. 
    
  The following table reconciles our reported results to adjusted results that exclude our provision for income taxes; certain interest amounts; the charges related to our workforce optimization effort; the gain on the sale of a building; and the gain on the sale of our AMD business in fiscal 2016.  We use certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods.  We believe that the exclusion of these items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations, against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  We believe that these adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  Generally, the nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Specifically, we have excluded the impact of certain interest expense (as a result of the issuance of our   $2.0 billion   fixed-rate notes in September 2015 - refer to Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and interest income from adjusted earnings from continuing operations before interest and income taxes ("Adjusted EBIT") and have also excluded certain interest expense and certain interest income in prior years for comparability.  However, we continue to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model.  The amounts included as adjustments in the table below represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "All other interest expense" and "All other interest income."  The charges related to our workforce optimization effort represent severance charges.  Severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results.  Unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to a broad-based, company-wide workforce optimization effort.  Since Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted provision for income taxes, Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations, Adjusted diluted earnings per share ("Adjusted diluted EPS") from continuing operations and Adjusted EBIT margin are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, provision for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.   

23 

(a) - The tax on the gain on the sale of the AMD business was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference primarily due to a previously recorded non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge. 
    
  (b) - The tax provision/benefit on the gain on the sale of the building and the workforce optimization effort was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. 
    
  (c) - The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes.

Fiscal   2016   Compared to Fiscal   2015    
    
  Total Revenues 
    
  Our revenues, as reported,   increase  d   7%   in fiscal   2016  , despite   two   percentage points of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the disposition of the AMD business in September 2015, primarily due to new business started during the past twelve months from new business bookings growth.  Refer to  Analysis of Reportable Segments  for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") Services. 
    
  Total revenues in fiscal   2016   include interest on funds held for clients of   $377.3 million  , as compared to   $377.7 million   in fiscal   2015  .  The   decrease   in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned in fiscal   2016  , as compared to fiscal   2015  , partially offset by the   increase   in our average client funds balances of   2.8%   to   $22,418.7 million   in fiscal   2016  . 
    
  Total Expenses 
    
  Our total expenses, as reported,   increase  d   7%   in fiscal   2016  , as compared to the same period in the prior year.  The   increase   is primarily due to an   increase   in PEO services pass-through costs as well as an increase in selling and implementation expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced continued demand for additional HCM solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the ACA.  Total expenses also   increase  d due to   increase  d costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, and an increase in severance expenses, primarily related to our workforce optimization effort.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.  
    
  Operating expenses, as reported,   increase  d   7%   in fiscal   2016  , as compared to fiscal   2015  .  PEO Services pass-through costs were   $2,336.3 million   for fiscal   2016  , which included costs for benefits coverage of   $1,906.0 million   and costs for workers  compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of   $430.3 million  .  These pass-through costs were   $2,015.9 million   for fiscal   2015  , which included costs for benefits coverage of   $1,627.1 million   and costs for workers  compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of   $388.8 million  .  Additionally, operating expenses   increase  d due to higher costs to implement and service our client base in support of our growing revenue, including products that assist with ACA compliance which contributed to our strong new business bookings over the past several quarters.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation. 
    
  Systems development and programming costs, as reported,   increased     1%   in fiscal   2016  , when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects and the impact of foreign currency translation. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported,   increased     6%   in fiscal   2016  , as compared to fiscal   2015  .  The   increase   was primarily related to an increase in selling expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced continued demand for our HCM products, particularly those that are designed to assist businesses in complying with the ACA.  Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to   $57.6 million   of additional severance charges, of which   $48.2 million   relate to our workforce optimization effort, and a   $10.7 million   reversal of reserves in fiscal   2015   related to our former Dealer Services business financing arrangements which were sold to a third party.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation. 
    
  Other Income, net 

25 

Other income, net,   increase  d   $37.2 million   in fiscal   2016  , as compared to fiscal   2015  .  The   increase   was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the AMD business of   $29.1 million   and the gain on the sale of a building of   $13.9 million  . 
    
  Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes 
    
  Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes   increased     8%   due to increases in revenues and expenses discussed above and includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of   one   percentage point.  Overall margin   increased   from   18.9%   in fiscal   2015   to   19.2%   in fiscal   2016   due to the gain on the sale of the AMD business, the gain on the sale of the building and decreased selling expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal   2016   as compared to fiscal   2015  .  These increases were offset by an increase in interest expense related to our September 2015   $2.0 billion   senior note issuance, investments in implementation and operational resources to support our revenue growth, and the charges related to our workforce optimization effort.   
    
  Adjusted EBIT 
    
  Adjusted EBIT, which excludes certain interest amounts, the impact of the AMD business sale, the gain on the sale of a building and the charges related to our workforce optimization effort,   increase  d   10%   due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above.  Overall Adjusted EBIT margin   increase  d from   18.8%   in fiscal   2015   to   19.5%   in fiscal   2016   due to lower selling expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by investments in implementation and operational resources to support our revenue growth.  
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  The effective tax rate in fiscal   2016   and   2015   was   33.2%   and   33.5%  , respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the usage of foreign tax credits in a repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal   2016  , partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters in fiscal   2015  . 
    
  Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  The effective tax rate, adjusted for the impact of the workforce optimization effort, sale of the AMD business, and a gain on the sale of a building, for fiscal   2016   and   2015   was   33.3%   and   33.5%  , respectively.  The decrease in the Adjusted effective tax rate was due to the usage of foreign tax credits in a repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal   2016  , partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters during fiscal   2015  . 
    
  Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations 
    
  Net earnings from continuing operations   increased     8%   on higher earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a   lower   effective tax rate, as described above.

Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased   12%   to   $3.25   in fiscal   2016  , as compared to   $2.89   in fiscal   2015  .  Diluted EPS growth was unfavorably impacted   one percentage point   due to foreign currency translation in fiscal   2016  , as compared to fiscal   2015  . 
    
  In fiscal   2016  , our diluted EPS from continuing operations reflects the   increase   in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately   13.8 million   shares in fiscal   2016   and   18.2 million   shares in fiscal   2015  , partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans. 

Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations 
    
  Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased   9%   in fiscal   2016   due to the   increase   in revenues and expenses described above and the impact of the   lower   Adjusted effective tax rate when compared to fiscal   2015  . 
    
  For fiscal   2016  , our Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations reflects the   increase   in Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of   13.8 million   shares during fiscal   2016   and the repurchase of   18.2 million   shares in fiscal   2015  , offset by shares issued under our employee benefit plans.

  Total revenues in fiscal   2015   include interest on funds held for clients of   $377.7 million  , as compared to   $373.4 million   in fiscal   2014  .  The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from an increase in our average client funds balance of   5%   to   $21.8 billion   in fiscal   2015  , partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate earned to   1.7%   in fiscal   2015  , as compared to   1.8%   in fiscal   2014  .  Total interest on funds held for clients was impacted one percentage point from unfavorable foreign currency translation.

  Revenues 
    
  Employer Services' revenues, as reported,   increase  d   5%   in fiscal   2016  , as compared to fiscal   2015  , despite a negative impact of one percentage point from foreign currency translation.  Revenues   increase  d due to new business started from new business bookings, the impact of price increases, and an increase in the number of employees on our clients  payrolls as our U.S. pays per control increased   2.5%   in fiscal   2016   as compared to fiscal   2015  .  These increases were partially offset by the impact of client losses and foreign currency translation.  Our worldwide client revenue retention rate for fiscal   2016   decreased 100 basis points to 90.5% as compared to our rate for fiscal   2015   primarily due to elevated losses on our legacy platforms. 
    
  Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes 
    
  Employer Services  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported,   increase  d   6%   in fiscal   2016  , as compared to fiscal   2015  .  The   increase   was due to   increase  d revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by   an increase   in expenses of   $221.9 million  .  The   increase   in expenses is related to increased costs of servicing our clients, as well as increased selling and implementation expenses due to new business bookings and associated implementation costs, including an increase in costs related to assisting our clients with ACA compliance.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.   
    
  Employer Services' overall margin   increase  d from   30.5%   to   31.1%   for fiscal   2016  , as compared to fiscal   2015  .  This   increase   is due to lower selling expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal   2016   as compared to fiscal   2015   as well as an increase of   30   basis points from foreign currency translation, partially offset by investments in implementation and operational resources to support our revenue growth.

Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes 
    
  Employer Services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes   increase  d   7%   due to the   increase   in revenues from continuing operations of   $377.5 million   discussed above, partially offset by   an increase   in expenses of   $205.7 million  .  This growth includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of one percentage point.  Expenses increased in fiscal   2015  , as compared to fiscal   2014  , due to labor related costs to support our growing revenues and an increase in selling expenses as we experienced traction from our increased focus on product development, high demand for additional HCM solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the ACA, improved productivity, and an improving economic backdrop in the U.S.  Overall margin   increase  d approximately   60   basis points from   29.9%   to   30.5%   in fiscal   2015  , as compared to fiscal   2014  , due to our operating costs related to servicing our clients increasing at a slower rate than our revenues partially offset by an increase in selling expense due to higher new business bookings.  
    
  PEO Services 
    
  Fiscal   2016   Compared to Fiscal   2015    
    
  Revenues 
    
  PEO Services' revenues as reported   increased     16%   in fiscal   2016  , as compared to fiscal   2015  .  Such revenues include pass-through costs of   $2,336.3 million   for fiscal   2016   and   $2,015.9 million   for fiscal   2015   associated with benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.  The   increase   in revenues was due to a   13%   increase in the average number of worksite employees, driven by an increase in the number of new PEO Services clients and growth in our existing clients, as well as higher client participation and higher benefit pass-through costs in our PEO benefit offerings. 
    
  Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes 
    
  PEO Services  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes   increased     23%   in fiscal   2016  , as compared to fiscal   2015  .  The   increase   was due to   increase  d revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an   increase   in expenses of   $357.0 million  .  This   increase   in expenses is primarily related to   an increase   in pass-through costs of   $320.4 million   described above.  Overall margin   increase  d from   11.4%   to   12.1%   for fiscal   2016  , as compared to fiscal   2015  , due to operating efficiencies, as our operating costs related to servicing our clients increased slower than our revenues, and sales efficiencies. 
       
  Fiscal   2015   Compared to Fiscal   2014    
    
  Revenues 
    
  PEO Services' revenues   increase  d   17%   in fiscal   2015  , as compared to fiscal   2014  .  Such revenues include pass-through costs of   $2,015.9 million   for fiscal   2015   and   $1,736.0 million   for fiscal   2014   associated with benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.  The   increase   in revenues was due to a 14% increase in the average number of worksite employees, resulting from an increase in the number of new clients and growth in our existing clients.   
    
  Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes     
    
  PEO Services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes   increase  d   30%   in fiscal   2015  , as compared to fiscal   2014  .  The increase was due to increased revenues of   $376.3 million   discussed above, partially offset by an increase in expenses of   $307.1 million  .  This increase in expenses is primarily related to the increase in pass-through costs of   $279.9 million   described above.  Overall margin increased from   10.3%   to   11.4%   for fiscal   2015  , as compared to fiscal   2014  , due to sales productivity and increased operating efficiencies, as our costs related to acquiring new business and servicing our clients increased slower than our revenues.

Other 
    
  The primary components of the  Other  segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity, non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, the elimination of intercompany transactions, interest expense, certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense, and beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the historical results of the AMD business, which was previously reported in the Employer Services segment.  This change, which is adjusted for both the current period and the prior period in the table above, did not significantly affect reportable segment results and is consistent with the way the chief operating decision maker assesses the performance of the reportable segments.     
    
  ADP Indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence.  PEO Services has secured a workers  compensation and employer s liability insurance policy that has a $1 million per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG.  We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO Services business.  Premiums are charged by ADP Indemnity to PEO Services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the PEO Services' worksite employees.  Changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by ADP Indemnity.  For the fiscal years 2013 to 2017, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited ("Chubb"), to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity during these policy years.  Each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit.  We believe the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote.  During fiscal   2016  , ADP Indemnity paid a premium of   $202.0 million   to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal   2016   policy year up to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees.  ADP Indemnity paid a premium of   $221.0 million   in July 2016 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the year ended June 30, 2017 ("fiscal   2017  ") policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal   2016   reinsurance policy. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  For corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, long-term marketable securities, and cash flow from operations together with our   $9.25 billion   of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividend, share repurchases, and capital expenditures.  
    
  For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short-term reverse repurchase agreements together with our   $9.25 billion   of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  Please see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a further discussion of the risks of our client funds investment strategy.  See Note   7   of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.  
    
  As of   June 30, 2016  , cash and short-term marketable securities were $  3,214.6 million  , which were primarily invested in time deposits, money market funds and asset-backed commercial paper. 
    
  Operating, Investing and Financing Cash Flows 
    
  Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for the years ended   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , are summarized as follows:  
  
   31 

Fiscal   2016   Compared to Fiscal   2015    
    
  Net cash flows   provided by   operating activities   decrease  d due to   $226.7 million   received from the sale of notes receivable related to Dealer Services financing arrangements during fiscal 2015.  
    
  Net cash flows used in investing activities increased due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of   $5,257.6 million   and the receipt of the CDK Global, Inc.("CDK") dividend during fiscal   2015  , partially offset by the timing of purchases of and proceeds from corporate and client funds marketable securities of $545.7 million. 
    
  Net cash flows provided by financing activities increased due to the net increase in client funds obligations of   $2,728.9 million  , as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, proceeds from our   $2.0 billion   September 2015 debt issuance, a decrease in our repurchases of common stock, and the timing of borrowings and repayments of commercial paper. We purchased approximately   13.8 million   shares of our common stock at an average price per share of   $82.88   during fiscal   2016   as compared to purchases of   18.2 million   shares at an average price per share of   $85.28   during fiscal   2015  .  From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.  
    
  Fiscal   2015   Compared to Fiscal   2014    
    
  Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to $226.7 million received from the sale of notes receivable related to Dealer Services financing arrangements and a lower pension contribution of $74.8 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.  
    
  Net cash flows of investing activities changed due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $5,498.4 million, partially offset by the receipt of the CDK dividend during fiscal 2015. 
    
  Net cash flows of financing activities changed due to the net increase in client funds obligations of $9,063.9 million, as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, partially offset by an increase in our repurchases of common stock and the timing of borrowings and repayments of commercial paper.  
    
  Capital Resources and Client Fund Obligations 
    
  In September 2015, we issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025.  We may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure.  However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  See Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term financing including this fiscal 2016 debt issuance. 
    
  Our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  During the majority of fiscal   2016  , this commercial paper program provided for the issuance of up to   $8.25 billion   in aggregate maturity value and in June 2016, we increased our commercial paper program to  
  
   32 

$9.25 billion  .  Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor s and Prime-1 by Moody s.  These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities.  Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days.  For fiscal   2016  , our average daily borrowings were   $2.7 billion   at a weighted average interest rate of   0.3%  .  The weighted average maturity of the Company s commercial paper during fiscal   2016   was approximately   two days  .  At   June 30, 2016   and 2015, we had   no   outstanding obligations under our short-term commercial paper program.  
    
  Our U.S. and Canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days.  We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  At   June 30, 2016   and 2015, there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements.  For fiscal   2016   and   2015  , we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of   $341.0 million   and   $421.2 million  , respectively, at weighted average interest rates of   0.4%  .  See Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for client fund investments used as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements.  
    
  We vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility.  We have a   $3.25 billion  , 364-day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in   June 2017   with a one year term-out option.  In addition, we have a five-year   $2.25 billion   credit facility and a five-year   $3.75 billion   credit facility maturing in   June 2020   and   June 2021  , respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $  500 million  , subject to the availability of additional commitments.  The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.  We had no borrowings through   June 30, 2016   under the credit agreements. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the   $9.25 billion   available to us under the revolving credit agreements.  See Note   7   of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities. 
    
  Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities.  We own AAA rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, auto loan, equipment lease, rate reduction, and other asset-backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral.  All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected.  In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Farm Credit Banks.  We do own mortgage-backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages.  These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15-year and 30-year residential mortgages and are guaranteed primarily by Federal National Mortgage Association as to the timely payment of principal and interest.  Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.  See Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients. 
    
  Capital expenditures for continuing operations for fiscal   2016   were   $165.7 million  , as compared to   $171.2 million   for fiscal   2015  . We expect capital expenditures in fiscal   2017   to be about $250 million.  

33 

Contractual Obligations 
    
       The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations with a future life of greater than one year at   June 30, 2016  . 

(1) 
    These amounts represent the principal and interest payments of our debt.   
       
           (2) 
    Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements.  We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software.  The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time.  Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices.  Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.   
       
           (3) 
    Purchase obligations are comprised of a   $221.0 million   reinsurance premium with Chubb for the fiscal   2017   policy year, as well as obligations related to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets.  
       
           (4) 
    We are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid. 
       
           (5) 
    Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements.  These amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be   $11.0 million   in fiscal   2017  .  
       
  In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services.  As of   June 30, 2016  , the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal   2017  , total   $33,331.8 million   and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We had   $33,841.2 million   of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   June 30, 2016  . 
    
  Separately, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of   $221.0 million   in July   2016   to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal   2017   policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal   2016   reinsurance policy.  At   June 30, 2016  , ADP Indemnity had total assets of   $456.2 million   to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of   $416.5 million   for the policy years since July 1, 2003.  ADP Indemnity paid claims of   $8.3 million   and   $26.0 million  , net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Refer to the "Analysis of Reportable Segments - Other" above for additional information regarding ADP Indemnity.   
    
  In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.   
    
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees). 
  
   34 

Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes.  All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities. 
    
  Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.   
       
  We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client s obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client s obligation.  As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations. 
    
  There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets.  Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations.  However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations.  We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our   $9.25 billion   commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor s and Prime-1 ("P-1") by Moody s, the highest possible credit ratings), ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreements and available borrowings under our   $9.25 billion   committed credit facilities.  The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business.  In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below. 
    
  We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments.  The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A.  The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years.  Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1.  Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf. 

35 

Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: 

We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested.  Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments.  This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes.  The annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio declined to   1.6%   for fiscal   2016  , as compared to   1.7%   for fiscal   2015  .  A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $13 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending   June 30, 2017  .  A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $7 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending   June 30, 2017  . 
    
  We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moody s, Standard   Poor s, and for Canadian securities, DBRS. Approximately   80%   of our available-for-sale securities held a AAA or AA rating at   June 30, 2016  .  In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. and Canadian government or government agency securities. 
    
  We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  We experienced pressure from foreign currency translation on our revenue and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in fiscal 2015 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.  We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.  We had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at   June 30, 2016   or   2015  .

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  See Note 1, New Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 
    
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. 
    
    Revenue Recognition.     Our     revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (  e.g.,   Employer Services' payroll processing fees), investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services' client-related funds, and fees charged to implement clients on the Company's solutions.  We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (  e.g.,   number of payees or number of payrolls processed).  Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. 
    
  PEO provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution, including offering benefits, providing workers  compensation insurance, and administering state unemployment insurance, among other human resources functions.  Amounts collected from PEO worksite employers include payroll, fees for benefits, and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes, fees for workers  compensation and state unemployment taxes. 
    
  The payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers is presented in revenue net, as the Company is not the primary obligor with respect to this aspect of the PEO arrangement.  With respect to the payroll and payroll taxes, the worksite employer is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, and determines the service specifications. 
    
  The fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits, workers  compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits, workers  compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses, as the Company acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement.  With respect to the fees for benefits, workers  compensation and state unemployment taxes, the Company is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, determines the service specifications and is liable for credit risk. 
       
  We recognize interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. 
    
  Client implementation fees are charged to set clients up on our solutions and are deferred until the client has gone live and services have begun.  These fees are amortized to revenue over the longer of the contractual term or expected client life, including estimated renewals of client contracts.    
       
  We assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.   
    
  Goodwill  .  We account for goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other," which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit s goodwill for impairment or can directly perform the two-step impairment test.  Based on a qualitative assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 would be performed.  
    
  Our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of   June 30, 2016   was performed using a qualitative approach.  The qualitative assessment considered industry and market considerations for any deterioration in the environment in which we operate, the competitive environment, a decline (both absolute and relative to peers) in market-dependent multiples or metrics, any changes in the market for our services, and regulatory and political development.  Additionally, we assessed financial  
  
   37 

performance by reporting unit and considered cost factors, such as labor or other costs, that would have a negative effect on results.  The annual goodwill impairment assessments performed for fiscal   2016   have indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is substantially in excess of carrying value and not at risk of failing step one of the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  Based on our qualitative assessment, the Company has determined that goodwill is not impaired. 
    
  Income Taxes.    The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns.  Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (  e.g.  , realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).  In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other tax authorities.  A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Specifically, the likelihood of an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be  more likely than not   assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements.  If a tax position drops below the  more likely than not  standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized.  Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the  more likely than not  standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes.  A change in the assessment of the  more likely than not  standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  As of   June 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were   $27.4 million   and   $27.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions.  Based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to   $2 million   in the next twelve months.  Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. 
    
    Stock-Based Compensation  . We measure stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model.  The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price, and other factors.  Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data.  The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.  Determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and, therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options.

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
    
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
  Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  
  Roseland, New Jersey  
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of consolidated earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2016.  Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2.  These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, the consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 5, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTE   1  . SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  A. Basis of Preparation.    The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( ADP  or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses, and accumulated other comprehensive income that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto.  Actual results may differ from those estimates.  The Consolidated Financial Statements and all relevant footnotes have been adjusted for all businesses that qualify as a discontinued operation (see Note   2  ).  The Financial Data by Segment and Geographic Area (Note 13) has also been adjusted to reflect the historical results of AdvancedMD ("AMD") within the Other segment. 
    
  B. Description of Business.    The Company is a provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management ("HCM") solutions. The Company classifies its operations into the following two reportable segments: Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization ( PEO ) Services.  The primary components of the  Other  segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity, non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, the elimination of intercompany transactions, interest expense, certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense, and beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the historical results of the AMD business, which was previously reported in the Employer Services segment.  This change did not significantly affect reportable segment results and is consistent with the way the chief operating decision maker assesses the performance of the reportable segments.  Prior to October 1, 2014, the Company had a third reportable segment, Dealer Services.  Refer to Note 2 for further information. 
    
  C. Revenue Recognition.    Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (  e.g.,   Employer Services' payroll processing fees), investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds, other Employer Services' client-related funds, and fees charged to implement clients on the Company's solutions.  The Company enters into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (  e.g.,   number of payees or number of payrolls processed).  Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. 
    
  PEO provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution, including offering benefits, providing workers  compensation insurance, and administering state unemployment insurance, among other human resources functions.  Amounts collected from PEO worksite employers include payroll, fees for benefits, and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes, fees for workers  compensation and state unemployment taxes. 
    
  The payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers is presented in revenue net, as the Company is not the primary obligor with respect to this aspect of the PEO arrangement.  With respect to the payroll and payroll taxes, the worksite employer is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, and determines the service specifications. 
    
  The fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits, workers  compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits, workers  compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses, as the Company acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement.  With respect to the fees for benefits, workers  compensation and state unemployment taxes, the Company is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, determines the service specifications and is liable for credit risk. 
    
  Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. 
    
  Client implementation fees are charged to set clients up on the Company's platform and are deferred until the client has gone live on the Company's solutions and services have begun.  These fees are amortized to revenue over the longer of the contractual term or the expected client life, including estimated renewals of client contracts.  Additionally, certain  
  
   45 

implementation costs are deferred until the client has gone live on the Company's solution and services have begun and are then amortized over the longer of the contractual term or the expected client life, including estimated renewals of client contracts.   
    
  The Company assesses the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.   
    
  D. Cash and Cash Equivalents.    Investment securities with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents.  The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value. 
    
  E. Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients.    All of the Company's marketable securities are considered to be  available-for-sale  and, accordingly, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until realized.  Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined on a specific-identification basis and are included in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. 
    
  If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the Company assesses whether it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery.  If either of those two conditions is met, the Company would recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value.  If the Company does not intend to sell a security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.   
    
  Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale security as an adjustment to yield using the effective-interest method.  Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.  
  F. Fair Value Measurements.    Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is based upon the Company s principal, or most advantageous, market for a specific asset or liability. 
    
  U.S. GAAP provides for a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows: 
    
  Level 1  Fair value is determined based upon quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities that are traded in active markets. 
    
  Level 2  Fair value is determined based upon inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, including: 
    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 
    quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; 
    inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or 
    inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
    
  Level 3  Fair value is determined based upon inputs that are unobservable and reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based upon the best information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows). 
    
  The Company's corporate investments and funds held for clients (see Note 4) and its long term debt are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as described below.  Over   99%   of the Company's available-for-sale securities included in Level 2 are valued based on prices obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of the Company's Level 2 investments, the independent pricing service uses various pricing models for each asset class that are consistent with what other market participants would use, including the market approach.  Inputs and assumptions to the pricing model of the independent pricing service are derived from market observable sources including:  benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other market-related data. Since many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the independent pricing service applies available information, as applicable, through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare valuations.  For the purposes of valuing the Company s asset-backed securities, as well as the mortgage-backed securities that are included within Other securities in Note 4, the independent pricing service includes additional inputs to the model such as monthly payment  
  
   46 

information, new issue data, and collateral performance.  For the purposes of valuing the Company s Municipal bonds, the independent pricing service includes Municipal Market Data benchmark yield curves as additional inputs to the model.  While the Company is not provided access to the proprietary models of the third party pricing service, each quarterly reporting period, the Company reviews the inputs utilized by the independent pricing service and compares the valuations received from the independent pricing service to valuations from at least one other observable source for reasonableness. The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service and the Company believes the prices received from the independent pricing service are representative of the prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (exit price). The Company has no available-for-sale securities included in Level 1 and Level 3. 
    
  In   September 2015  , the Company issued fixed-rate notes with   5  -year and   10  -year maturities for an aggregate principal amount of   $2.0 billion   (collectively the "Notes").  The  Notes are valued utilizing a variety of inputs obtained from an independent pricing service, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.  The Company reviews the values generated by the independent pricing service for reasonableness by comparing the valuations received from the independent pricing service to valuations from at least one other observable source.  The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service.  
    
  The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.  In certain instances, the inputs used to measure fair value may meet the definition of more than one level of the fair value hierarchy.  The significant input with the lowest level priority is used to determine the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  G. Long-term Receivables.    Long-term receivables primarily relate to implementation and transition costs charged to clients acquiring ADP s products and services.  Unearned income from finance receivables represents the excess of gross receivables over the amount financed. Unearned income is amortized using the effective-interest method to maintain a constant rate of return over the term of each contract.  
    
  Notes receivable aged over   30   days past due are considered delinquent and notes receivable aged over   60   days past due with known collection issues are placed on non-accrual status. Interest revenue is not recognized on notes receivable while on non-accrual status.  Cash payments received on non-accrual receivables are applied towards the principal.  When notes receivable on non-accrual status are again less than   60   days past due, recognition of interest revenue for notes receivable is resumed.  
    
  The allowance for doubtful accounts on long-term receivables is the Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses related to the Company's existing note receivables. 
  H. Property, Plant and Equipment.    Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.  The estimated useful lives of assets are primarily as follows: 
                 Data processing equipment 
    2 to 5 years 
      Buildings 
    20 to 40 years 
      Furniture and fixtures 
    4 to 7 years 

The Company has obligations under various facilities, equipment leases, and software license agreements.  The Company assesses whether these arrangements meet the criteria for capital leases by determining whether the agreement transfers ownership of the asset, whether the lease includes a bargain purchase option, whether the lease term is for greater than   75%   of the asset's useful life, or whether the minimum lease payments exceed   90%   of the leased equipment's fair market value.  All of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases.   Total expense under these operating lease agreements was approximately   $271.3 million  ,   $237.9 million  , and   $227.4 million   in fiscal   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively. 
    
  I. Goodwill.    The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with  Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other," which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  According to ASC 350, the Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit s goodwill for impairment or can directly perform the two-step impairment test. Based on a qualitative assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 would be performed.  
  
   47 

The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment as of   June 30, 2016   was performed using a qualitative approach.  The qualitative assessment considered industry and market considerations for any deterioration in the environment in which the Company operates, the competitive environment, a decline (both absolute and relative to peers) in market-dependent multiples or metrics, any changes in the market for the Company's products and services, and regulatory and political developments. Additionally, the Company assessed financial performance by reporting unit and considered cost factors, such as labor or other costs, that would have a negative effect on results.  Based on the qualitative assessment, the Company has determined that goodwill is not impaired. 
    
  J. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.    Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.  
  K. Foreign Currency.    The net assets of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect for each period, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in the periods.  Gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Currency transaction gains or losses, which are included in the results of operations, are not significant for all periods presented.  
    
  L. Foreign Currency Risk Management Programs and Derivative Financial Instruments.    The Company transacts business in various foreign jurisdictions and is therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.  The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.   
    
  M. Earnings per Share ( EPS ).    The Company computes EPS in accordance with ASC 260.  
    
  The calculations of basic and diluted EPS are as follows: 

Options to purchase   1.8 million  ,   0.4 million  , and   1.5 million   shares of common stock for fiscal   2016  , fiscal   2015  , and fiscal   2014  , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  

48 

N. Stock-Based Compensation.    The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant, and in the case of international units settled in cash, adjusts this fair value based on changes in the Company's stock price during the vesting period.  The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued using a binomial option-pricing model.  The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior.  Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Company's stock price, and other factors.  Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes.  The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data.  The expected life of a stock option grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.  Restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are valued based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant and, in the case of performance based restricted stock units and restricted stock, are adjusted for changes to probabilities of achieving performance targets.  International restricted stock units are settled in cash and are marked-to-market based on changes in the Company's stock price.  Refer to Note   9   for additional information on the Company's stock-based compensation programs. 
    
  O. Internal Use Software.    Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a   three   to   five  -year period on a straight-line basis.  The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software.  In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects.  The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects.  Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.  The Company also expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements, as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities. 
    
  P. Acquisitions.    Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by the Company are included in the Statements of Consolidated Earnings since their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the excess purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when the Company receives final information, including appraisals and other analysis. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and circumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months.  The Company did not acquire any businesses during fiscal   2016   or fiscal   2014  .  The Company acquired   one   business during fiscal   2015   for approximately   $10.1 million  , net of cash acquired.  The acquisition was not material to the Company's operations, financial position, or cash flows.  Purchase accounting has been finalized for all acquisitions completed to date. 
    
  Q. Income Taxes.    The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns.  The Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.   
    
  There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Specifically, the likelihood of  an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be  more likely than not,  assuming that these positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements.  If a tax position drops below the  more likely than not  standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized.  Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the  more likely than not  standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes.  As of   June 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were   $27.4 million   and   $27.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions.  Based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings by up to   $2 million  .  Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability, and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. 

49 

R. Workers' Compensation Costs.    The Company employs a third-party actuary to assist in determining the estimated claim liability related to workers' compensation and employer's liability coverage for PEO Services worksite employees.  In estimating ultimate loss rates, we utilize historical loss experience, exposure data, and actuarial judgment, together with a range of inputs which are primarily based upon the worksite employee's job responsibilities, their location, the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends.  For each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers' compensation claims cost estimates.  PEO Services has secured a workers  compensation and employer s liability insurance policy that has a $1 million per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG.  For the fiscal years 2013 to 2016, as well as in July 2016 for the year ended June 30, 2017 ("fiscal 2017") policy year, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited ("Chubb"), to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity during these policy years.  Each of these reinsurance arrangements limit our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit.  The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote.  
    
  S. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.   
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  In fiscal 2016, the Company prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes."  The update simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets, including valuation allowances, be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.  ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated statement of financial condition and had no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows.  Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. 
    
  In fiscal 2016, the Company prospectively adopted ASU 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments."  The update eliminates the need to retrospectively adjust prior period information in the financial statements for acquisition adjustments to goodwill during the measurement period.  The adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows as presented, however, the future impact of ASU 2015-16 will be dependent on future acquisitions, if any. 
    
  In fiscal 2016, the Company retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs."  Debt issuance costs have been presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.  ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
    
  In fiscal 2016, the Company prospectively adopted ASU 2014-08, "Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity."  ASU 2014-08 requires that a disposal representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s financial results or a business activity classified as held for sale should be reported as a discontinued operation.  Per the criteria of ASU 2014-08, the Company did not classify the sale of AMD as a discontinued operation.  The businesses classified as a discontinued operation prior to June 30, 2015 continue to be classified as a discontinued operation (see Note   3  ). 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  ASU 2016-13 requires that credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct write-down to the security.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
    
  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09 "Compensation - Stock Compensation - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)." Under this standard, among other changes, income tax benefits and deficiencies with respect to stock-based compensation will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows and stock-based compensation awards can qualify as equity awards even if the entity permits tax withholdings greater than the statutory minimum. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that  
  
   50 

reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2016-09 is expected to impact the Company's provision for income taxes on its Statements of Consolidated Earnings and its operating and financing cash flows on its Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The magnitude of such impacts are dependent upon the Company's future grants of stock-based compensation, the Company's stock price in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date, and the exercise behavior of the Company's equity compensation holders. 
    
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02 "Leases (Topic 842)."  This update amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, and requires lessees to recognize most lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements.  ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application.  ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.  
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, "Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement."  The update provides guidance on whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.  ASU 2015-05 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company intends to prospectively adopt ASU 2015-05 on July 1, 2016.  ASU 2015-05 is expected to change the geography of certain software licenses on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings (from operating expenses to depreciation and amortization) and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow (from operating cash flows to investing cash flows), as well as result in additional intangible assets on the Consolidate Balance Sheet.  The magnitude of these changes is dependent upon new or materially modified software licenses entered into after July 1, 2016. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-04, "Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer's Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets."  The update allows an entity to remeasure their pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assets and liabilities at the month-end closest to a significant event such as a plan amendment, curtailment, or settlement.  ASU 2015-04 is to be applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  Early adoption is permitted.  The impact of ASU 2015-04 is dependent upon the nature of future significant events impacting the Company's pension plans, if any.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, and has since issued additional amendments to ASU 2014-09.  These new standards require an entity to recognize revenue depicting the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standards will also result in enhanced revenue related disclosures.  Entities have the option to apply the new guidance under a retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application within the Statements of Consolidated Financial Position.  The new standards are effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has not yet determined the impact of these new revenue recognition standards on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

NOTE   2  . DIVESTITURES  
    
  A. Disposition 
    
  On   September 1, 2015  , the Company completed the sale of its AMD business for a pre-tax gain of   $29.1 million  , less costs to sell, and recorded such gain within Other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. The Company determined that the disposition did not meet the criteria for reporting discontinued operations under ASU 2014-08, which was adopted prospectively on July 1, 2015, as the disposition of this business does not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company's operations or financial results.  The historical results of AMD are being reported in the Other segment (see Note   13  ).  
    
  B. Discontinued Operations 
    
  On   June 26, 2015  , the Company completed the sale of its Procure-to-Pay business ("P2P") for a pre-tax gain of   $100.9 million  , less costs to sell, and recorded such gain within earnings from discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.  
    
  On   September 30, 2014  , the Company completed the tax free spin-off of its former Dealer Services business, which was a separate reportable segment, into an independent publicly traded company called CDK Global, Inc. ("CDK").  As a result of the spin-off, ADP stockholders of record on   September 24, 2014   (the "record date") received   one   share of CDK common stock on September 30, 2014, par value   $0.01   per share, for every   three   shares of ADP common stock held by them on the record date and cash for any fractional shares of CDK common stock.  ADP distributed approximately   160.6 million   shares of CDK common stock in the distribution.  During the first quarter of fiscal   2016  , the Company became aware that   1.0 million   of the   160.6 million   shares of CDK stock distributed at the distribution date were inadvertently issued and distributed with respect to certain unvested Company equity awards.   The   1.0 million   shares were canceled during the first quarter of fiscal   2016  .  Such shares distributed as part of the spin-off did not have any impact to previously reported results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.  The spin-off was made without the payment of any consideration or the exchange of any shares by ADP stockholders.  The spin-off, transitional, and on-going relationships between ADP and CDK are governed by the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into between ADP and CDK and certain other ancillary agreements. 
    
  Incremental costs associated with the spin-off of CDK and divestiture of P2P of   $50.1 million   for fiscal   2015   are included in discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. 
    
  On   February 28, 2014  , the Company completed the sale of its Occupational Health and Safety services business ("OHS") for a pre-tax gain of   $15.6 million  , less costs to sell, and recorded such gain within earnings from discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.  In connection with the disposal of OHS, the Company classified the results of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  OHS was previously reported in the Employer Services segment. 
    
  Results for discontinued operations were as follows: 

52 

NOTE   3  . OTHER INCOME, NET 
    
  Other income, net consists of the following: 

During fiscal   2016  , the Company sold a building and, as a result, recorded a gain of   $13.9 million   in Other income, net, on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. 
    
  During fiscal   2015  , the Company sold notes receivable related to Dealer Services financing arrangements for   $226.7 million  .  Although the sale of the notes receivable transfers the majority of the risk to the purchaser, the Company does retain a minimal level of credit risk on the sold receivables.  The cash received in exchange for the notes receivable sold was recorded within the operating activities on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows and the gain on sale of   $1.4 million   was recorded within Other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. 

NOTE   4  . CORPORATE INVESTMENTS AND FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS 
    
  Corporate investments and funds held for clients at   June 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

(A) Included within available-for-sale securities are corporate investments with fair values of   $31.3 million   and funds held for clients with fair values of   $21,573.7 million  .  All available-for-sale securities were included in Level 2.  
  
   53 

(B) Included within available-for-sale securities are corporate investments with fair values of   $55.5 million   and funds held for clients with fair values of   $20,818.3 million  .  All available-for-sale securities were included in Level 2.  
     
  For a description of the fair value hierarchy and the Company's fair value methodologies, including the use of an independent third-party pricing service, see Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."  The Company did not transfer any assets between Levels during fiscal   2016   or   2015  .  In addition, the Company did not adjust the prices obtained from the independent pricing service.  The Company has no available-for-sale securities included in Level 1 or Level 3 as of   June 30, 2016  .  
    
  The unrealized losses and fair values of available-for-sale securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for a period of less than and greater than 12 months as of   June 30, 2016  , are as follows:  

54 

The unrealized losses and fair values of available-for-sale securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for a period of less than and greater than 12 months as of   June 30, 2015   are as follows:  

At   June 30, 2016  , Corporate bonds include investment-grade debt securities, which include a wide variety of issuers, industries, and sectors, primarily carry credit ratings of A and above, and have maturities ranging from   July 2016   to   April 2024  .     
    
  At   June 30, 2016  , U.S. government agency securities primarily include debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Farm Credit Banks with fair values of   $3,220.0 million   and   $976.2 million  , respectively.  U.S. government agency securities represent senior, unsecured, non-callable debt that primarily carry ratings of Aaa by Moody's and AA+ by Standard   Poor's with maturities ranging from   July 2016   through   May 2024  .  
    
  At   June 30, 2016  , asset-backed securities include AAA rated senior tranches of securities with predominately prime collateral of fixed-rate credit card, auto loan, equipment lease and rate reduction receivables with fair values of   $2,172.3 million  ,   $1,054.8 million  ,   $338.2 million  , and   $255.2 million   respectively.  These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of the underlying pools of receivables.  The primary risk associated with these securities is the collection risk of the underlying receivables.  All collateral on such asset-backed securities has performed as expected through   June 30, 2016  . 
    
  At   June 30, 2016  , other securities and their fair value primarily represent: AAA and AA rated supranational bonds of   $189.8 million  , AAA and AA rated sovereign bonds of   $188.9 million  , and AA rated mortgage-backed securities of   $99.0 million   that are guaranteed primarily by Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae").  The Company's mortgage-backed securities represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages.  These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of   15  -year and   30  -year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae as to the timely payment of principal and interest.   
    
  Classification of corporate investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows: 

Funds held for clients represent assets that, based upon the Company's intent, are restricted for use solely for the purposes of satisfying the obligations to remit funds relating to the Company s payroll and payroll tax filing services, which are classified as client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

55 

Funds held for clients have been invested in the following categories: 

Client funds obligations represent the Company's contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy clients' payroll and tax payment obligations and are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time that the Company impounds funds from clients.  The client funds obligations represent liabilities that will be repaid within   one year   of the balance sheet date.  The Company has reported client funds obligations as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets totaling   $33,331.8 million   and   $24,650.5 million   as of   June 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The Company has classified funds held for clients as a current asset since these funds are held solely for the purposes of satisfying the client funds obligations.  The Company has reported the cash flows related to the purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities and related to the proceeds from the sales and maturities of corporate and client funds marketable securities on a gross basis in the investing section of the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.  The Company has reported the cash inflows and outflows related to client funds investments with original maturities of   ninety days or less   on a net basis within net increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents and other restricted assets held to satisfy client funds obligations in the investing section of the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.  The Company has reported the cash flows related to the cash received from and paid on behalf of clients on a net basis within net increase in client funds obligations in the financing section of the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. 
    
  Approximately   80%   of the available-for-sale securities held a AAA or AA rating at   June 30, 2016  , as rated by Moody's, Standard   Poor's and, for Canadian securities, DBRS.  All available-for-sale securities were rated as investment grade at   June 30, 2016  . 
    
  Expected maturities of available-for-sale securities at   June 30, 2016   are as follows: 

NOTE   5  .  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT    
    
  Property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation at June 30,   2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment was   $135.6 million  ,   $127.2 million  , and   $124.1 million   for fiscal   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively. 

56 

NOTE   6  . GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET 
    
  Changes in goodwill for the fiscal years ended   June 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:   

(A) The goodwill balance at   June 30, 2015   and   2014   is net of accumulated impairment losses of   $42.7 million   related to the Employer Services segment. 
    
  Components of intangible assets, net, are as follows: 

Other intangibles consist primarily of purchased rights, covenants, patents, and trademarks (acquired directly or through acquisitions).  All of the intangible assets have finite lives and, as such, are subject to amortization.  The weighted average remaining useful life of the intangible assets is   5 years   (  4 years   for software and software licenses,   9 years   for customer contracts and lists, and   2 years   for other intangibles).  Amortization of intangible assets was   $153.0 million  ,   $150.7 million  , and   $142.5 million   for fiscal   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively. 
    
  Estimated future amortization expenses of the Company's existing intangible assets are as follows: 

57 

NOTE   7  . SHORT TERM FINANCING 
    
  The Company has a   $3.25 billion  ,   364  -day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures   June 2017  .  The Company also has a   $2.25 billion     five  -year credit facility that matures in   June 2020   that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by   $500 million  , subject to the availability of additional commitments.  In addition, the Company has a   five  -year   $3.75 billion   credit facility maturing in   June 2021   that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by   $500 million  , subject to the availability of additional commitments.  The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the effective federal funds rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing.  The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements.  The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.  The Company had   no   borrowings through   June 30, 2016   under the credit agreements. 
    
  Our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short-term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  During the majority of fiscal   2016  , this commercial paper program provided for the issuance of up to   $8.25 billion   in aggregate maturity value; in June   2016  , we increased our U.S. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to   $9.25 billion   in aggregate maturity value.  The Company s commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard   Poor s and Prime-1 by Moody s.  These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities.  Maturities of commercial paper can range from   overnight to up to 364 days  .  At   June 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company had   no   commercial paper outstanding. In fiscal   2016   and   2015  , the Company's average daily borrowings were   $2.7 billion   and   $2.3 billion  , respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of   0.3%   and   0.1%  , respectively.  The weighted average maturity of the Company s commercial paper in fiscal   2016   and   2015   was approximately    two days  .     
    
  The Company s U.S. and Canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  These agreements generally have terms ranging from   overnight to up to five business days  .  At   June 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements.  In fiscal   2016   and   2015  , the Company had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of   $341.0 million   and   $421.2 million  , respectively, at weighted average interest rates of   0.4%  .  

NOTE   8  . LONG TERM DEBT 
    
  In   September 2015  , the Company issued fixed-rate notes with   5  -year and   10  -year maturities for an aggregate principal amount of   $2.0 billion  .  The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, semi-annually. 
    
  The principal amounts and associated effective interest rates of the Notes and other debt as of   June 30, 2016  , are as follows.  Debt outstanding at the comparative period of June 30, 2015 was not significant. 

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes and amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs.  
  As of   June 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Notes, based on level 2 inputs, was   $2,126.4 million  .  For a description of the fair value hierarchy and the Company's fair value methodologies, including the use of an independent third-party pricing service, see Note   1   "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."  

NOTE   9  . EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
    
  A.  Stock-based Compensation Plans.    Stock-based compensation consists of the following: 

Stock Options.    Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the dates of grant.  Stock options are issued under a graded vesting schedule and have a term of   10 years  .  Options granted after July 1, 2008 generally vest ratably over   four years  .  Compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the stock option on the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the stock option award.  Stock options are forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.  

Restricted Stock. 
                
    Time-Based Restricted Stock and Time-Based Restricted Stock Units.    Time-based restricted stock and time-based restricted stock units granted prior to fiscal 2013 are subject to vesting periods of up to   five years   and awards granted in fiscal 2013 and later are generally subject to a vesting period of   two years  .  Awards are forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.  
       
  Time-based restricted stock cannot be transferred during the vesting period.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of time-based restricted stock is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Dividends are paid on shares awarded under the time-based restricted stock program.   
    
  Time-based restricted stock units are settled in cash and cannot be transferred during the vesting period.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of time-based restricted stock units is recorded over the vesting period and is initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting date during the vesting period based on the change in ADP stock price.  No dividend equivalents are paid on units awarded under the time-based restricted stock unit program.  

Performance-Based Restricted Stock and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units.    Performance-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units generally vest over a   one   to   three   year performance period and a subsequent service period of up to   26 months  .  Under these programs, the Company communicates "target awards" at the beginning of the performance period with possible payouts at the end of the performance period ranging from   0%   to   150%   of the "target awards."  Awards are generally forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.   
       
  Performance-based restricted stock cannot be transferred during the vesting period.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock is recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date with subsequent adjustments to the number of shares awarded during the performance period based on probable and actual performance against targets.  After the performance period, if the performance targets are achieved, employees are eligible to receive dividends during the remaining vesting period on shares awarded under the performance-based restricted stock program. 
  Performance-based restricted stock units are settled in either cash or stock, depending on the employee's home country, and cannot be transferred during the vesting period.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in cash is recognized over the vesting period initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date with subsequent adjustments to the number of units awarded during the performance period based on probable and actual performance against targets.  In addition, compensation expense is remeasured at each reporting period during the vesting period based on the change in ADP stock price.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in stock is recorded over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date with subsequent adjustments to the number of units awarded based on the probable and actual performance against targets.  Dividend equivalents are paid on awards settled in stock under the performance-based restricted stock unit program.   
  
   58 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.    The Company offers an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to   95%   of the market value for the Company's common stock on the last day of the offering period.  This plan has been deemed non-compensatory and, therefore, no compensation expense has been recorded. 
       
  The Company currently utilizes treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Company's employee stock purchase plan, and restricted stock awards.  From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  The Company repurchased   13.8 million   shares in fiscal   2016   as compared to   18.2 million   shares repurchased in fiscal   2015  .  The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.  Cash payments related to the settlement of vested time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units were approximately   $25.2 million  ,   $25.2 million  , and   $1.2 million   during fiscal years   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively. 
    
  The following table represents stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits in each of fiscal   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively: 

Stock-based compensation expense attributable to employees of the discontinued operations are included in discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings and therefore not presented in the table above.  For fiscal   2015   and   2014  , such stock-based compensation expense was   $5.5 million   and   $21.2 million  , respectively. 
    
  As a result of the spin-off of CDK, the number of vested and unvested ADP stock options, their strike price, and the number of unvested performance-based and time-based restricted shares and units were adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value of the awards immediately prior to the spin-off using an adjustment ratio based on the market close price of ADP stock prior to the spin-off and the market open price of ADP stock subsequent to the spin-off.  Since these adjustments were considered to be a modification of the awards in accordance to ASC 718, "Stock Compensation," the Company compared the fair value of the awards immediately prior to the spin-off to the fair value immediately after the spin-off to measure potential incremental stock-based compensation expense, if any.  The adjustments did not result in an increase in the fair value of the awards and, accordingly, the Company did not record incremental stock-based compensation expense.  Unvested ADP stock options, unvested restricted stock, and unvested restricted stock units held by CDK employees were replaced by CDK awards immediately following the spin-off.  The stock-based compensation expense associated with the original grant of ADP awards to remaining ADP employees will continue to be recognized within earnings from continuing operations in the Company's Statements of Consolidated Earnings.  
    
  As of   June 30, 2016  , the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards amounted to   $12.2 million  ,   $28.0 million  , and   $67.7 million  , respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods of   1.7 years  ,   1.2 years  , and   1.3 years  , respectively. 

59 

In fiscal   2016  , the following activity occurred under the Company s existing plans. 
    
  Stock Options: 

Time-Based Restricted Stock and Time-Based Restricted Stock Units: 

Performance-Based Restricted Stock and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units: 

The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding stock options and exercisable stock options as of   June 30, 2016   was   $130.1 million   and   $83.8 million  , respectively, which have a remaining life of   7 years   and   6 years  , respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options exercised in fiscal   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014   was   $85.4 million  ,   $125.3 million  , and   $156.3 million  , respectively.   
    
  The fair value for stock options granted was estimated at the date of grant using the following assumptions: 

The weighted average fair values of shares granted were as follows: 
  
   60 

(A) The weighted average fair values of grants before September 30, 2014 were adjusted to reflect the impact of the spin-off of CDK. 
    
  B.  Pension Plans 
    
  The Company has a defined benefit cash balance pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees, under which employees are credited with a percentage of base pay plus interest.  The plan interest credit rate varies from year-to-year based on the   ten-year U.S. Treasury rate  .  Employees are fully vested upon completion of   three years   of service. The Company's policy is to make contributions within the range determined by generally accepted actuarial principles.  Effective January 1, 2015, associates hired on or after this date are not eligible to participate in the Company's U.S. pension plan.  In addition, associates rehired on or after January 1, 2015 will no longer be eligible to earn additional contributions but will continue to earn interest on any balance that remains in the pension plan.  The Company also has various retirement plans for its non-U.S. employees and maintains a Supplemental Officers Retirement Plan ( SORP ).  The SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company pays supplemental pension benefits to certain corporate officers upon retirement based upon the officers' years of service and compensation.  As of January 23, 2014, newly appointed corporate officers are no longer eligible to participate in the SORP. 
    
  A   June 30   measurement date was used in determining the Company's benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets. 
  The Company is required to (a) recognize in its Consolidated Balance Sheets an asset for a plan's net overfunded status or a liability for a plan's net underfunded status, (b) measure a plan's assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer's fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the year in which the changes occur in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).   
    
  The Company's pension plans' funded status as of   June 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

61 

The amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   June 30, 2016   and   2015   consisted of: 

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was   $1,825.1 million   and   $1,645.4 million     at   June 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Company's pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of   June 30, 2016   and   2015   had the following projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets: 

The components of net pension expense were as follows: 

Net pension expense for fiscal   2015   and   2014   includes   $4.3 million   and   $5.4 million  , respectively, reported within earnings from discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.  Included within pension expense related to discontinued operations for fiscal   2015   were total one-time charges of   $3.2 million   for curtailment charges and special termination benefits directly attributable to the spin-off of CDK. 
    
  The net actuarial loss and prior service credit for the defined benefit pension plans that are included in accumulated other comprehensive income that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost are   $464.0 million   and   $23.4 million  , respectively, at   June 30, 2016  .  There is no remaining transition obligation for the defined benefit pension plans included in accumulated other comprehensive income.  The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service credit for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost over the next fiscal year are   $21.3 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, at   June 30, 2016  . 
    
  Assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were:        

62 

Assumptions used to determine the net pension expense generally were: 

The discount rate is based upon published rates for high-quality fixed-income investments that produce cash flows that approximate the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments. 
    
  The expected long-term rate of return on assets is determined based on historical and expected future rates of return on plan assets considering the target asset mix and the long-term investment strategy.   
    
  Plan Assets 
    
  The Company's pension plans' asset allocations at   June 30, 2016   and   2015   by asset category were as follows: 

The Company's pension plans' asset investment strategy is designed to ensure prudent management of assets, consistent with long-term return objectives and the prompt fulfillment of all pension plan obligations.  The investment strategy and asset mix were developed in coordination with an asset liability study conducted by external consultants to maximize the funded ratio with the least amount of volatility. 
    
  The pension plans' assets are currently invested in various asset classes with differing expected rates of return, correlations, and volatilities, including large capitalization and small capitalization U.S. equities, international equities, U.S. fixed income securities, and cash. 
    
  The target asset allocation ranges for the U.S. plan are generally as follows: 

The pension plans' fixed income portfolio is designed to match the duration and liquidity characteristics of the pension plans' liabilities.  In addition, the pension plans invest only in investment-grade debt securities to ensure preservation of capital.  The pension plans' equity portfolios are subject to diversification guidelines to reduce the impact of losses in single investments.  Investment managers are prohibited from buying or selling commodities and from the short selling of securities. 
    
  None of the pension plans' assets are directly invested in the Company's stock, although the pension plans may hold a minimal amount of Company stock to the extent of the Company's participation in equity indices. 
    
  The pension plans' investments included in Level 1 are valued using closing prices for identical instruments that are traded on active exchanges.  The pension plans' investments included in Level 2 are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service, which are reviewed by the Company for reasonableness.  To determine the fair value of our Level  
  
   63 

2 plan assets, a variety of inputs are utilized, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information.  The pension plans have no Level 3 investments at   June 30, 2016  .   
    
  The following table presents the investments of the pension plans measured at fair value at   June 30, 2016  :   

In addition to the investments in the above table, the pension plans also held cash and cash equivalents of   $60.3 million   as of   June 30, 2016  , which have been classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.   
    
  The following table presents the investments of the pension plans measured at fair value at   June 30, 2015  :   

In addition to the investments in the above table, the pension plans also held cash and cash equivalents of   $185.4 million   as of   June 30, 2015  , which have been classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.    
    
  Contributions 
       
  During fiscal   2016  , the Company contributed   $11.0 million   to the pension plans.  The Company expects to contribute   $11.0 million   to the pension plans during fiscal   2017  . 
    
  Estimated Future Benefit Payments 
    
  The benefits expected to be paid in each year from fiscal   2017   to the year ended June 30, 2021 are   $79.0 million  ,   $83.7 million  ,   $91.0 million  ,   $99.2 million   and   $110.2 million  , respectively.  The aggregate benefits expected to be paid in the five fiscal years from the year ended June 30, 2022 to the year ended June 30, 2026 are   $673.3 million  .  The expected benefits to be paid are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company's pension plans' benefit obligations at   June 30, 2016   and includes estimated future employee service. 
    
  C. Retirement and Savings Plan.    The Company has a 401(k) retirement and savings plan, which allows eligible employees to contribute up to   50%   of their compensation annually and allows highly compensated employees to contribute up to   12%   of their compensation annually.  The Company matches a portion of employee contributions, which amounted to approximately   $81.9 million  ,   $69.7 million  , and   $66.0 million   for the calendar years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014  , and   2013  , respectively. 

NOTE   10  . INCOME TAXES 
    
  Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes shown below are based on the geographic location to which such earnings are attributable. 
  
   64 

The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following components: 

A reconciliation between the Company's effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate is as follows: 

65 

The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classifications are as follows: 

The prospective adoption of ASU 2015-17 resulted in   no   current deferred tax assets included in other current assets and   no   current deferred tax liabilities included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at   June 30, 2016  .  There are   $33.0 million   of current deferred tax assets included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at   June 30, 2015  .  There are   $57.0 million   of current deferred tax liabilities included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at   June 30, 2015  .  There are   $100.3 million   and   $61.9 million   of long-term deferred tax assets included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at   June 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of approximately   $443.2 million   as of   June 30, 2016  , as the Company considers such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the United States.  The additional U.S. income tax that would arise on repatriation of the remaining undistributed earnings could be offset, in part, by foreign tax credits on such repatriation.  However, it is impracticable to estimate the amount of net income tax that might be payable. 
    
  The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately   $50.2 million   as of   June 30, 2016  , of which   $29.8 million   expire through   2036   and   $20.4 million   have an indefinite utilization period.  As of   June 30, 2016  , the Company has approximately   $39.0 million   of federal net operating loss carry-forwards from acquired companies.  The net operating losses have an annual utilization limitation pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and expire through   2031  .   
    
  The Company has state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately   $242.3 million   as of   June 30, 2016  , which expire through   2035  . 
    
  The Company has recorded valuation allowances of   $15.4 million   and   $23.7 million   at   June 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, to reflect the estimated amount of domestic and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized.   
    
  Income tax payments were approximately   $651.6 million  ,   $773.3 million  , and   $821.5 million   for fiscal   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively. 
  
   66 

As of June 30,   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014   the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were   $27.4 million  ,   $27.1 million  , and   $56.5 million   respectively.  The amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is   $18.7 million  ,   $16.9 million  , and   $31.0 million  , respectively.  The remainder, if recognized, would principally impact deferred taxes.   
    
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

Interest expense and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions have been recorded in the provision for income taxes on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.  During the fiscal years   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , the Company recorded interest expense (benefit) of   $1.1 million  ,   $(2.7) million  , and   $(3.4) million  , respectively.  Penalties incurred during fiscal years   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014   were   no  t material.   
    
  At   June 30, 2016  , the Company had accrued interest of   $4.0 million   recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which   $0.1 million   was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities.  At   June 30, 2015  , the Company had accrued interest of   $3.8 million   recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which   $0.1 million   was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities.  At   June 30, 2016  , the Company had accrued penalties of   $0.2 million   recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other liabilities.  At   June 30, 2015  , the Company had accrued penalties of   $0.3 million   recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other liabilities.   
    
  The Company is routinely examined by the IRS and tax authorities in foreign countries in which it conducts business, as well as tax authorities in states in which it has significant business operations.  The tax years currently under examination vary by jurisdiction.  Examinations in progress in which the Company has significant business operations are as follows: 

The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments resulting from examinations in each of the jurisdictions.  The resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Company's Statements of Consolidated Earnings for a particular future period and on the Company's effective tax rate. 
    
  If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may  
  
   67 

increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions.  Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to   $2 million   in the next twelve months.  Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty.  We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. 
    
  In fiscal   2016  , the IRS completed its review of the examination of the Company's tax return for the year ended June 30,   2014  , which did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 

NOTE   11  . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  The Company has obligations under various facilities, equipment leases and software license agreements. Minimum commitments under these obligations with a future life of greater than one year at   June 30, 2016   are as follows: 

In addition to fixed rentals, certain leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. 
    
  As of   June 30, 2016  , the Company has purchase commitments of approximately     $625.2 million  , including a reinsurance premium with Chubb for the fiscal     2017     policy year, as   well as obligations related to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets, of which   $331.1 million   relates to fiscal   2017  ,   $111.3 million   relates to the fiscal year ending June 30,   2018  , and the remaining   $182.8 million   relates to fiscal years ending June 30,   2019   through fiscal   2021  . 
    
  In July 2016, Uniloc USA, Inc. and Uniloc Luxembourg, S.A. ( Uniloc ) filed a lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Company products and services infringe four patents.  Uniloc alleges infringement of its patents concerning centralized management of application programs on a network, distribution of application programs to a target station on a network, management of configurable application programs on a network, and license use management on a network.  The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, costs, and injunctive relief.  This litigation is still in its earliest stages and the Company is unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss, or range of loss, with respect to this matter.  The Company intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit.  
    
  During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, in the course of a compliance review of its clients and vendors globally, the Company determined that subsidiaries of the Company had previously entered into service arrangements outside the United States of America ("U.S.") with several entities that are designated as Specially Designated Nationals ( SDNs ) by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ) of the U.S. Department of Treasury.  Under these service arrangements, the Company provided managed service solutions to the SDNs. Immediately following the discovery of such service arrangements, the Company terminated the service arrangements with each SDN.  The Company has voluntarily notified OFAC of the service arrangements and is cooperating fully with OFAC.  The Company may be subject to fines and penalties, which amounts would be based on such factors OFAC may consider relevant.  At this time, the Company is unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss, or range of reasonably possible loss, with respect to this matter.  This is primarily because this matter involves a complex issue subject to inherent uncertainty.  There can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in a manner that is not adverse to the Company.  For more information regarding this matter, see below in Part II Item 9B,   Other Information   of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

68 

In June 2011, the Company received a Commissioner s Charge from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) alleging that the Company has violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by refusing to recruit, hire, transfer and promote certain persons on the basis of their race, in the State of Illinois from at least the period of January 1, 2007 to the present.  In July 2016, the Company entered into a settlement with the EEOC that resolved all matters related to the Commissioner s Charge without admitting any of the EEOC s allegations.  The terms of the settlement did not have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
    
  The Company is subject to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business.  When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the ultimate loss.  Management currently believes that the resolution of these claims and litigation against us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.   
    
  It is not the Company s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements.  In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company s services and products.  The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties. 

NOTE   12  .  RECLASSIFICATION OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  
    
  Comprehensive income is a measure of income that includes both net earnings and other comprehensive income (loss).  Other comprehensive income (loss) results from items deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in stockholders' equity.  Other comprehensive income (loss) was   $45.5 million  ,   $(350.6) million  , and   $162.8 million   in fiscal   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively.  Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI") by component are as follows: 

69 

(A) Reclassification adjustments out of AOCI are included within net earnings from discontinued operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. 
    
  (B) Reclassification adjustments out of AOCI are included within Other income, net, on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. 
    
  (C) Reclassification adjustments out of AOCI are included in net pension expense (see Note   9  ). 
    
  (D) Reclassification adjustment out of AOCI is related to the CDK spin-off and included in retained earnings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

NOTE   13  . FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA 
    
  Based upon similar economic and operational characteristics, the Company s strategic business units have been aggregated into the following   two   reportable segments: Employer Services and PEO Services.  The primary components of the  Other  segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity, non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, the elimination of intercompany transactions, interest expense, certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense, and beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the historical results of the AMD business, which was previously reported in the Employer Services segment.  This change, which is adjusted for both the current period and the prior period in the table above, did not significantly affect reportable segment results and is consistent with the way the chief operating decision maker assesses the performance of the reportable segments.    
    
  Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons.  Other costs are recorded based on management responsibility.  There is a reconciling item for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of   4.5%  .  This allocation is made for management reasons so that the reportable segments' results are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in interest rates.  This reconciling adjustment to the reportable segments' revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes is eliminated in consolidation.   

70 

NOTE   14  .  QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS (UNAUDITED) 
    
  Summarized quarterly results of our operations for the two fiscal years ended June 30,   2016   and June 30,   2015   are as follows:     

71 

(A) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes; net earnings from continuing operations; net earnings; and basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations include the gain on the sale of AMD.  This increased earnings from continuing operations before income taxes by   $29.1 million  , net earnings from continuing operations and net earnings by   $21.8 million  , and basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by   $0.05  .           
  (B) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes; net earnings from continuing operations; net earnings; and basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations include the gain on sale of a building.  This increased earnings from continuing operations before income taxes by   $13.9 million  , net earnings from continuing operations and net earnings by   $8.6 million   and basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by   $0.02  .           
  (C) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes; net earnings from continuing operations; net earnings; and basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations include the charge for the workforce optimization effort.  This decreased earnings from continuing operations before income taxes by   $48.2 million  , net earnings from continuing operations and net earnings by   $31.8 million   and basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by   $0.07  .           

NOTE   15  . SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
    
  With the exception of the legal claim filed in July 2016 and the settlement of the EEOC matter, both of which are discussed in Note 11, and the items listed below, there are no further subsequent events for disclosure. 
    
  In July 2016, ADP announced its service alignment initiative intended to align the Company's client service operations with its platform simplification strategy. 
    
  The Company's subsidiary captive insurance company, ADP Indemnity, paid a premium of   $221.0 million   in July 2016 to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses for the fiscal 2017 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2016 reinsurance policy to cover losses up to   $1 million   per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure  
  None.  
   
  Item 9A. Controls and Procedures  
  Attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are certifications of ADP's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required by Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). This  Controls and Procedures  section should be read in conjunction with the report of Deloitte   Touche LLP that appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.  
  Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
  The Company carried out an evaluation (the  evaluation ), under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   June 30, 2016   in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.  
  Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  It is the responsibility of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.'s ( ADP ) management to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to ADP's management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  
  ADP's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ADP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADP are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADP's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of ADP. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  
  Management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of ADP s internal control over financial reporting as of   June 30, 2016   based upon criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management determined that ADP s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of   June 30, 2016  .

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
  Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  
  Roseland, New Jersey  
    
  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016 of the Company and our report dated   August 5, 2016  , expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule.

Item 9B. Other Information  
  Compliance Disclosure  
    
  Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, or ITRA, which added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act, we are required to disclose in our annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities that are subject to sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. 
  Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995 prohibited, among other things, the exportation of any goods, technology or services from the United States to Iran, the Government of Iran, or any entity owned or controlled by the Government of Iran.  On January 9, 2007, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, designated Bank Sepah as a Specially Designated National, or SDN, under Executive Order 13382 ( EO 13382 ), and on October 25, 2007, OFAC designated Bank Melli as an SDN under EO 13382. As of their respective designation dates, the property and interests in property of each of Bank Sepah and Bank Melli were blocked pursuant to EO 13382 and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 544.  On October 25, 2007, OFAC designated Bank Saderat as an SDN under Executive Order 13224 ( EO 13224 ), and Bank Saderat s property and interests in property were blocked pursuant to EO 13224 and the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 594.  On February 6, 2012, the property and interests in property of all three banks were blocked also under Executive Order 13599, which blocked all property and interests in property of the Government of Iran and any Iranian financial institution within the United States or the possession or control of any U.S. person. 
  As previously disclosed, during the Company s second quarter of fiscal 2016, in the course of a compliance review of its clients and vendors globally, the Company determined that two of its French subsidiaries had previously entered into client service arrangements with each of the SDNs listed above (in 2001 in the case of Bank Saderat and in 1996 in the case of each of Bank Sepah and Bank Melli).  More specifically, the Company discovered that since 1996 for each of Bank Sepah and Bank Melli, and since 2001 regarding Bank Saderat, these ADP subsidiaries had provided a managed services solution to these SDNs, involving the monthly calculation of payroll data, and the associated preparation and filing (on behalf of the SDNs) of monthly, quarterly and annual social benefits declarations to the applicable French governmental authorities. Neither of these ADP subsidiaries, nor any other affiliate of the Company, provided any money movement services to such SDNs or to the employees of such SDNs.  The aggregate gross revenue and aggregate net profits received by the Company since inception of the service arrangements in 1996 and 2001 is estimated to be $185,000 of aggregate gross revenue and $35,000 of aggregate net profits.   
  Immediately following its discovery of such service arrangements, the Company terminated the service arrangements with each SDN and ceased providing such services.  The Company voluntarily notified OFAC of the service arrangements and is cooperating fully with OFAC.  As part of its compliance review, the Company completed a thorough analysis of all client and vendor relationships worldwide, and filed a report of its findings with OFAC on June 9, 2016.  The report did not identify any potential sanctions violations that had not been previously reported to OFAC.  The Company may be subject to fines and penalties, which amounts would be based on such factors as OFAC may consider relevant and are not reasonably estimable at this time.

  AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. (the    Company   ), pursuant to the 2008 Omnibus Award Plan (the    Plan   ), hereby irrevocably grants you (   Participant   ), on [DATE] (the    Grant Date   ), a Performance Stock Unit Award (the    Award   ) of forfeitable performance stock units of the Company (   PSUs   ), each PSU representing the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock, par value $0.10 per share (   Common Stock   ), subject to the restrictions, terms and conditions herein. 
  WHEREAS, Participant has been selected as a participant in the three-year performance stock unit program of the Company covering the Company s 20[XX], 20[XX] and 20[XX] fiscal years, as described in the letter previously provided to Participant (the    PSU Award Letter    and 
  WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee (the    Committee   ) of the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to grant the award provided for herein to Participant, on the terms and conditions described in this Performance Stock Unit Award Agreement (this    Agreement   ). 
  NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the promises and the covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, for themselves, and their permitted successors and assigns, hereby agree as follows: 
           1. 
    Terms and Conditions  . 
       
  (a)  Award  .  Subject to the other terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the actual number of PSUs that are earned, if any, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Award will be determined by the Company (the    Total Award   ) and shall be computed in accordance with Section 3 below, as a percentage of the sum of (i) the Target Number of PSUs set forth in the PSU Award Letter (the    Target Award   ) plus (ii) any Dividend Equivalent PSUs (as defined below).  The Total Award shall be a whole number of PSUs only. 
    
  (b)  Performance Period; Measurement Period  .  Subject to the other terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the performance period for the Award commenced on July 1, 20[XX] and shall terminate on June 30, 20[XX] (the    Performance Period   ).  During the Performance Period there will be three (3) separate measurement periods (each, a    Measurement Period   ) of the Company s performance based on a financial metric established by the Committee and communicated to the Participant (the    Financial Metric   ).   
    
  (c)  Dividend Equivalents  .  Until shares of Common Stock are delivered to Participant in respect of the settlement of the Award, at no time shall Participant be deemed for any purpose to be the owner of shares of Common Stock in connection with the Award and Participant shall have no right to dividends in respect of the Award;   provided  ,   however  , that each time the Company pays a dividend with respect to a share of Common Stock during the period from the Grant Date to the Payout Date (as defined below), Participant shall be credited with an additional number of PSUs (the    Dividend Equivalent PSUs   ) equal to (i) the quotient obtained by dividing the amount of such dividend by the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of a share of Common Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the Target Award. 
    
  (d)  Settlement  .  For Participants whose home country is the United States, subject to the other terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the Company shall settle the Award by causing one share of Common Stock for each PSU in the Total Award that is outstanding (and not previously forfeited) as of the Payout Date to be registered in the name of Participant and held in book-entry form on the Payout Date. For Participants whose home country is not the United States, subject to the other terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the Company shall settle the Award by the payment to the Participant in cash (without interest) of an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the PSUs (the U.S. dollar value of your PSUs will be converted into your local currency using the exchange rate determined by the Company) on the Payout Date, in each case, subject to applicable withholding taxes.  
    
           2. 
    Forfeiture of PSUs  .   
       
  (a)  Termination of Employment Generally  .  Except as otherwise determined by the Company in its sole discretion or as provided in Section 2(b) or Section 3(d) below, all PSUs and Dividend Equivalent PSUs  

shall be forfeited without consideration to Participant upon Participant s termination of employment with the Company or its Affiliates for any reason (and Participant shall forfeit any rights to receive shares of Common Stock or cash in respect of the Award). 
    
  (b)  Termination due to Death, Disability or Retirement  .  In the event that after completion of the first Measurement Period in the Performance Period but prior to the end of the Performance Period, Participant s employment with the Company is terminated due to death, Disability (as defined in the Plan) or retirement (defined for purposes of this Agreement as voluntary termination of employment at or after age 65, or age 55 with 10 years of service with the Company or its Affiliates), Participant shall be entitled to receive a pro-rata portion of the Award determined in accordance with Section 3.  For the avoidance of doubt, if a Participant s employment is terminated prior to June 30, 20[XX] due to death, Disability or retirement, the Award and any rights to receive shares of Common Stock, cash and Dividend Equivalent PSUs with respect thereto, will be forfeited without consideration. 
    
           3. 
          Performance Determinations  .  
       
  (a)  Subject to the other terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, prior to or during each Measurement Period, the Company will adopt a schedule setting forth for such Measurement Period potential ranges of the Company s Financial Metric (which may be an absolute dollar or other value for such period, or growth percentage relative to a prior period, as the Company may determine).  If Participant is employed with the Company or its Affiliates at the completion of the Performance Period, then following completion of the Performance Period the Company will determine the Total Award, calculated as the number (rounded down to the nearest whole PSU) equal to the product of (i) the Target Award plus any Dividend Equivalent PSUs and (ii) the Final Payout Percentage. 
    
  (b)  If Participant s employment with the Company or its Affiliates has terminated after the first Measurement Period within the Performance Period but prior to the end of the Performance Period due to death or Disability, then as soon as administratively feasible (in the Committee s sole discretion) following such termination the Company will determine the Total Award, calculated as the number (rounded down to the nearest whole PSU) equal to the product of (i) the Target Award plus any Dividend Equivalent PSUs, (ii) the Final Payout Percentage, and (iii) the Pro-Rata Percentage.   
    
  (c)  If Participant s employment with the Company and its Affiliates has terminated after the first Measurement Period within the Performance Period but prior to the end of the Performance Period due to retirement, then following completion of the Performance Period the Company will determine the Total Award, calculated as the number (rounded down to the nearest whole PSU) equal to the product of (i) the Target Award plus any Dividend Equivalent PSUs, (ii) the Final Payout Percentage, and (iii) the Pro-Rata Percentage. 
    
  (d)  If Participant s employment with the Company or its Affiliates (or any successor thereto) is terminated within 24 months following a Change in Control either (x) by the Company or its Affiliates (or any successor thereto) without Cause (as defined in the Company s Change in Control Severance Plan for Corporate Officers, as amended (the  CIC Plan )) or (y) by Participant with Good Reason (as defined in the CIC Plan), then as soon as administratively feasible following such termination by the Company or its Affiliates (or any successor thereto), the Company (or any successor thereto) will determine the Total Award, calculated as the number (rounded down to the nearest whole PSU) equal to the product of (i) the Target Award plus any Dividend Equivalent PSUs and (ii) the Final Payout Percentage. 
    
  (e)  If in connection with a Change in Control the successor company, or a parent of the successor company, in the Change in Control does not agree to assume, replace, or substitute the PSUs granted hereunder (as of the consummation of such Change in Control) with PSUs on substantially identical terms, as determined by the Committee, then as of immediately prior to such Change in Control, the Company will determine the Total Award, calculated as the number (rounded down to the nearest whole PSU) equal to the product of (i) the Target Award plus any Dividend Equivalent PSUs and (ii) the Final Payout Percentage. 
    
  (f)  For purposes of this Agreement: 
    
           (i)

Payout Percentage shall not exceed 100% (the    TSR Cap      provided  ,   further  , that the TSR Cap shall not apply to any Participant whose employment terminates due to death or Disability prior to completion of the Performance Period or if a Change of Control occurs prior to the completion of the Performance Period. 
    
           (ii) 
       Payout Date    shall be:  

September 20[XX] or as soon as administratively feasible (but not later than 60 days) thereafter if Participant remains employed with the Company or its Affiliates until the end of the Performance Period;  

September 20[XX] or as soon as administratively feasible (but not later than 60 days) thereafter if Participant s employment with the Company and its Affiliates terminates due to retirement after completion of the first Measurement Period in the Performance Period but prior to the end of the Performance Period;   provided     that   if Participant subsequently dies or becomes Disabled during the Performance Period, the Payout Date shall be as soon as administratively feasible (but not later than 60 days) after Participant s death or Disability;  

as soon as administratively feasible (but not later than 60 days) after termination of employment if Participant s employment with the Company and its Affiliates terminates due to death or Disability after completion of the first Measurement Period in the Performance Period but prior to the end of the Performance Period, or if Section 3(d) applies; and 

immediately prior to the Change in Control if Section 3(e) applies.  
       
           (iii) 
       Pro-Rata Percentage    is a number, expressed as a percentage, equal to the quotient of (i) the number of completed months from July 1, 20[XX] until the date of Participant s termination of employment, divided by (ii) 36.

  AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. 2008 OMNIBUS AWARD PLAN 
  STOCK OPTION GRANT AGREEMENT 
    
  AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. (the  Company ), pursuant to the 2008 Omnibus Award Plan (the  Plan ), hereby irrevocably grants you (the  Participant ), on [DATE] the right and option to purchase  shares of the Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company subject to the restrictions, terms and conditions herein. 
  WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee (the  Committee ) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the  Board ) has determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to grant the award of options provided for herein to the Participant, on the terms and conditions described in this Stock Option Grant Agreement (this  Agreement ). 
  NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and the covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, for themselves, their successors and assigns, hereby agree as follows: 
           1. 
    The option herein granted shall become exercisable in whole or in part as follows: 
       
           (a) 
    Exercisable as to   25%   of the shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) on the   first anniversary   of the grant date. 
       
           (b) 
    Exercisable as to an additional   25%   of the shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) on the   second anniversary   of the grant date.  
       
           (c) 
    Exercisable as to an additional   25%   of the shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) on the   third anniversary   of the grant date. 
       
           (d) 
    Exercisable in its entirety on and after the   fourth anniversary   of the grant date; and 
       
           (e) 
    Exercisable in its entirety (  i  ) upon the death of the Participant, or (  ii  ) in the event of total and permanent disability of the Participant. 
       
           (f) 
    If the Participant retires from the Company at any time following the first anniversary of this Agreement and at such time satisfies the Normal Retirement Criteria, the option herein granted shall continue to become exercisable as set forth in clauses (b) through (d) of this Section 1.  The Normal Retirement Criteria will be satisfied if the Participant shall (  i  ) retire (  and satisfy the Company s criteria for retirement at such time  ) from the Company or any of its subsidiaries, divisions or business units, as the case may be, (  ii  ) be at least 55 years of age at the time of such retirement, and (  iii  ) have at least ten credited years of service with the Company or its subsidiaries at the time of such retirement. 
       
           (g) 
    If a Participant who at the time of retirement satisfies the Normal Retirement Criteria subsequently dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled before such Participant s option herein granted becomes exercisable in its entirety as set forth in clause (d) of this Section 1, the option herein granted shall become exercisable as set forth in clause (e) of this Section 1. 
       
           (h) 
    If a Participant who at the time of retirement satisfies the criteria set forth in Section 2(b)(iv) subsequently dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled before the expiration of 12 months after the retirement of the Participant, such Participant s option herein granted shall become exercisable as set forth in clause (e) of this Section 1. 
       
           (i) 
    If, within 24 months following a Change in Control, the Participant s employment with the Company or its Affiliates (or any successor thereto) is terminated either (x) by the Company or its Affiliates (or any successor thereto) without Cause (as defined in the Company s Change in Control Severance Plan for Corporate Officers, as amended (the  CIC Plan )) or (y) by the Participant with Good Reason (as defined in the CIC Plan), the option granted hereunder shall become exercisable in its entirety as of the date of such termination. 
       
           (j) 
    Except as provided in clauses (f) through (i) of this Section 1 or as the Committee may otherwise determine in its sole discretion, no option herein granted shall become exercisable following termination of the Participant s employment from  

the Company or any of its subsidiaries (and no option herein granted shall become exercisable following the Company s sale of the subsidiary, or the Company s or a subsidiary s sale of the division or business unit, that employs such Participant). 
    
           (k) 
    Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 1, the option granted hereunder shall become exercisable in its entirety as of immediately prior to the consummation of a Change in Control, unless the successor company, or a parent of the successor company in the Change in Control agrees to assume, replace, or substitute the option granted hereunder (as of the consummation of such Change in Control) with an option on substantially identical terms, as determined by the Committee. 
       
           2. 
    The unexercised portion of the option herein granted shall automatically and without notice terminate and become null and void at the time of the earliest of the following to occur: 
       
           (a) 
    the expiration of ten years from the date on which the option was granted; 
       
           (b) 
    the expiration of 60 days from the date of termination of the Participant s employment from the Company (including in connection with the sale of the subsidiary, division or business unit that employs such Participant) or any of its subsidiaries;   provided, however  , that  
       
           (  i  ) 
    if the Participant s employment from the Company or any of its subsidiaries terminates because of total and permanent disability, the provisions of sub-paragraph (c) shall apply, 
       
           (  ii  ) 
    if the Participant shall die during employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or during the 60-day period following the date of termination of such employment, the provisions of sub-paragraph (d) below shall apply, 
       
           (  iii  ) 
    if the Participant shall retire and satisfy the Normal Retirement Criteria, the provisions of sub-paragraph (e) below shall apply, and 
       
           (iv) 
    if the Participant shall (  I  ) retire (  and satisfy the Company s criteria for retirement at such time  ) from the Company or any of its subsidiaries, divisions or business units, as the case may be, (  II  ) be at least 55 years of age at the time of such retirement, and (III) have at least five (but less than ten) credited years of service with the Company and its subsidiaries at the time of such retirement, the provisions of sub-paragraph (f) below shall apply; 
       
           (c) 
    if Section 2(b)(i) applies, (i) if the Participant satisfied the Normal Retirement Criteria at the time of Participant s total and permanent disability, the expiration of 36 months after termination of Participant s employment from the Company or any of its subsidiaries because of total and permanent disability, or (ii) if the Participant did not satisfy the Normal Retirement Criteria at the time of Participant s total and permanent disability, the expiration of 12 months after termination of Participant s employment from the Company or any of its subsidiaries because of total and permanent disability;   provided  ,   however  , that if the Participant shall die during the 36-month period specified in clause (i) of this Section 2(c) or the 12-month period specified in clause (ii) of this Section 2(c), as applicable, then the unexercised portion shall become null and void upon the expiration of 12 months after death of the Participant; 
       
           (d) 
    if Section 2(b)(ii) applies, (  i  ) if the Participant satisfied the Normal Retirement Criteria at the time of death, the expiration of 36 months after death of the Participant, or (  ii  ) if the Participant did not satisfy the Normal Retirement Criteria at the time of death, 12 months after death of the Participant; 
       
           (e) 
    if Section 2(b)(iii) applies, the expiration of 37 months after the retirement of the Participant;   provided  ,   however  , that if such Participant shall die during the 37 month period following the date of such Participant s retirement, then the unexercised portion shall become null and void on the later of (  i  ) the expiration of 37 months after the retirement of the Participant and (  ii  ) 12 months after death of the Participant; and 
       
           (f) 
    if Section 2(b)(iv) applies, the expiration of 12 months after the retirement of the Participant;   provided  ,   however  , that if such Participant shall die during the 12 month period following the date of such Participant s retirement, then the unexercised portion shall become null and void on the expiration of 12 months after death of the Participant. 
       
           3. 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any unexercised portion of the option herein granted would terminate and become null and void in accordance with Section 2 and the Fair Market Value of the unexercised portion of the option herein granted exceeds the full price for each of the shares purchased pursuant to such option, the then vested portion of the option herein granted shall be deemed to be automatically exercised by the Participant on such last trading day by means of  a net  

exercise without any action by the Participant.  Upon such automatic exercise, the Company shall deliver to the Participant the number of shares of Common Stock for which the option was deemed exercised less the number of shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value, as of such date, sufficient to (1) pay the full price for each of the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to the option herein granted and (2) satisfy all applicable required tax withholding obligations.  Any fractional share shall be settled in cash.   For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any provision (or interpretation) of Section 2 to the contrary, the unexercised portion of the option herein granted shall automatically and without notice terminate and become null and void upon the expiration of ten years from the date of this Agreement. 
    
           4. 
    The full price for each of the shares purchased pursuant to the option herein granted shall be $  XX.XX  . 
       
           5. 
    Full payment for shares purchased by the Participant shall be made at the time of the exercise of the option in whole or in part. No shares shall be issued until full payment therefore has been made, and the Participant shall have none of the rights of a shareholder with respect to any shares subject to this option until such shares shall have been issued. 
       
           6. 
    No option granted hereunder may be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate. 
       
           7. 
    In the event of one or more stock splits, stock dividends, stock changes, reclassifications, recapitalizations or combinations of shares prior to complete exercise of the option herein granted which change the character or amount of the shares subject to the option, this option to the extent that it shall not have been exercised, shall entitle the Participant or the Participant s executors or administrators to receive in substitution such number and kind of shares as he, she or they would have been entitled to receive if the Participant or the Participant s executors or administrators had actually owned the shares subject to this option at the time of the occurrence of such change;   provided, however   that if the change is of such nature that the Participant or the Participant s executors or administrators, upon exercise of the option, would receive property other than shares of stock, then the Board shall adjust the option so that he, she or they shall acquire only shares of stock upon exercise, making such adjustment in the number and kind of shares to be received as the Board shall, in its sole judgment, deem equitable;   provided  ,   further  , that the foregoing shall not limit the Company s ability to otherwise adjust the option in a manner consistent with Section 12 of the Plan. 
       
           8. 
    The option granted hereunder is conditioned upon the Participant s agreement to the Restrictive Covenant Agreement furnished herewith within six months from the date of this Agreement.  If the Company does not receive the signed (whether electronically or otherwise) restrictive covenant within such six-month period, this Agreement shall be terminable by the Company. 
       
           9. 
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the option granted hereunder may be terminated and become null and void without consideration if the Participant, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion (i) engages in an activity that is in conflict with or adverse to the interests of the Company or any Affiliate, including but not limited to fraud or conduct contributing to any financial restatements or irregularities, or (ii) without the consent of the Company, while employed by or providing services to the Company or any Affiliate or after termination of such employment or service, violates a non-competition, non-solicitation or non-disclosure covenant or agreement (including the Restrictive Covenant Agreement furnished herewith) between the Participant and the Company or any Affiliate.  If the Participant engages in any activity referred to in the preceding sentence, the Participant shall, at the sole discretion of the Committee, forfeit any gain realized in respect of the option granted hereunder (which gain shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the difference between the price for shares set forth in Section 4 above and the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan), on the applicable exercise date, of the shares of Common Stock for which the option was exercised), and repay such gain to the Company. 
       
           10. 
    The provisions of the Plan are hereby incorporated herein by reference.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and any capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the definitions set forth in the Plan.   In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and the terms of the CIC Plan that would otherwise apply to the option herein granted, the terms of this Agreement shall control. 
       
           11. 
    Any right of the Company contained in this Agreement may be waived in writing by the Committee.  No waiver of any right hereunder by any party shall operate as a waiver of any other right, or as a waiver of the same right with respect to any subsequent occasion for its exercise, or as a waiver of any right to damages.  No waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other breach or a waiver of the continuation of the same breach. 

12. 
    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and each other provision of this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law. 
       
           13. 
    Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as giving the Participant any right to be retained, in any position, as an employee, consultant or director of the Company or its Affiliates or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the right of the Company or its Affiliates, which are hereby expressly reserved, to remove, terminate or discharge the Participant with or without cause at any time for any reason whatsoever.  Although over the course of employment terms and conditions of employment may change, the at-will term of employment will not change. 
       
           14. 
    The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors and assigns, the Participant and the beneficiaries, executors, administrators, heirs and successors of the Participant. 
       
           15. 
    This Agreement, the Plan and the Restrictive Covenant Agreement contain the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein and supersede all prior communications, representations and negotiations in respect thereto; provided, however, that the Participant understands that Participant  may have an existing agreement(s) with the Company, through prior awards, acquisition of a prior employer or otherwise, that may include the same or similar covenants as those in the Restrictive Covenant Agreement furnished herewith, and acknowledges that the Restrictive Covenant Agreement is meant to supplement any such agreement(s) such that the covenants in the agreements that provide the Company with the greatest protection enforceable under applicable law shall control, and that the parties do not intend to create any ambiguity or conflict through the execution of the Restrictive Covenant Agreement that would release Participant from the obligations Participant has assumed under the restrictive covenants in any of these agreements. No change or modification of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same be in writing and signed by the parties hereto, except for any changes permitted without consent of the Participant under the Plan. 
       
           16. 
    This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of conflicts of law thereof, or principles of conflicts of laws of any other jurisdiction which could cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. 2008 OMNIBUS AWARD PLAN 
  PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT 
    
  AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. (the    Company   ), pursuant to the 2008 Omnibus Award Plan (the    Plan   ), hereby irrevocably grants you (the    Participant   ), on [DATE] (the    Grant Date   ), a Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award (the    PRSU Award   ) of forfeitable performance-based restricted stock units of the Company (   PRSUs   ), each PRSU representing the right to receive one share of the Company s Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (   Common Stock   ), subject to the restrictions, terms and conditions herein. 
  WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee (the    Committee   ) of the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to grant the award provided for herein to the Participant, on the terms and conditions described in this Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (this    Agreement   ). 
  NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the promises and the covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, for themselves, and their permitted successors and assigns, hereby agree as follows: 
           1. 
    Terms and Conditions. 
       
  (a)  Vesting of PRSUs  .  Subject to the other terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the PRSUs shall vest upon the satisfaction of both a time-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition 
    
           (1) 
    The time-based vesting condition shall be satisfied as to [XX]% of the PRSUs on July 1, 20[XX], and as to the remaining [XX]% of the PRSUs on July 1, 20[XX]. [  Note: the time-based vesting condition may vary in terms of number of years and percentage of award that vests; appropriate adjustments are made to Section 1(b) to reflect the time-based vesting condition.] 
       
           (2) 
    The performance-based vesting condition shall be satisfied as to 100% of the PRSUs as of June 30, 20[XX], provided that the Company has achieved the performance metric established by the Company and separately communicated to the Participant, such achievement to be determined by the Committee at its regularly scheduled meeting on or around August 20[XX];   provided  ,   however  , that in the event of a Change in Control, the performance-based vesting condition shall be deemed satisfied (as of immediately prior to such Change in Control) as to 100% of the PRSUs. 
       
           (3) 
    If the Participant s employment with the Company or its Affiliates (or any successor thereto) is terminated within 24 months following a Change in Control either (x) by the Company or its Affiliates (or any successor thereto) without Cause (as defined in the Company s Change in Control Severance Plan for Corporate Officers, as amended (the    CIC Plan   )), or (y) by the Participant with Good Reason (as defined in the CIC Plan), then 100% of the PRSUs granted hereunder shall vest in full as of such termination. 
       
           (4) 
    If in connection with a Change in Control the successor company, or a parent of the successor company, in the Change in Control does not agree to assume, replace, or substitute the PRSUs granted hereunder (as of the consummation of such Change in Control) with PRSUs on substantially identical terms, as determined by the Committee, then the PRSUs granted hereunder shall vest in full as of immediately prior to such Change in Control. 
       
  (b)  Settlement  .  Subject to the other terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the Company shall settle the PRSU Award by causing one share of Common Stock for each PRSU that is outstanding (and not previously forfeited) as of the Payout Date (as defined below) to be registered in the name of Participant and held in book-entry form on the Payout Date.  As used herein,    Payout Date    shall mean, (w) with respect to the portion of the PRSU Award that vests on July 1, 20[XX], as soon as administratively feasible (but not later than 60 days) thereafter, (x) with respect to the portion of the PRSU Award that vests on July 1, 20[XX], as soon as administratively feasible (but not later than 60 days) thereafter, (y) if Section 1(a)(3) applies, as soon as administratively feasible (but not later than 60 days) after termination of employment, and (z) if Section 1(a)(4) applies, immediately prior to the Change in Control. 
    
  (c)  Dividend Equivalents  .  Until shares of Common Stock are delivered to the Participant in respect of the settlement of the PRSU Award, at no time shall the Participant be deemed for any purpose to be the owner of shares of Common Stock in  

connection with the PRSU Award;   provided  ,   however  , that each time the Company pays a dividend with respect to a share of Common Stock during the period from the Grant Date to the Payout Date, the Participant shall be credited with or paid a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of PRSUs then outstanding hereunder multiplied by (ii) the per-share dividend payable to holders of record of the Common Stock (the    Dividend Equivalent Amount   ), as follows:  (x) with respect to each such dividend payable on or prior to the date on which the performance-based vesting condition is satisfied or deemed satisfied (the    Performance Vesting Date   ), the Participant shall be credited with the applicable Dividend Equivalent Amount to be paid, without interest, as soon as administratively feasible (but not later than 60 days) after the Performance Vesting Date, or if either Section 1(a)(3) or Section 1(a)(4) applies, the Payout Date, if earlier, and (y) with respect to each such dividend payable after the Performance Vesting Date, the Participant shall be paid the Dividend Equivalent Amount on the same date on which such dividend is payable to the Company s shareholders. 
    
  (d)  Forfeiture of PRSUs  .  Except as otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion or as set forth in this Section 1, unvested PRSUs (i.e., PRSUs as to which either or both of the vesting conditions have not been satisfied), and any associated unpaid Dividend Equivalent Payments, shall be forfeited without consideration to the Participant upon the Participant s termination of employment with the Company or its Affiliates for any reason.  For the avoidance of doubt, all PRSUs and Dividend Equivalent Payments shall be forfeited as of June 30, 20[XX], if the performance-based vesting condition is not been achieved. 
    
           2. 
    Restrictive Covenant Agreement; Clawback; Incorporation by Reference  . 
       
  (a)  Restrictive Covenant Agreement  .  This PRSU Award is conditioned upon the Participant s agreement to the Restrictive Covenant Agreement furnished herewith and which includes, among other provisions, certain non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disclosure covenants. If Participant does not agree (whether electronically or otherwise) to the Restrictive Covenant Agreement within ninety (90) days from the date of this PRSU Award, this PRSU Award shall be terminable by the Company. 
    
  (b)  Clawback/Forfeiture  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the PRSUs may be forfeited without consideration if the Participant, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion (i) engages in an activity that is in conflict with or adverse to the interests of the Company or any Affiliate, including but not limited to fraud or conduct contributing to any financial restatements or irregularities, or (ii) without the consent of the Company, while employed by or providing services to the Company or any Affiliate or after termination of such employment or service, violates a non-competition, non-solicitation or non-disclosure covenant or agreement (including the Restrictive Covenant Agreement furnished herewith) between the Participant and the Company or any Affiliate.  If the Participant engages in any activity referred to in the preceding sentence, the Participant shall, at the sole discretion of the Committee, forfeit any gain realized in respect of the PRSUs (which gain shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the Fair Market Value, on the applicable Payout Date of the shares of Common Stock delivered to the Participant plus the amount of any Dividend Equivalent Payments), and repay such gain to the Company.  In addition to the foregoing, the PRSUs (and any gain realized in respect thereof) shall in all respects be subject to the terms and conditions of any Company clawback/forfeiture policy as in effect from time to time to which the Participant is subject. 
    
  (c)  Incorporation by Reference, Etc  .  The provisions of the Plan are hereby incorporated herein by reference.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and any capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the definitions set forth in the Plan.  In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and the terms of the CIC Plan that would otherwise apply to the PRSUs herein granted, the terms of this Agreement shall control.  For the avoidance of doubt: (1) the terms of Section 1.2 of the CIC Plan shall not apply to the PRSUs granted under this Agreement, and (2) any acceleration of vesting of the PRSUs herein granted shall be deemed to be accelerated under the terms of the CIC Plan for purposes of Section 1.3 of the CIC Plan. 
    
  3.  Compliance with Legal Requirements  .  The granting and delivery of the PRSU Award, and any other obligations of the Company under this Agreement, shall be subject to all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may be required.  
    
  4.  Transferability  .  Until it has fully vested in accordance with Section 1, no PRSU may be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate. 
    
           5. 
    Miscellaneous  . 
       
  (a)  Waiver  .  Any right of the Company contained in this Agreement may be waived in writing by the Committee.  No waiver of any right hereunder by any party shall operate as a waiver of any other right, or as a waiver of the same right with  

respect to any subsequent occasion for its exercise, or as a waiver of any right to damages.  No waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other breach or a waiver of the continuation of the same breach.  
    
  (b)  Severability  .  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and each other provision of this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.  
    
  (c)  No Right to Employment  .  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as giving the Participant any right to be retained, in any position, as an employee, consultant or director of the Company or its Affiliates or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the right of the Company or its Affiliates, which are hereby expressly reserved, to remove, terminate or discharge the Participant with or without cause at any time for any reason whatsoever.  Although over the course of employment terms and conditions of employment may change, the at-will term of employment will not change.

              5.

              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
