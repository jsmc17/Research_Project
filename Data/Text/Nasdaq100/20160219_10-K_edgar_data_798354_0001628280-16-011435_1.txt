    Item 1.  Business 
  Overview 
  Fiserv, Inc. is a leading global provider of financial services technology. We are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and part of the S P 500 Index. We serve approximately   13,000   clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, mutual savings banks, and building societies. We provide account processing systems; electronic payments processing products and services, such as electronic bill payment and presentment services, card-based transaction processing and network services, ACH transaction processing, account-to-account transfers, and person-to-person payments; internet and mobile banking systems; and related services including document and payment card production and distribution, check processing and imaging, source capture systems, and lending and risk management products and services. Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. Our operations are principally located in the United States where we operate data and transaction processing centers, provide technology support, develop software and payment solutions, and offer consulting services. We also own a 49% interest in StoneRiver Group, L.P. ( StoneRiver ), which is comprised of our former insurance services businesses. 
  In   2015  , we had   $5.3 billion   in total revenue,   $1.3 billion   in operating income and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of   $1.3 billion  . Processing and services revenue, which in   2015   represented   84%   of our total consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates. Revenue to clients outside the United States comprised approximately   6%   of total revenue in each of   2015   and   2014   and   7%   in   2013  . 
  We have grown our business by developing highly specialized services and product enhancements, extending our capabilities through innovation, adding new clients, cross-selling to existing clients, and acquiring businesses that complement ours, which has enabled us to deliver a wide range of integrated products and services and has created new opportunities for growth. 
  We originally incorporated in Delaware in 1984 and reincorporated as a Wisconsin corporation in 1992. Our headquarters are located at 255 Fiserv Drive, Brookfield, Wisconsin 53045, and our telephone number is (262) 879-5000.

     Table of Contents  

   Our operations are reported in the Payments and Industry Products ( Payments ) and Financial Institution Services ( Financial ) business segments. Financial information regarding our business segments is included in Note   9     to the consolidated financial statements. 
  Payments 
  The businesses in our Payments segment provide financial institutions and other companies with the products and services required to process electronic payment transactions and to offer their customers access to financial services and transaction capability through digital channels. Financial institutions and other companies have increasingly relied on third-party providers for those products and services, either on a licensed software or outsourced basis, as an increasing number of payment transactions are completed electronically as our clients  customers seek the convenience of 24-hour digital access to their financial accounts. Within the Payments segment, we primarily provide debit and credit card processing and services, electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, person-to-person payment services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. Our solutions in the Payments segment include: 
  Electronic Payments 
  Our electronic payments business is comprised of electronic bill payment and presentment services and other electronic payment services for businesses and consumers, such as person-to-person payments, account-to-account transfers, account opening and funding, and small business invoicing and payments. Our principal electronic bill payment and presentment product, CheckFree        RXP       , allows our clients  customers: to manage household bills via an easy-to-use, online tool; to view billing and payment information; to pay and manage all of their bills in one place; for certain billers, to experience speed comparable to payment at a biller s site via same-day bill payment; and to make convenient next-day payments to many of the companies with which they do business. We use our systems to process the vast majority of the payment transactions that we handle, which enables us to improve our economies of scale. Once a consumer has accessed the system through a financial institution, he or she can elect to pay an electronic bill delivered by us or can instruct the system to pay individuals or companies that have bank accounts located within the U.S. 
  Our person-to-person payments solution, Popmoney       , allows consumers a convenient way to send and receive money while offering financial institutions the opportunity to generate new transaction-based revenue, attract new accounts and increase loyalty among existing customers. Popmoney Instant Payments extends the functionality of the Popmoney personal payment service by enabling near real-time exchange of funds. Popmoney can be accessed through the www.popmoney.com website, our mobile applications for iPhone        and Android       , or the websites and mobile banking applications of participating financial institutions. As of December 31,   2015  , more than 2,400 financial institutions have agreed to offer our person-to-person payments services to their customers. 
  Digital Channels 
  Our principal online consumer and business banking products for larger financial institutions are Corillian Online        and Corillian        Business Online. Corillian Online and Corillian Business Online support multiple lines of banking businesses and have been designed to be highly scalable to meet the evolving needs of our clients. This structure enables our clients to deploy new services by adding and integrating applications, such as electronic bill payment, person-to-person payments and personal financial management tools, to any internet connected point-of-presence. We provide the advanced capabilities of Corillian Online as an outsourced service or as a licensed solution. 
  Our Mobiliti        product suite provides a variety of mobile banking and payments services through a mobile or tablet device to our clients and their customers, including balance inquiry, transaction history, bill payment, person-to-person payments and transfers. It enables financial institutions to reach more consumers because it supports all three mobile access modes: mobile browser, downloadable application for smart phones and tablets, and text message. We provide an outsourced version of Mobiliti as well as a highly customizable licensed version. As of December 31,   2015  , we had approximately 2,200 mobile banking clients. 
  Card Services 
  Our card services business is a leader in electronic funds transfer and provides a total payments solution through a variety of products and services. We offer ATM and point of sale PIN-based debit transaction processing, signature debit processing, ATM processing, private label and bankcard credit card processing, and national and regional network access. We own the Accel        network and process transactions conducted at approximately 21,000 ATMs. Comprehensive integration with our account processing products and services allows us to reduce costs and increase efficiencies for our clients through enterprise offerings

   in areas such as risk management and loyalty rewards. Our card services business has nearly 4,600 relationships, including banks and credit unions of all asset sizes, finance companies, independent sales organizations and merchant acquirers across the U.S. 
  Biller Solutions 
  Our biller business provides electronic billing and payment services to companies that deliver bills to their customer base, such as utilities, telephone and cable companies, consumer lending institutions, and insurance providers, enabling our biller clients to reduce costs, collect payments faster, increase customer satisfaction, and provide customers flexible, easy-to-use ways to view and pay their bills. We believe that consumers will continue to shift their financial transactions from traditional, paper-based methods to electronic methods if they have easy-to-access, easy-to-use, secure and cost-effective methods of receiving and paying their bills electronically. Consumers use our electronic billing and payment systems by viewing or paying a bill through a financial institution s bill payment application, use of a biller s website, mobile application or automated phone system, www.mycheckfree.com, or by paying in person at one of 23,000 nationwide walk-in payment locations at retail stores operated by walk-in agents. These diverse services allow our clients  customers to view and pay bills wherever, whenever and however they feel most comfortable. Furthermore, because our biller clients are able to receive all of these services from us, we can eliminate the operational complexity and expense of supporting multiple vendor systems or in-house developed systems. 
  Output Solutions 
  Our output solutions business provides business communication solutions to clients across a wide variety of industries, including financial services, healthcare, retail, utilities, and travel and entertainment. Our products and services include: electronic document management through our electronic document delivery products and services; card manufacturing, personalization and mailing; statement production and mailing; design and fulfillment of direct mail solutions; forms distribution; laser printing and mailing; branded merchandise; and office supplies. 
  Investment Services 
  Our investment services business provides technology solutions that enable financial planning, portfolio management and trading, model management, performance measurement, and reporting products and services to approximately 300 financial service organizations, including broker dealers, registered investment advisors, banks and insurance companies that deliver financial advice and managed account products to U.S. retail investors. Our investment services business also supports global institutional asset managers with portfolio accounting, performance analytics, fee billing and revenue management, and post-trade processing technology. 
  Our fee-based wealth management clients are typically sponsors or managers that create or offer a variety of managed account programs to U.S. retail investors, including mutual fund advisory programs, separately managed accounts and unified managed accounts. Our primary product, the Unified Wealth Platform, is a real-time portfolio management, trading and reporting system used by some of the largest brokerage firms, based on assets under management, and asset managers in the U.S. offering managed accounts. Our industry-leading platform supported more than 4.8 million accounts as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  Risk Management Solutions 
  Our risk management solutions business provides financial and risk management products and services that deliver operating efficiencies and management insight which enable our clients to protect and grow their businesses. Our solutions consist of Enterprise Performance Management, Financial Crime Risk Management and Financial Control Solutions. 
  Financial 
  The businesses in our Financial segment provide financial institutions with the products and services they need to run their operations. Many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations now license software from third parties or outsource their data processing requirements by contracting with third-party processors. This has allowed them to reduce costs and enhance their products, services, capacity and capabilities. The licensing of software reduces the need for costly technical expertise within a financial institution, and outsourcing data processing operations reduces the infrastructure and other costs required to operate systems internally. Within the Financial segment, we provide banks, thrifts, credit unions, and leasing and finance companies with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Many of the products and services that we sell are integrated with solutions from our Payments segment such as electronic bill payment and presentment, internet and mobile banking, debit processing and network services, and person-to-person payments. Our solutions in the Financial segment include:

   Account Processing 
  We provide account servicing and management technology solutions to our bank, thrift and credit union clients, as well as a range of integrated, value-added banking products and services. Account processing solutions are the principal systems that enable a financial institution to operate systems that process customer deposit and loan accounts, an institution s general ledger, central information files and other financial information. These solutions also include extensive security, report generation and other features that financial institutions need to process transactions for their customers, as well as to comply with applicable regulations. Although many of our clients contract to obtain a majority of their data processing requirements from us, our software design allows clients to start with one application and, as needed, add applications and features developed by us or by third parties. We support a broad range of client-owned peripheral devices manufactured by a variety of vendors, which reduces a new client s initial conversion expenses, enhances existing clients  ability to change technology and broadens our market opportunity. 
  The principal account processing solutions used by our bank and thrift clients are Cleartouch       , DNA       , Precision       , Premier       , Signature        and TotalPlus       .

The Signature and DNA systems are available both domestically and internationally. In addition, we offer Agiliti        as a software-as-a-service solution to the UK financial services industry. Account processing solutions are generally offered as an outsourced service or as licensed software for installation on client-owned or hosted computer systems. 
  In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired Open Solutions Inc. ( Open Solutions ), a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions. Open Solutions  primary account processing product, DNA, is a real-time platform designed to enable financial institutions to easily add and customize ancillary solutions using its applications feature. This acquisition advanced our go-to-market strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide our broad array of add-on solutions.

Through the Fiserv Clearing Network, we provide complete check clearing and image exchange services.

  Our vision is to be a global leader in transaction-based technology solutions. Our mission is to provide integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients.

Consistent with this focus, we continue to operate our business in accordance with the following strategic framework: 
             
    Portfolio Management  . We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies.

Client Relationship Value  . We plan to increase the number and breadth of our client relationships by, among other actions: continuing to integrate our products, services and sales groups; combining products and services to deliver enhanced, integrated value propositions; and improving the quality of our client service and support. 
                
    Operational Effectiveness  . We believe we can improve the quality of our client delivery while reducing our costs by using the opportunities created by our size and scale. For example, we are using our consolidated buying power and optimizing our facilities to create cost savings. 
                
    Capital Discipline  . We intend to make capital allocation decisions that offer the best prospects for our long-term growth and profitability, which may include, among other matters, internal investment, repayment of debt, repurchases of our own shares or acquisitions. 
                
    Innovation  . We seek to be an innovation leader, utilizing our assets and capabilities to be at the forefront of our industry. 
     Servicing the Market 
  The markets for our account and transaction processing services have specific needs and requirements, with strong emphasis placed by clients on flexibility, quality, comprehensiveness and integration of product lines, service reliability, timely introduction of new products and features, and cost effectiveness. We believe that our financial strength and primary focus on the financial services industry enhances our ability to meet these needs and service our clients. In addition, we believe that our dedication to providing excellent client service and support no matter the size of the client and our commitment of substantial resources to training and technical support helps us to identify and fulfill the needs of our clients. 
  Product Development 
  To meet the changing technology needs of our clients, we continually develop, maintain and enhance our products and systems. In each of   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , product development expenditures represented approximately   9%   of our total revenue. Our development and technology centers apply the expertise of multiple teams to design, develop and maintain specialized processing systems. Our account processing systems are designed to meet the preferences and diverse requirements of the international, national, regional or local market-specific financial service environments of our clients. In developing our products, we use current software development principles, such as service-oriented architecture, to create efficiencies, and we stress interaction with and responsiveness to the needs of our clients. 
  Intellectual Property 
  We regard our software, transaction processing services and related products as proprietary, and we utilize a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, internal security practices and employee and third party non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property assets. Our patents cover innovations relating to numerous financial software products and services, and we continue, where appropriate, to seek and secure patents with respect to our ongoing innovations. We believe that we possess all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business. 
  Competition 
  The market for technology products and services in the financial industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology, data processing affiliates of large companies, and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives. Outside the U.S., we see increasing competition by the largest banks, governments, telecommunications providers and other providers with significant resources. Furthermore, we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services. Some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do and have substantial flexibility in competing with us, including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing. Competitive factors for our business include product quality, security, service reliability, product line comprehensiveness and integration, timely introduction of new products and features, and price. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. Additional information about competition in our segments is provided below. 
  Payments 
  We compete with a number of competitors in our bill payment, digital channels, card services and biller businesses, including ACI Worldwide, Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

   competitors include, but are not limited to, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook, Inc., Intuit Inc., PayPal Holdings, Inc., Samsung Group, Starbucks Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Certain existing and potential financial institution and biller clients also have the ability to develop and use their own in-house systems instead of our products and services. In addition, many companies that provide solutions to the financial services industry are consolidating, creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines. 
  Financial 
  Our products and services in the Financial segment compete in several different market segments and geographies, including with large, diversified software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products. Certain existing and potential financial institution clients also have the ability to develop and use their own in-house systems. In addition, we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions, including Computer Services, Inc., DH Corporation, FIS, Infosys Ltd., International Business Machines Corporation, Jack Henry, Oracle Corporation, SAP SE and Temenos Group AG. 
  Government Regulation 
  Fiserv and its subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. However, as a provider of services to these financial institutions, our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities and representatives of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. Also, state and federal regulations require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us, such as those related to security and privacy, and to conduct ongoing monitoring and risk management for third party relationships. Because we use the Federal Reserve s ACH network to process many of our transactions, we are subject to the Federal Reserve Board s rules with respect to its ACH network. In addition, independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients  auditors. 
  In conducting our direct-to-consumer businesses, including our walk-in bill payment, online bill payment and Popmoney person-to-person payment services, we are directly subject to various federal and state laws, rules and regulations including those relating to the movement of money. In order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws, we are required, among other matters, to comply with licensing and reporting requirements, to implement operating policies and procedures necessary to comply with anti-money laundering laws, to comply with capital requirements, to protect the privacy and security of our clients  information, and to undergo periodic audits and examinations. 
  In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd-Frank Act ) was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry, including introducing changes that: affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions; provide for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies; introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements; implement changes to corporate governance and executive compensation practices; and require significant rule-making. The Dodd-Frank Act has generated numerous new regulations that have imposed compliance costs and, in some cases, limited revenue sources for us and our clients. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), which is empowered to conduct rule-making and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has issued guidance that applies to  supervised service providers,  which the CFPB has defined to include service providers, like us, to CFPB supervised banks and nonbanks. The CFPB has in the past and may in the future issue regulations that may require us to make compliance investments and/or limit our fees or other revenue sources. We do not currently anticipate a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition due to these regulations, but it is difficult to predict with certainty the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term. 
  Employees 
  We have approximately 22,000 employees globally, many of whom are specialists in our information management centers and related product and service businesses. This service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial industry, as well as employees with direct experience in payments, financial institutions and other financial services environments. Our employees provide expertise in: programming, software development, modification and maintenance; computer operations, network control and technical support; client services and training; business process outsourcing; item and mortgage processing; system conversions; sales and marketing; and account management.

   The service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset. Although the market for qualified personnel is competitive, we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining our staff of top industry professionals. In assessing a potential acquisition candidate, we emphasize the quality and stability of the acquisition candidate s employees.

    Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
  You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
  We operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively. 
  The markets for our services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. Many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications in-house. As a result, we often compete against our existing or potential clients  in-house capabilities. We also expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new well-funded competitors and new technologies, including large technology, media and other companies not historically in the financial services industry, start-ups and international providers of similar products and services to ours. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  If we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful, we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients, and our ability to grow may be limited. 
  The markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards. Our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success. We may not be successful in developing, marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands. In addition, we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of these services, or our new services and enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients, to attract new ones and to grow profitably. 
  The market for our electronic transaction services continues to evolve and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability. 
  If the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow, or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by a combination of factors including speed, cost, ease-of-use, security and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses. In addition, we may face challenges meeting local political, regulatory, business and economic conditions as we grow internationally, particularly in emerging market economies, and we may find it difficult to manage and oversee operations far from our headquarters. In order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability, consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services. The success of our electronic commerce businesses also relies in part on financial institutions, billers and other third parties to market our services to their customers. If any of these third parties abandons, curtails or insufficiently increases its marketing efforts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

   If we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms, we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
  Failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business. Our contracts with clients generally run for a period of three to five years. At the end of the contract term, clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services. If we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 
  Our business may be adversely impacted by U.S. and global market and economic conditions. 
  For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry. Given this concentration, we are exposed to the global economic conditions in the financial services industry. A prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients. 
  Failures, mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients, which could adversely affect our revenue. Further, if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. It is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Security breaches, computer malware or other  cyber attacks  could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation. 
  Our operations depend on receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, our associates, our clients and their customers. Any unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service or similar act by a malevolent party could disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems or the systems of our clients or vendors. These events could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, increased regulatory scrutiny, financial sanctions and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients and cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, as these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. Although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us, we may not be able to prevent a material event in the future, and the impact of a material event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Operational failures could harm our business and reputation. 
  An operational failure in our transaction processing businesses, including our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities, could harm our business or cause us to lose clients. An operational failure could be caused by the failure of third party networks and systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and over which we have limited or no control. Interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses, including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities. A prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue. In addition, a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  We may experience software defects, development delays or installation difficulties, which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability. 
  Our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems, and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services. Further, the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition, we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems used by our clients. Defects in our software, errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations, delay in market acceptance, additional development and  
    8

   remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of clients, negative publicity or exposure to liability claims. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements, we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability. 
  The implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and related regulations may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business. 
  In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Dodd-Frank Act ) was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act represented a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States and established, among other things, a new federal bureau called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement numerous new regulations, and the CFPB has issued guidance that applies to  supervised service providers,  which the CFPB has defined to include service providers, like us, to CFPB supervised banks and nonbanks. It is difficult to predict with certainty the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term. If the CFPB adopts additional rules and exercises supervisory authority over service providers like us, we could be subject to a greater degree of direct federal oversight than in the past, which could slow our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing industry, require us to make compliance investments and/or limit our fees or other revenue sources. To the extent the regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act negatively impact the business, operations or financial condition of our clients, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because, among other matters, our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us, could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business, or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions. We could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or oversight or to modify the manner in which we provide products and services to our clients; and such regulations could directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services. We may not be able to update our existing products and services, or develop new ones, to satisfy our clients  needs. Any of these events, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  If we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed. 
  We are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. However, as a provider of services to these financial institutions, we are subject to contractual requirements imposed by the financial institutions with respect to a number of state and federal regulations, including privacy laws, and our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities. Also, regulators are signaling interest in enforcing regulations directly against service providers to financial institutions, and any such direct enforcement could result in increased operating costs for us and additional restrictions on our business processes. If we fail to comply with any applicable regulations, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings, our client relationships and reputation could be harmed, and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level, or, with respect to our international operations, in foreign jurisdictions on the national, provincial, state or other level, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability. 
  Certain of our subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters in those states where such licensure is required. In connection with such licensure, we are required to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports. In addition, our direct-to-consumer payments businesses, including our walk-in bill payment, online bill payment and Popmoney person-to-person payment services, are subject to federal regulation in the United States, including anti-money laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities. The complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business. In addition, any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers, or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions. 
  If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks, they could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations which could adversely affect our business. 
  We are subject to card association and network rules governing Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover or other similar organizations, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard enforced by the major card brands. The rules of the card networks are set by their boards which may be influenced by card issuers, some of which offer competing transaction processing services. If we fail to comply with these rules, we could be fined, our certifications could be suspended, or our certifications could be terminated. The suspension or termination of our certifications, or any changes to the card association and network rules, that we do not successfully address, could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to  
    9 

     Table of Contents  

   clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation, which, in either case, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
  We may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others. 
  Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims. If the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are, or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is, infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or services, and such changes may be expensive or impractical, or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights. If we are unable to agree on acceptable terms, we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations. We may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights, and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them. Any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit, they may result in costly and time consuming litigation and may divert our management and key personnel from operating our business. 
  Misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position. 
  Our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology. We actively seek to protect our proprietary rights. Nevertheless, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology. Agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy. Effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available. Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Acquisitions subject us to risks, including increased debt, assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations. 
  A major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses. We anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses, products and services. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions in the future, which could adversely affect our future growth, or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may not be able to integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or realize the potential benefits of bringing them together. In addition, the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources. 
  These risks may arise for a number of reasons: we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms; we face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers; we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us; changes in accounting, tax, securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions; we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions; we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business; we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition; we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience; and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of non-cash impairment charges. 
  We may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements. 
  We have in the past and may in the future sell businesses. In connection with sales of businesses, we may make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale. Our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  The failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
  We depend on the experience, skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees. If we fail to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified management, technical, compliance and sales personnel, our future success could be harmed. Our senior management provides strategic direction for our company, and if we lose members of our leadership team, our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss. Our products and services require

   sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry, applicable regulatory and industry requirements, computer systems, and software applications, and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel, we could suffer delays in new product development, experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients  demands. 
  Our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations. 
  Our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 76% of our total assets at   December 31, 2015  . These assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill. In addition, we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired, then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations. 
  Increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations. 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , we had approximately   $4.3 billion   of long-term debt, including current maturities. We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness could: decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes; limit our flexibility to make acquisitions; increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, if our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade, we may incur additional interest expense. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements, we may be required, among other things: to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets; to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms. 
    Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments 
  None. 
    Item 2.  Properties 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , we operated data, development, item processing and support centers in approximately 110 cities. We owned seven buildings, and the more than 120 remaining locations where we operated our businesses are subject to leases. We believe our facilities and equipment are well maintained and are in good operating condition. We believe that the computer equipment that we own and our various facilities are adequate for our present and foreseeable business needs. We maintain our own, and contract with multiple service providers to provide, processing back-up in the event of a disaster. We also maintain copies of data and software used in our business in locations that are separate from our facilities. 
    Item 3.  Legal Proceedings 
  In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries are named as defendants in lawsuits in which claims are asserted against us. In the opinion of management, the liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from such lawsuits are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures 
  Not applicable.

   Overview                     
  Company Background 
  We are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve approximately   13,000   clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, mutual savings banks, and building societies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. 
  Our operations are principally located in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products ( Payments ) segment and the Financial Institution Services ( Financial ) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides debit and credit card processing and services, electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, person-to-person payment services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts, credit unions, and leasing and finance companies with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Corporate and Other primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses including share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance. 
  During 2015 and 2014, StoneRiver Group, L.P. ( StoneRiver ), a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2013, completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business, resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation. Our share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $29 million in   2015  , $87 million in   2014   and $71 million in 2013, with related tax expenses of $13 million, $36 million and $17 million, respectively. In addition, we received cash dividends, funded from capital transactions, from StoneRiver of $36 million, $110 million, and $122 million in   2015  ,   2014  , and 2013, respectively. 
  On January 14, 2013, we acquired Open Solutions Inc. ( Open Solutions ), a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions, for a cash purchase price of $55 million and the assumption of approximately $960 million of debt. With this acquisition, we added DNA, a real-time, open architecture account processing system, along with 3,300 existing Open Solutions  clients. This acquisition advanced our go-to-market strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide our broad array of add-on solutions. 
  Enterprise Priorities 
  We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2016 are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. 
  Industry Trends 
  The market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. The financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment, deposit, lending, investment and risk management products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, regulatory conditions have continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. In particular, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and will continue to generate, numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry. These conditions, along with mild economic improvement, have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as  digital channels.  
    17 

     Table of Contents  

   This increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. Based on these market conditions, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. Furthermore, we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients. 
  In addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. An acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system, or elects to move to one of our systems, and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected. Financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts, which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. These fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. Our revenue is diversified, and our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model, and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25% of our annual revenue. In addition, we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. 
  Acquisitions 
  We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. 
  Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets 
  We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit s last quantitative test, the extent a  
    18 

     Table of Contents  

   reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. 
  The first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets, goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. 
  Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of   2015   determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values. 
  We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. No impairment of our acquired intangible assets was identified during   2015  . 
  Revenue Recognition 
  The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. At times, however, judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition, such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables. Due to the quantity, size and nature of our multiple element arrangements, the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element. Additionally, given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 
  Results of Operations 
  Components of Revenue and Expenses 
  The following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. 
  Processing and Services 
  Processing and services revenue, which in   2015   represented 84% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. 
  Product 
  Product revenue, which in   2015   represented 16% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales which represented less than 4% of our consolidated revenue. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue.

     Table of Contents  

   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 
  Financial Results 
  In March 2013, we sold our club solutions business ( Club Solutions ). The 2013 results of operations and cash flows of Club Solutions, which were previously included within the Payments segment, have been reported as discontinued operations. 
  The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

(1) 
    Represents the basis point growth or decline in operating margin. 
     Total Revenue 
  Total revenue   increased     $188 million  , or   4%  , in   2015   and increased   $252 million  , or   5%  , in   2014   compared to the prior years. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted overall revenue growth by approximately 50 basis points in 2015. The   increase   in total revenue during   2015   was due to   4%   revenue growth in our Payments segment and   3%   revenue growth in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to   2014  . The increase in total revenue during   2014   was attributable to   8%   revenue growth in our Payments segment and   3%   revenue growth in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to   2013  .  
  Revenue in our Payments segment   increased     $115 million  , or   4%  , in   2015   and increased   $195 million  , or   8%  , in   2014   compared to the prior years. Payments segment revenue growth during   2015   and   2014   was driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue   increased     $129 million  , or   6%  , and   $128 million  , or   7%  , in   2015   and   2014  , respectively. The growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services, bill payment and digital channels businesses, as well as our biller solutions business in 2015. Product revenue   decreased     $14 million  , or   2%  , in   2015   and   increased     $67 million  , or   10%  , in   2014   compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower software license revenue as compared to the prior year, while the higher product revenue in 2014 was attributable to increased volumes including a higher level of card reissuances in our output solutions business, a portion of which is postage pass-through revenue that is included in both product revenue and cost of product. 
  Revenue in our Financial segment   increased     $76 million   in   2015   and   $58 million   in   2014  , or   3%   in each year, compared to the prior years. In both 2015 and 2014, revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased processing and services revenue in our account processing and lending businesses, including higher contract termination fee revenue. This growth was partially offset by negative foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 70 basis points and 30 basis points in 2015 and 2014,  
    21 

     Table of Contents  

   respectively, along with a revenue decline in our international business in 2014 due to the completion of several client implementations in 2013.  
  Total Expenses 
  Total expenses   increased     $87 million  , or   2%  , in   2015   compared to   2014   and   increased     $103 million  , or   3%  , in   2014   compared to   2013  . Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was   75.1%  ,   76.1%   and   78.0%   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was higher in 2013 due primarily to merger and integration expenses attributed to our acquisition of Open Solutions. 
  Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue   decreased   to   49.4%   in   2015   compared to   51.3%   in   2014   and   51.6%   in   2013  . Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both   2015   and   2014   by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, as well as by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that have benefited our overall cost structure. 
  Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was   86.7%   in   2015   compared to   84.7%   in   2014   and   89.2%   in   2013  . Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was negatively impacted in 2015 by increased expenses in our output solutions business associated with additional investments to expand our card manufacturing and personalization capacity. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue improved in 2014 due to higher merger and integration costs in 2013 resulting from the Open Solutions acquisition, including a $30 million non-cash impairment charge related to the replacement of our Acumen        account processing system with DNA, an Open Solutions account processing system. 
  Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was   19.7%  ,   19.2%   and   20.3%   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 as compared to 2014 was largely due to increased share-based compensation and incremental costs associated with data center and real estate consolidation activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was favorably impacted by reduced professional services expenses, including merger and integration costs, in 2014 as compared to 2013. 
  Operating Income and Operating Margin 
  Total operating income   increased     $101 million  , or   8%  , in   2015   and   $149 million  , or   14%  , in   2014   compared to the prior years. Total operating margin   increased   to   24.9%   in   2015   from   23.9%   in   2014   and   22.0%   in   2013  . Operating income and operating margin improvements in 2015 and 2014 were driven by scale efficiencies, expense discipline and operational effectiveness initiatives, along with lower merger and integration expenses in Corporate and Other related to the Open Solutions acquisition. 
  Operating income in our Payments segment   increased     $72 million  , or   9%  , and   increased     $66 million  , or   9%  , in   2015   and   2014  , respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were   29.3%  ,   28.0%   and   27.5%   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, improving   130   basis points in   2015   and   50   basis points in   2014  . The increases in operating income and operating margin in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in a number of our businesses, including card services. During 2015, Payments segment operating margin improvements were partially offset by increased expenses associated with additional investments in our biller and output solutions businesses, along with a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue. Operating margin in 2014 was negatively impacted by increased postage pass-through costs in our output solutions business, which are included in both revenue and expenses. 
  Operating income in our Financial segment   increased     $53 million  , or   7%  , and   increased     $28 million  , or   4%  , in   2015   and   2014  , respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margin in   2015   improved   120   basis points to   33.8%   as compared to   2014  , which improved   40   basis points to   32.6%   from   32.2%   in   2013  . Operating income and operating margin were positively impacted in both years by revenue growth, including higher contract termination fee revenue, along with operational effectiveness initiatives and scale efficiencies primarily in our account processing businesses. 
  The operating loss in Corporate and Other   increased     $24 million   in   2015   and decreased   $55 million   in   2014   compared to the prior years, primarily due to merger, integration and other cost activity. The operating loss increase in 2015 was attributable to increased costs incurred in conjunction with the achievement of our operational effectiveness objectives, including incremental costs related to data center and real estate consolidation activities. The 2014 decrease in operating loss  compared to 2013 was primarily due to reduced merger and integration costs related to the Open Solutions acquisition.  
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense   increased     $6 million  , or   4%  , in   2015   compared to   2014  , and was consistent in   2014   and   2013  . The increase in interest expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the reclassification of unamortized losses on settled cash flow hedges to interest expense related to the early extinguishment of debt. A decline in average outstanding debt during 2014 was offset by slightly higher variable interest rates as compared to 2013. 
    22 

     Table of Contents  

   Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment 
  In May 2015, we redeemed our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in 2016 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.8% senior notes due in 2017, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $85 million related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with redemption. 
  Income Tax Provision 
  Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was   35.7%   in   2015  ,   36.6%   in   2014   and   36.5%   in   2013  . The lower effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower income tax expense associated with our share of the net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses by our unconsolidated affiliate, StoneRiver. The 2014 effective income tax rate was relatively consistent with 2013 as increased deductions resulting from federal tax planning initiatives and the favorable resolution of tax matters were offset by additional income tax expense associated with our share of net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses at StoneRiver. 
  Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate 
  Our share of the income of StoneRiver was   $32 million  ,   $91 million   and   $80 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.     During 2015 and 2014, StoneRiver recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2013, completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business, resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation. Our share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was   $29 million   in   2015  ,   $87 million   in   2014   and $71 million in 2013. 
  Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing Operations 
  Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was   $2.99   in both   2015   and   2014   and   $2.44   in   2013  . Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted from our share of net transaction gains at StoneRiver of $0.07 per share in 2015 and $0.20 per share in both 2014 and 2013, and was negatively impacted in 2015 by debt extinguishment and refinancing costs of $0.25 per share and in 2013 by merger and integration costs of $0.20 per share incurred due to the acquisition of Open Solutions. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by   $0.53  ,   $0.52   and   $0.51   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  General 
  Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, our cash and cash equivalents of   $275 million   at December 31,   2015   and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The following table presents our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.

     Table of Contents  

   Our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow, was   $1.35 billion   in   2015  , an increase of   3%   compared with   $1.31 billion   in   2014  . This increase was primarily due to increased operating results, partially offset by a decrease in cash dividends received from our StoneRiver joint venture, representing returns on our investment. 
  Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately   7%   and   6%   of our total revenue in   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Capital expenditures in 2015 include $70 million related to our Atlanta facility consolidation, consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment, of which $25 million is offset by landlord reimbursements included in net changes in working capital and other. 
  In   2015   and   2014  , we received cash dividends of   $36 million   and   $110 million  , respectively, from our StoneRiver joint venture. These dividends, in their entirety, represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities. In January 2016, we received a $140 million cash dividend from StoneRiver funded from the January 2016 sale of a business interest. 
  On January 20, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with ACI Worldwide, Inc. to acquire certain assets of its Community Financial Services business in a transaction valued at $200 million, exclusive of related tax benefits.  This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2016. 
  Share Repurchases 
  We purchased $1.47 billion and $1.16 billion of our common stock in   2015   and 2014, respectively. On November 19, 2014 and November 18, 2015, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 20.0 million and 15.0 million shares, respectively, of our common stock. As of December 31,   2015  , we had approximately   17.4 million   shares remaining under these authorizations. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. 
  Indebtedness 

At December 31,   2015  , our long-term debt consisted primarily of   $3.3 billion   of senior notes,   $628 million   of term loan borrowings and   $379 million   of revolving credit facility borrowings. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during   2015  . The December 31, 2014 debt balances above have been adjusted on a retrospective basis for the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . Accordingly, debt issuance costs of   $21 million   and   $13 million   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, related to our term loan and senior notes are reported as a direct reduction of the related debt instrument.

   Revolving Credit Facility 
  In April 2015, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement that restated our existing   $2.0 billion   revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and extended its maturity from October 2018 to April 2020. The amended and restated credit agreement also provided that our subsidiaries that were guaranteeing our obligations under the revolving credit facility were released from their respective guarantees. Borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility continue to bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was   1.49%   at December 31, 2015. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The amended revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that are substantially similar to those under our previously existing credit agreement and require us, among other things, to: (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. 
  Term Loan 
  We maintain a term loan with a syndicate of banks that matures in October 2018 and bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was   1.67%   at December 31, 2015. A remaining scheduled principal payment of   $90 million   is due on December 31, 2017, with the outstanding principal balance of   $540 million   due at maturity. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above. In April 2015, we entered into an amendment to our term loan facility to conform certain of its terms to those in the amended and restated credit agreement, including providing that our subsidiaries that were guaranteeing our obligations under the term loan facility were released from their respective guarantees. 
  Senior Notes 
  In May 2015, we completed an offering of   $1.75 billion   of senior notes comprised of   $850 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.7%   senior notes due in June 2020 and   $900 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.85%   senior notes due in June 2025. The notes pay interest at the stated rates semi-annually on June 1 and December 1, which commenced on December 1, 2015. Our   4.625%   senior notes due in October 2020 and   3.5%   senior notes due in October 2022 pay interest at the stated rates on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Our   4.75%   senior notes due in June 2021 pay interest at the stated rate on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries  ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries  ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. At December 31, 2014, our   $300 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.125%   senior notes due in October 2015 were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term as we had the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so under our amended and restated revolving credit facility. In October 2015, we used our available borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility to repay the   $300 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.125%   senior notes. 
  In May 2015, we used the net proceeds from the offering described above to redeem our   $600 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.125%   senior notes due in June 2016 and   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.8%   senior notes due in November 2017. We recorded a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of   $85 million   related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with this redemption. In addition, we paid scheduled December 2015 and December 2016 principal payments on the term loan totaling   $180 million   and repaid, at that time, outstanding borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility. The remaining net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes. 
  In April 2015, we provided notice to the trustee under the indenture and supplemental indentures governing our outstanding senior notes that the subsidiary guarantors of the outstanding senior notes were automatically released from all of their obligations under the supplemental indentures and their respective guarantees. 
  Other 
  Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31,   2015  , we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody s  
    25 

     Table of Contents  

   Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody s ) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard   Poor s Ratings Services ( S P ) on our senior unsecured debt securities. 
  The interest rates payable on our senior notes, term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody s or S P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody s or S P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
  We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than letters of credit. The following table details our contractual cash obligations at December 31,   2015  : 

(1) 
    Interest, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis. 
              (2) 
    The calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, and the variable rates on the term loan and revolving credit facility are priced at the rate in effect as of December 31,   2015  . 
       Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. Our senior management actively monitors these risks. 
  We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31,   2015  , a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in   2016   by approximately   $10 million  . 
  In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. These subscriber funds are invested in short-term, highly liquid investments. Subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity. Based on daily average subscriber funds balances during   2015   of approximately   $1.1 billion  , a 1% increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pre-tax income by approximately   $10 million  , and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero, our annual pre-tax income would decrease by less than $5 million. 
  We conduct business in the United States and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately $85 million as of December 31,   2015   to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. In   2015  , approximately   6%   of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31,   2015  , there would not have been a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position.

Fiserv, Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Description of the Business 
  Fiserv, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ) provide financial services technology to clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, mutual savings banks, and building societies. The Company provides account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. The Company is principally located in the United States where it operates data and transaction processing centers, provides technology support, develops software and payment solutions, and offers consulting services. 
  The Company s operations are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products ( Payments ) segment and the Financial Institution Services ( Financial ) segment. Additional information regarding the Company s business segments is included in Note   9  . 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fiserv, Inc. and all   100%   owned subsidiaries. Investments in less than   50%   owned affiliates in which the Company has significant influence but not control are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Stock Split 
  On November 20, 2013, the Company s Board of Directors declared a   two  -for-one stock split of the Company s common stock and a proportionate increase in the number of its authorized shares of common stock. The additional shares were distributed on December 16, 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 2, 2013. The Company s common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 17, 2013. All share and per share amounts are retroactively presented on a split-adjusted basis. The impact of the stock split was an increase of   $2 million   to common stock and an offsetting reduction in additional paid-in capital, which has been retroactively restated. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ( ASU 2015-17 ), which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. For public entities, ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-17 effective December 31, 2015 on a retrospective basis. Accordingly,   $42 million   of current deferred tax assets have been reclassified to noncurrent assets and liabilities on the December 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet, which increased other long-term assets by   $26 million   and decreased noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities by   $16 million  . 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability rather than as an asset. The standard does not affect the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs; therefore, the amortization of such costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. For public entities, ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permissible for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The new guidance is to be applied on a retrospective basis to all prior periods. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 effective December 31, 2015. Accordingly,   $13 million   of debt issuance costs, previously included within other long-term assets, have been reclassified as a reduction of long-term debt on the December 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet. 
    33 

     Table of Contents  

   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ), which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements of financial instruments. For public entities, ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for certain provisions of the standard. Entities must apply the standard, with certain exceptions, using a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments   ( ASU 2015-16 ), which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments related to a business combination. The standard requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. ASU 2015-16 also requires companies to disclose the portion of the adjustment recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date, either separately in the income statement or in the notes. For public entities, ASU 2015-16 is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-16 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ), which changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. ASU 2015-02 clarifies how to determine whether equity holders as a group have power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the legal entity s economic performance and could affect whether it is a variable interest entity. For public entities, ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015; early adoption is allowed, including in any interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-02 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ), to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and to create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This model involves a five-step process for achieving that core principle, along with comprehensive disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for one year and will permit early adoption as of the original effective date in ASU 2014-09. For public entities, the standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified approach to adopt this new guidance. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company applies fair value accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in its consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value represents the amount that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
  The fair values of cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, settlement assets and obligations, and accounts payable approximate their respective carrying values due to the short period of time to maturity. The estimated fair value of debt is described in Note   5   and was estimated using quoted prices in inactive markets (level 2 of the fair value hierarchy) or using discounted cash flows based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). 
  Derivatives 
  Derivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the hedged  
    34 

     Table of Contents  

   item affects earnings. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings. To the extent the fair value hedge is effective, there is an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of hedges are recognized in earnings. The Company s policy is to enter into derivatives with creditworthy institutions and not to enter into such derivatives for speculative purposes. 
  Foreign Currency 
  Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, where the functional currency is the local currency, are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Gains and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company generates revenue from the delivery of processing, service and product solutions. Revenue is recognized when written contracts are signed, delivery has occurred, the fees are fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. 
  Processing and services revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily derived from contracts that generate account- and transaction-based fees for data processing, transaction processing, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer, debit processing services, and consulting services. Certain of the Company s revenue is generated from multiple element arrangements involving various combinations of product and service deliverables. The deliverables within these arrangements are evaluated at contract inception to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting, and if so, contract consideration is allocated to each deliverable based on relative selling price. The relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value, third-party evidence or best estimate of selling price. Revenue is then recognized in accordance with the appropriate revenue recognition guidance applicable to the respective elements. Also included in processing and services revenue is software maintenance fee revenue for ongoing client support, which is recognized ratably over the term of the applicable support period, generally   12 months  . Deferred revenue consists primarily of advance cash receipts for services and is recognized as revenue when the services are provided. 
  Product revenue is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales which represented less than   4%   of consolidated revenue. For software license agreements that do not require significant customization or modification, the Company recognizes software license revenue upon delivery, assuming persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the license fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software are accounted for under contract accounting, with revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion method based upon efforts-expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. Changes in estimates for revenues, costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable and were not material for any period presented. 
  The Company includes reimbursements from clients, such as postage and telecommunication costs, in processing and services revenue and product revenue, while the related costs are included in cost of processing and services and cost of product. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and investments with original maturities of   90   days or less. 
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  The Company analyzes the collectibility of trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, client creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in client payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. The allowance for doubtful accounts was   $11 million   at both December 31,   2015   and   2014  . 
    35 

     Table of Contents  

   Prepaid Expenses 
  Prepaid expenses represent advance payments for goods and services to be consumed in the future, such as maintenance, postage and insurance, and totaled   $146 million   and   $132 million   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.

   Goodwill 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, the Company considers the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of the reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, the Company assesses numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that the Company assesses include its share price, its financial performance, market and competitive factors in its industry, and other events specific to its reporting units. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company performs a two-step quantitative impairment test by comparing reporting unit carrying values to estimated fair values.   No   impairment was identified in the Company s annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of   2015   as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units exceeded the carrying values. In addition, there is   no   accumulated impairment loss through December 31,   2015  . The changes in goodwill during   2015   and   2014   were as follows:    

Asset Impairment 
  The Company reviews property and equipment, intangible assets and its investment in unconsolidated affiliate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company reviews capitalized software development costs for impairment at each balance sheet date. Recoverability of property and equipment, capitalized software development costs, and other intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. The Company s investment in unconsolidated affiliate is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to its estimated fair value and is impaired if any decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. 
  Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 
  Accounts payable and accrued expenses consisted of the following at December 31: 

Income Taxes 
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

  The Company has entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. As of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately   $85 million   and   $73 million  , respectively, and the fair value totaling approximately   $1 million   is reported in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31,   2015   and   2014  . 
  Net Income Per Share 
  Net income per share in each period is calculated using actual, unrounded amounts. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents consist of stock options and restricted stock units and are computed using the treasury stock method. In   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the Company excluded   0.9 million  ,   1.2 million   and   1.5 million   weighted-average shares, respectively, from the calculations of common stock equivalents for anti-dilutive stock options. 
  The computation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per share is as follows:

  Stock Plans 
  The Company recognizes the fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees in cost of processing and services, cost of product, and selling, general and administrative expense in its consolidated statements of income. 
  The Company s share-based compensation primarily consists of the following: 
  Stock Options     The Company grants stock options to employees and non-employee directors at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company s stock on the dates of grant, which are typically in the first quarter of the year. Stock options generally vest over a   three  -year period beginning on the first anniversary of the grant. All stock options expire   ten   years from the date of the award. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the stock options over the requisite service period of the stock option award. 
  Restricted Stock Units     The Company awards restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. The Company recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock units based on the market price of the common stock on the date of award over the period during which the awards vest. Restricted stock units generally vest over a   three  -year period beginning on the second anniversary of the award. 
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan     The Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of common stock each quarter through payroll deductions at   85%   of the closing price of the Company s common stock on the last business day of each calendar quarter.

At December 31,   2015  , the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost for unvested stock options and restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, of   $61 million   is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.2   years. 
  The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   was   $25.51  ,   $18.90   and   $13.00   per share, respectively. The fair values of stock options granted were estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions: 

The Company determined the expected life of stock options using historical data adjusted for known factors that could alter historical exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect as of the grant date. Expected volatility is determined using weighted-average implied market volatility combined with historical volatility. The Company believes that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than purely historical volatility.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Fiserv, Inc.: 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fiserv, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,   2015  . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fiserv, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,   2015  , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2015  , based on the criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated   February 19, 2016   expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

    Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
     Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).

    Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
     Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions. 
  Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2015  . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)  . Based on management s assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31,   2015  , our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
  Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued their attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report is included below under the heading  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  
           (c) 
    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
     There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,   2015   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Fiserv, Inc.: 
  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fiserv, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of December 31,   2015  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2015  , based on the criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,   2015   of the Company and our report dated   February 19, 2016   expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Section 6  .   Fixing of Record Date  . 
    
  (a)        The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date not less than ten days and not more than seventy days prior to the date of an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, such meeting (the  Meeting Record Date ).

The shareholders of record on the Meeting Record Date shall be the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting, Special Meeting or Demand Special Meeting. When a determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at the Annual Meeting, Special Meeting or Demand Special Meeting has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall be applied to any adjournment thereof unless the Board of Directors fixes a new Meeting Record Date and except as otherwise required by law. A new Meeting Record Date must be set if a meeting is adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty days after the date fixed for the original meeting. 
    
  (b)        The Board of Directors may also fix in advance a date as the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to take any other action or determining shareholders for any other purpose other than those set forth in Section 3(a) of this Article II and the foregoing Section 6(a). Such record date shall not be more than  
    10 

seventy days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If the Board of Directors does not fix a record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive a share dividend or distribution (other than a distribution involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the Corporation s shares), then the close of business on the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors is adopted declaring the dividend or distribution shall be the record date.

The Consent Record Date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and such date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder or shareholders of record who are seeking to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall, by sending written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation by hand or by certified registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix a Consent Record Date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such a valid request is received and verified, adopt a resolution fixing the Consent Record Date and shall make a public announcement of such Consent Record Date.

Section 7  .   List of Shareholders  . It shall be the duty of the Secretary or other officer of the Corporation who shall have charge of the stock ledger to prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of the shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each shareholder and the number of shares registered in his name. Such list shall be open to the examination of any shareholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period beginning two Business Days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing to the date of the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall be kept and produced at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and subject to the inspection of any shareholders who may be present. The original or duplicate ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or the books of the Corporation or to vote in person or by proxy at such meeting. 
    
  Section 8  .   Quorum; Postponement; Adjournments  . 
    
   (a)        Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares exists with respect to that matter. Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, these By-Laws or in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter by the voting group shall constitute a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, other than for the purpose of objecting to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of the meeting unless a new Meeting Record Date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting. 
    
  (b)        The Board of Directors acting by resolution may postpone and reschedule any previously scheduled meeting; provided, however, that a Demand Special Meeting shall not be postponed beyond the 100th day following the Delivery Date. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum, (i) at any time, upon a resolution by shareholders if the votes cast in favor of such resolution by the holders of shares of each voting group entitled to vote on any matter theretofore properly brought before the meeting exceed the number of votes cast against such resolution by the holders of shares of each such voting group or (ii) at any time prior to the transaction of any business at such meeting, by the President, the Chairman of the Board or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that a Demand Special Meeting adjourned pursuant to clause (ii) must be reconvened on or before the 100th day following the Delivery Date. No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be given except as required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. 
    14 

Section 9  .   Voting  . Every shareholder of record who is entitled to vote shall at every meeting of the shareholders be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him on the record date; except, however, that shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor counted for quorum purposes.  Nothing in this Section shall be construed as limiting the right of the Corporation to vote its own stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity.  If a quorum exists, then action on a matter, other than the election of directors, by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law requires a greater number of affirmative votes.  Each director shall be elected as provided in Section 2 of Article III.  Unless demanded by a shareholder of the Corporation present in person or by proxy at any meeting of the shareholders and entitled to vote thereat or so directed by the chairman of the meeting or required by law, the vote thereat on any question need not be by written ballot.  On a vote by written ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the shareholder voting, or in his name by his proxy, if there be such proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted by him and the number of votes to which each share is entitled. 
    
  Section 10  .   Proxies  . At any meeting, a shareholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. A shareholder entitled to vote at any meeting, or to express consent or dissent in writing to any corporate action without a meeting, may authorize another Person to act for the shareholder by appointing the Person as a proxy. The means by which a shareholder or the shareholder s authorized officer, director, employee, agent or attorney-in-fact may authorize another Person to act for the shareholder by appointing the Person as proxy include: 
    
  (a)        Appointment of a proxy in writing by signing or causing the shareholder s signature to be affixed to an appointment form by any reasonable means, including, without limitation, by facsimile signature. 
    
  (b)        Appointment of a proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission of the appointment to the Person who will be appointed as proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent authorized to receive the transmission by the Person who will be appointed as proxy. Every electronic transmission shall contain, or be accompanied by, information that can be used to reasonably determine that the shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of the electronic transmission. Any Person charged with determining whether a shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of the electronic transmission shall specify the information upon which the determination is made. 
    
  An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector of election or the officer or agent of the Corporation authorized to tabulate votes. Unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that the proxy is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest, a proxy may be revoked at any time before it is voted, either by written  
    15 

notice filed with the Secretary or the secretary of the meeting or by oral notice given by the shareholder to the presiding officer during the meeting. The presence of a shareholder who has made an effective proxy appointment shall not of itself constitute a revocation. A proxy appointment is valid for eleven months unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment. The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board and the President each shall have the power and authority to make rules as to the validity and sufficiency of proxies. 
    
  Section 11  .   Action without a Meeting  . 
    
  (a)        Any action required to be taken at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting or any action which may be taken at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those shareholders who have not consented in writing. 
    
  (b)        To be valid, each expression of consent to corporate action in writing (a  Consent ) shall be in writing; shall set forth the specific corporate action to be taken (which corporate action or actions shall be limited to the action or actions set forth in the written request to set a Consent Record Date received by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II); shall be signed by one or more Persons who as of the Consent Record Date are shareholders of record (or their duly authorized proxies); shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder (or their duly authorized proxies); shall set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation s books, of each shareholder signing such Consent and the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned of record by each such shareholder; in the case of a Person who is not a shareholder of record, shall be accompanied by a proxy or proxies evidencing each such Person s appointment as a proxy for the applicable shareholder of record; and shall be sent to the inspectors of elections engaged by the Corporation pursuant to the following Section 11(d) in accordance with the provisions of the following Section 11(e). Without limiting the foregoing, no Consent shall be valid unless, within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, Consents representing the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate action are delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11; provided, however, that if the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder (whichever is soliciting Consents) has requested a Preliminary Consent Report that is pending on such 70th day pursuant to the following Section 11(f), then such Consents shall be valid if Consents representing the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate action are delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11 at such time as such inspectors issue the Final Consent Report relating to the pending Preliminary Consent Report pursuant to the following Section 11(g) or Section 11(h). The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the  
    16 

President shall have the power and authority to make rules that are not inconsistent with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law as to the validity of Consents and revocations thereof. 
    
  (c)        Consents may be revoked at any time prior to the earlier of (i) such time as the inspectors of elections issue a Final Consent Report pursuant to the following Section 11(g) or Section 11(h) or (ii) seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II by written notice delivered to (A) the Secretary, (B) any Consent Soliciting Shareholder, (C) to a proxy solicitor or other agent designated by the Corporation or any Consent Soliciting Shareholder and/or (D) the inspectors of elections engaged by the Corporation pursuant to the following Section 11(d). 
    
  (d)        Within three Business Days after a Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, the Corporation shall (i) engage regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of Consents and revocations thereof and (ii) provide notice to each Consent Soliciting Shareholder of the identity of such inspectors and the manner in which such Consent Soliciting Shareholder may deliver Consents and revocations thereof to such inspectors pursuant to the following Section 11(e). Except as provided in Section 6(c)(ii) of this Article II, the cost of retaining inspectors of election shall be borne by the Corporation. 
    
  (e)        The Corporation, the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and their respective proxy solicitors or other designated agents shall deliver Consents and revocations thereof to the inspectors within two Business Days after receipt. As soon as the inspectors receive Consents and/or revocations thereof, the inspectors shall review the Consents and revocations thereof and shall maintain a count of the number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents. The inspectors shall keep such count confidential and shall not reveal the count to any Person; provided, however, that, as soon as practicable after a written request therefor by the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder, the inspectors shall issue a report (a  Consent Report ) to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders stating: (i) the number of shares subject to valid Consents; (ii) the number of shares subject to valid revocations of Consents; (iii) the number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents; (iv) the number of shares subject to invalid Consents; (v) the number of shares subject to invalid revocations of Consents; (vi) whether, based on their count, the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents has been obtained to express the corporate action specified in the Consents; and (vii) the latest date the inspectors received Consents and revocations thereof that the inspectors reflected in such report (the  Report Date ). 
    
  (f)        As soon as practicable after a written request therefor by the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder (whichever is soliciting Consents), notice of which request shall be given to the Corporation and any parties opposing the solicitation of Consents, if any, which request shall state that the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, as the case may be, have a good faith belief that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified  
    17 

in the Consents has been received in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and these By-Laws, the inspectors shall issue and deliver to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders a preliminary Consent Report (the  Preliminary Consent Report  provided, however, that neither the Corporation nor the Consent Soliciting Shareholders may request a Preliminary Consent Report after the 70th day after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II. Unless the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall agree to a shorter or longer period, the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall have two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report to review the Consents and revocations thereof and to advise the inspectors and the opposing parties in writing as to whether they intend to challenge the Preliminary Consent Report. 
    
  (g)        If no written notice of an intention to challenge a Preliminary Consent Report is received within two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report by the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and either (i) the date that is two Business Days after such receipt of such Preliminary Consent Report (the  Cut-Off Date ) is more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II or (ii) the Cut-Off Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders their final Consent Report (a  Final Consent Report ), which shall contain the information included in the Preliminary Consent Report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of Consents and revocations thereof received after the Preliminary Consent Report Report Date to the time of issuance of the Final Consent Report, if such Consents and revocations thereof are received within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, and a certification as to whether the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained. If the Cut-Off Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number or shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue a Consent Report to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and a certification that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting Consents) shall have the right to request again a Preliminary Consent Report in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing Section 11(f). 
    
  (h)        If the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders issue written notice to the inspectors and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, as the case may be, of an intention to challenge a Preliminary Consent Report within two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report by the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, then a challenge session shall be scheduled by the  
    18 

inspectors as promptly as practicable, at which the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall have the right to object to the validity of Consents and revocations thereof. A transcript of the challenge session shall be recorded by a certified court reporter. Following completion of the challenge session, if either (i) the date on which the challenge session is completed (the  Completion Date ) is more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II or (ii) the Completion Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders a Final Consent Report, which shall contain the information included in the Preliminary Consent Report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of the challenge and, if such Consents and revocations thereof are received within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, Consents and revocations thereof received after the Preliminary Consent Report Report Date to the time of issuance of the Final Report, and a certification as to whether the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained. If the Completion Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue a Consent Report to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and a certification that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting Consents) shall have the right to request again a Preliminary Consent Report in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing Section 11(f). 
    
  (j)        Simultaneously with the delivery of any Final Consent Report to the Corporation pursuant to the foregoing Section 11(g) or Section 11(4), the inspectors shall deliver all valid and unrevoked Consents to the Corporation, which shall constitute delivery of such Consents to the Corporation for purposes of Section 180.0704 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law and the Articles of Incorporation. A copy of any Final Consent Report shall be included in the book in which the proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. 
    
  (k)        As to any Consent, if, prior to the issuance of a Final Consent Report and delivery of Consents to the Corporation, all Consent Soliciting Shareholders notify the Corporation and the inspectors in writing that such Consent Soliciting Shareholders no longer desire to express consent to the corporate actions specified in the Consents, then the Consents shall be deemed abandoned, and the inspectors shall not issue a Final Consent Report or deliver such Consents to the Corporation. 
    
  Section 12  .   Acceptance of Instruments Showing Shareholder Action  . If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of a  
    19 

shareholder, the Corporation, acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of a shareholder. If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of a shareholder, the Corporation, acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the shareholder if any of the following apply:

The Maximum Number for a particular Annual Meeting shall be reduced by (A) Nominees nominated by a Nominating Shareholder for that Annual Meeting whose nomination is subsequently withdrawn after the Nominating Shareholder is notified by the Corporation that the Nominees will be included in the Corporation s proxy statement and proxy card for the Annual Meeting, (B) Nominees nominated by a Nominating Shareholder for such Annual Meeting pursuant to this Section 14 that the Board of Directors itself decides to nominate for election at such Annual Meeting and (C) the number of directors in office as of the Final Nomination Date who had been Nominees nominated by a Nominating Shareholder with respect to any of the preceding two Annual Meetings (including any Nominee who had been counted at any such Annual Meeting pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (B)) and whose reelection at the upcoming Annual Meeting is being recommended by the Board of Directors.  If one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the Final Nomination Date but before the date of the Annual Meeting and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection with the occurrence of the vacancy or vacancies, then the Maximum Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. 
  (ii)        Any Nominating Holder submitting more than one Nominee pursuant to this Section 14 for an Annual Meeting shall rank such Nominees based on the order in which the Nominating Holder desires such Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy statement for such Annual Meeting if the number of Nominees pursuant to this Section 14 exceeds the Maximum Number.  If the number of Nominees pursuant to this Section 14 for any Annual Meeting exceeds the Maximum Number, then the highest ranking Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section 14 from each Nominating Holder will be selected for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy statement until the Maximum Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of the shares of common stock of the Corporation disclosed as owned in each Nominating Shareholder s Nomination Notice.   
  (iii)        If, after the Final Nomination Date, (A) the Corporation is notified, or the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, determines that (1) a Nominating Shareholder has failed to satisfy or to continue to satisfy the eligibility requirements described in Section 14(c), (2) any of the representations and warranties made in the Nomination Notice cease to be true and accurate in all material respects (or omit a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading) or (3) any material violation or breach occurs of the obligations, agreements, representations or warranties of the Nominating Shareholder or the Nominee under this Section 14, (B) a Nominating Shareholder or any qualified representative thereof does not appear at the Annual Meeting to present any nomination submitted pursuant to this Section 14, or the  
    22 

Nominating Shareholder withdraws its nomination, or (C) a Nominee becomes ineligible for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy statement pursuant to this Section 14 or dies, becomes disabled or is otherwise disqualified from being nominated for election or serving as a director of the Corporation or is unwilling or unable to serve as a director of the Corporation, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, whether before or after the Corporation s definitive proxy statement for such Annual Meeting is made available to shareholders, then the nomination of the Nominating Shareholder or such Nominee, as the case may be, shall be disregarded and no vote on such Nominee will occur (notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation), the Nominating Shareholder may not cure in any way any defect preventing the nomination of the Nominee, and the Corporation (1) may omit from its proxy statement and any ballot or form of proxy the disregarded Nominee and any information concerning such Nominee (including a Nominating Shareholder s statement in support) or any successor or replacement nominee proposed by the Nominating Shareholder or by any other Nominating Shareholder and (2) may otherwise communicate to its shareholders, including without limitation by amending or supplementing its proxy statement or ballot or form of proxy, that the Nominee will not be included as a Nominee in the proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy and will not be voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
  (c)        Eligibility of Nominating Shareholder  . 
  (i)        An  Eligible Holder  is a person who has either (A) been a record holder of the shares of the Corporation s common stock used to satisfy the eligibility requirements in this Section 14(c) continuously for the three-year period specified in Section 14(c)(ii) or (B) provides to the Secretary of the Corporation, within the time period referred to in Section 14(d), evidence of continuous ownership of such shares for such three-year period from one or more securities intermediaries in a form and in substance that the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, determines would be deemed acceptable for purposes of a shareholder proposal under Rule 14a-8(b)(2) under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule). 
  (ii)        An Eligible Holder or group of up to 20 Eligible Holders may submit a nomination in accordance with this Section 14 only if the person or group (in the aggregate) has continuously owned at least the Minimum Number (as defined below) of shares of the Corporation s common stock throughout the three-year period preceding and including the date of submission of the Nomination Notice and continues to own at least the Minimum Number through the date of the Annual Meeting.  A group of funds under common management and investment control shall be treated as one Eligible Holder for purposes of such limitation if such Eligible Holder shall provide together with the Nomination Notice documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation that demonstrates that the funds are under common management and investment control.  For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a nomination by a group of Eligible Holders, any and all requirements and obligations applicable to an individual Eligible Holder that are set forth in this Section 14, including the minimum holding period, shall apply to each member of such group; provided, however, that the Minimum Number shall apply to the ownership of the group in the aggregate, and a breach of any obligation, agreement,  
    23 

representation or warranty under this Section 14 by any member of a group shall be deemed a breach by the Nominating Shareholder.  If any shareholder withdraws from a group of Eligible Holders at any time prior to the Annual Meeting, then the group of Eligible Shareholders shall only be deemed to own the shares held by the remaining members of the group and if, as a result of such withdrawal, the Nominating Shareholder no longer owns the Minimum Number of shares of the Corporation s common stock, then the nomination shall be disregarded as provided in Section 14(b)(iii). 
  (iii)        The  Minimum Number  of shares of the Corporation s common stock means 3% of the number of outstanding shares of the Corporation s common stock as of the most recent date for which such amount is given in any filing by the Corporation with the SEC prior to the submission of the Nomination Notice. 
  (iv)        For purposes of this Section 14, an Eligible Holder  owns  only those outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation as to which the Eligible Holder possesses both: 
  (A)        the full voting and investment rights pertaining to such shares; and 
  (B)        the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares; 
  provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) shall not include any shares (1) sold by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (2) borrowed by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates for any purpose or purchased by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell or (3) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar instrument or agreement entered into by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (x) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such Eligible Holder s or any of its affiliates  full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares and/or (y) hedging, offsetting, or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from maintaining the full economic ownership of such shares by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates.  An Eligible Holder  owns  shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the Eligible Holder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares.  An Eligible Holder s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Holder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other similar instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the Eligible Holder.  An Eligible Holder s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Holder has loaned such shares provided that the Eligible Holder has the power to recall such loaned shares on five business days  notice, recalls such loaned shares upon being notified by the Corporation that any of the Eligible  
    24 

Holder s Nominees will be included in the Corporation s proxy statement and proxy card for the Annual Meeting (subject to the provisions of this Section 14) and holds such shares through the date of the Annual Meeting.  The terms  owned,   owning,   ownership  and other variations of the word  own  shall have correlative meanings.  Whether outstanding shares of the Corporation are  owned  for these purposes shall be determined by the Board.  For purposes of this Section 14, the term  affiliate  or  affiliates  shall have the meaning ascribed thereto under the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act. 
  (v)        No person shall be permitted to be in more than one group constituting a Nominating Shareholder, and if any person appears as a member of more than one group, then it shall be deemed to be a member of the group that has the largest amount of shares of common stock of the Corporation disclosed as owned in the Nomination Notice. 
  (d)        Nomination Notice  .  To nominate a Nominee for purposes of this Section 14, the Nominating Shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary.  To be timely, a Nominating Shareholder s notice shall be received by the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the first annual anniversary of the date set forth in the Corporation s proxy statement for the immediately preceding Annual Meeting as the date on which the Corporation first made available to its shareholders definitive proxy materials for the immediately preceding Annual Meeting; provided, however, that if the date for which the Annual Meeting is called is more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after the first annual anniversary of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting, then notice by the Nominating Shareholder to be timely must be received by the Secretary by the later of the close of business on the date that is 180 days prior to the date of such Annual Meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of such Annual Meeting is first made.  In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of any Annual Meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a Nomination Notice. To be in proper form, a Nominating Shareholder s notice to the Secretary for purposes of this Section 14 shall include all of the following information and documents (collectively, the  Nomination Notice ):  
  (i)        A Schedule 14N (or any successor form) relating to the Nominee, completed and filed with the SEC by the Nominating Shareholder as applicable, in accordance with SEC rules; 
  (ii)        A written notice of the nomination of such Nominee that includes the following additional information, agreements, representations and warranties by the Nominating Shareholder (including each group member):

  (H)        a representation and warranty that the Nominating Shareholder will not engage in, and will not be a  participant  in another person s,  solicitation  within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act (without reference to the exception in Rule 14a-1(l)(2)(iv)) (or any successor rules) with respect to the Annual Meeting, other than with respect to its Nominees or any nominees of the Board of Directors; 
  (I)        a representation and warranty that the Nominating Shareholder will not use any proxy card other than the Corporation s proxy card in soliciting shareholders in connection with the election of a Nominee at the Annual Meeting;

    27 

(C)        to assume all liability (jointly and severally by all group members in the case of a nomination by a group) stemming from any action, suit or proceeding concerning any actual or alleged legal or regulatory violation arising out of any communication by the Nominating Shareholder, its affiliates and associates or their respective agents and representatives with the Corporation, its shareholders or any other person in connection with the nomination or election of directors, including without limitation the Nomination Notice, or out of the facts, statements or other information that the Nominating Shareholder or its Nominees provided to the Corporation in connection with the inclusion of such Nominees in the Corporation s proxy statement;

  ARTICLE III 
    
  BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
    
  Section 1  .   Powers  . The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. 
    
  Section 2  .   Election and Term  .  
    
  (a)        The Board of Directors shall be elected for terms as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation.  Acceptance of the office of Director may be expressed orally or in writing, and attendance at a meeting shall constitute such acceptance. 
    
  (b)        Except as provided in this Section 2, each Director shall be elected by the majority of the votes cast with respect to that Director s election at any meeting of shareholders for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present and the election is not a Contested Election.  For purposes of this Section 2, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast  for  a Director s election exceeds the number of votes cast  withheld  with respect to that Director s election.  Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast with respect to that Director s election.  If at the close of the notice periods set forth in Sections 5 and 14 of Article II or upon the Corporation s receipt of demands sufficient to require the calling of a Demand Special Meeting under Section 3(c) of Article II, the Chairman of the Board determines that the number of persons properly nominated to serve as Directors of the Corporation exceeds the number of Directors to be elected (a  Contested Election ), each Director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes  
    30 

cast with respect to that Director s election at the meeting at which a quorum is present regardless of whether a Contested Election shall continue to exist as of the date of such meeting. 
    
  (c)        In an election of Directors that is not a Contested Election, any nominee who was an incumbent Director whose term would otherwise have expired at the time of the election if a successor had been elected who receives a number of votes cast  for  his or her election less than the number of votes cast  withheld  with respect to his or her election (a  Majority Against Vote ) will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board following certification of the shareholder vote.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors will promptly consider the resignation submitted by such director, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept the tendered resignation or to reject it.  In considering whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, including, without limitation, the stated reasons why shareholders  withheld  votes for election from such Director, the length of service and qualifications of the Director whose resignation has been tendered and the Director s contributions to the Corporation.  The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee s recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the meeting of shareholders at which the election occurred.  In considering the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee s recommendation, the Board of Directors will consider the factors considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and such additional information and factors the Board of Directors believes to be relevant.  Following the Board of Directors  decision, the Corporation will promptly publicly disclose in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC the Board of Directors  decision whether to accept the resignation as tendered, including a full explanation of the process by which the decision was reached and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation.  Any Director who tenders a resignation pursuant to this provision will not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board of Directors consideration regarding whether or not to accept the tendered resignation.  If a majority of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee received Majority Against Votes at the same election, then the independent Directors who are on the Board of Directors who did not receive Majority Against Votes or who were not standing for election will appoint a committee of the Board of Directors among themselves for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations and will recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject them.  This committee of the Board of Directors may, but need not, consist of all of the independent Directors who did not receive Majority Against Votes or who were not standing for election. 
    
  (d)        If a Director s resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 2, or if a nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent Director whose term would otherwise have expired at the time of the election if a successor had been elected, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy  
    31 

pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 of Article III of these By-Laws or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of Article III of these By-Laws. 
    
  Section 3  .   Number  . The number of Directors shall be such number as shall be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors but shall not be less than three nor more than eleven. 
    
  Section 4  .   Tenure and Qualifications  . Each Director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders in the year in which such Director s term expires and until his successor shall have been elected, or until his prior death, resignation or removal for cause only. A Director may be removed from office for cause only by the shareholders at an annual meeting or a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose if the number of votes cast to remove such Director exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove such Director, and any vacancy so created may be filled by the shareholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to filling such vacancy.  Directors need not be residents of the State of Wisconsin or shareholders of the Corporation. 
    
  Section 5  .   Nominations for Election to the Board of Directors  . Nominations for elections to the Board of Directors may be made by the Board of Directors or by any shareholder of any outstanding class of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote for election of Directors at a meeting of shareholders in accordance with Sections 5 or 14 of Article II. 
    
  Section 6  .   Quorum and Manner of Acting  . Unless otherwise provided by law, the presence of fifty-one percent (51%) of the whole Board of Directors shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given. At all meetings of Directors, a quorum being present, all matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the majority of the Directors present, except as otherwise required by law. The Board of Directors may hold its meetings at such place or places within or without the State of Wisconsin as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or as shall be specified in the respective notices, or waivers of notice, thereof. 
    
  Section 7  .   Organization Meeting  . Immediately after each annual meeting of shareholders for the election of Directors the Board of Directors shall meet at the place of the annual meeting of shareholders for the purpose of organization, the election of officers and the transaction of other business. Notice of such meeting need not be given. If such meeting is held at any other time or place, notice thereof must be given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board of Directors, subject to a waiver of such notice, in the manner set forth in Section 180.0823 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, by all Directors who may not have received such notice. 
    
  Section 8  .   Regular Meetings  . Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Wisconsin, as shall from time to time  
    32 

be determined by the Board of Directors. After there has been such determination, and notice thereof has been once given to each member of the Board of Directors as hereinafter provided for special meetings, regular meetings may be held without further notice being given. 
    
  Section 9  .   Special Meetings; Notice  . Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or by a majority of the Directors. Notice of each such meeting shall be mailed to each Director, addressed to him at his residence or usual place of business, at least five days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, or shall be sent to him at such place by telegraph, cable, radio or wireless, or be delivered personally or by telephone, not later than the day before the day on which such meeting is to be held. Each such notice shall state the time and place of the meeting and, as may be required, the purposes thereof. Notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given to any Director if he shall sign a written waiver thereof either before or after the time stated therein for such meeting, or if he shall be present at the meeting.

Such restriction shall be in effect for such period of time following the date of the final prospectus for the offering as may be determined by the Company.
