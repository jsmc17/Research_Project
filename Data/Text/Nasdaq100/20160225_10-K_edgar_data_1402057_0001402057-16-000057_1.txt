    Item 1. Business 
  Our Company 
  CDW Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company ,  CDW  or  we ) is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ( IT ) solutions in North America and the United Kingdom. We help our customer base of over   250,000   small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers by delivering critical solutions to their increasingly complex IT needs. Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration. We are technology  agnostic,  with a product portfolio including more than   100,000   products from more than   1,000   brands. We provide our products and solutions through more than   5,000   customer-facing coworkers, including field sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers. 
  We are a leading sales channel partner in North America and the United Kingdom for many original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) and software publishers (collectively, our  vendor partners ), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. We believe we are an important extension of our vendor partners  sales and marketing capabilities, providing them with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage and extensive customer access. 
  We provide value to our customers by simplifying the complexities of technology across design, selection, procurement, integration and management.

We seek to achieve this goal by providing our customers with superior service through our large and experienced sales force and service delivery teams. Our multi-brand offering approach enables us to identify the products or combination of products that best address each customer s specific organizational IT requirements and to evolve our offerings as new technologies develop.  
  We believe we offer the following value proposition to our customers and our vendor partners:

  History 
  Founded in 1984, CDW became a public company in 1993. We were a public company from 1993 until October 2007 (see below). In 2003, we purchased selected United States assets and the Canadian operations of Micro Warehouse, which extended our growth platform into Canada. In 2006, we acquired Berbee Information Networks Corporation, a regional provider of technology products, solutions and customized engineering services in advanced technologies primarily across Cisco, IBM and Microsoft portfolios. This acquisition increased our capabilities in customized engineering services and managed services. 
  On October 12, 2007, CDW Corporation, an Illinois corporation, was acquired through a merger transaction by an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC ( Madison Dearborn ) and Providence Equity Partners L.L.C. ( Providence Equity ). CDW Corporation continued as the surviving corporation and same legal entity after the acquisition, but became a wholly owned subsidiary of VH Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 
  On December 31, 2009, CDW Corporation merged into CDWC LLC, an Illinois limited liability company owned by VH Holdings, Inc., with CDWC LLC as the surviving entity. This change had no impact on our operations or management. On December 31, 2009, CDWC LLC was renamed CDW LLC ( CDW LLC ). On August 17, 2010, VH Holdings, Inc. was renamed CDW Corporation ( Parent ), a Delaware corporation. 
  Prior to July 2, 2013, the date of our initial public offering ( IPO ), Parent was owned directly by CDW Holdings LLC ("CDW Holdings"), a company controlled by investment funds affiliated with Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity, certain other co-investors and certain members of CDW management. Before the IPO, Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity owned 46.0% and 40.6% of our common stock, respectively. After the IPO and through subsequent secondary offerings from the fourth quarter of 2013 through 2015, their ownership has significantly decreased. As of December 31, 2015, Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity own   4.9%   and   4.3%   of our common stock, respectively.  
   On July 2, 2013, Parent completed the IPO of its common stock. In connection with the IPO, CDW Holdings distributed all of its shares of Parent s common stock to its members in June 2013 in accordance with the members  respective membership interests and was subsequently dissolved in August 2013. See   Note 10     (Stockholders  Equity)   to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  for additional discussion of the IPO. 
  On November 10, 2014, we completed the acquisition of a 35% non-controlling equity interest in Kelway TopCo Limited ( Kelway ), a U.K.-based IT solutions provider, which has global supply chain relationships that enable it to conduct business in more than 80 countries. On August 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kelway by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. The acquisition enhances our ability to provide IT solutions to U.S.-based customers with international locations. We included the financial results of Kelway in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. For further details regarding the acquisition, see   Note 3     (Acquisition)   to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
  Our Market 
  We operate in the United States, United Kingdom and Canadian IT markets, which are large and growing markets. We also have an international presence in both private and public sector IT, and through our global supply chain have the ability to provide products and services in over 80 countries. According to the International Data Corporation ( IDC ), the total U.S., U.K. and Canadian IT market generated approximately   $900 billion   in sales in   2015  . We believe our addressable market in the indirect sales channel for the U.S., U.K. and Canadian markets represent more than   $282 billion   in annual sales. For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , our total Net sales of $12.9 billion represented approximately 5% of that highly diverse and fragmented market. New technologies, including cloud, virtualization and mobility, coupled with the resulting increase in demand for data as  
     5 

     Table of Contents  

   well as aging infrastructure, are increasingly requiring businesses and institutions to seek integrated solutions to their IT needs. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future, with end-user demand for business efficiency and productivity driving future IT spending growth. 
  Our Offerings 
  Our offerings range from discrete hardware and software products and services to complex integrated solutions including one or more of these elements. We believe our customers increasingly view technology purchases as integrated solutions rather than discrete product and service categories. We estimate t  hat approximately 48% of   our net sales in   2015   in the U.S. came from sales of product categories and services typically associated with solutions. Our hardware products include notebooks/mobile devices (including tablets), network communications, enterprise and data storage, video monitors, printers, desktop computers and servers. Our software products include application suites, security, virtualization, operating systems, network management and Software as a Service ( SaaS ) offerings. We also provide a full suite of value-added-services, which range from basic installation, warranty and repair services to custom configuration, data center and network implementation services, as well as managed services that include Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) offerings.  
  We also offer a variety of integrated solutions, such as: 
             
    Mobility  : We assist our customers with the selection, procurement and integration of mobile security software, hardware devices, such as smartphones, tablets and notebooks, and cellular wireless activation systems. We also provide mobile device management applications with policy and security management capabilities across a variety of mobile operating systems and platforms. 
                
    Security  : We assess our customers  security needs and provide them with threat prevention tools in order to protect their networks, servers and applications such as, anti-virus, anti-spam, content filtering, intrusion prevention, firewall and virtual private network services, and network access control. We also design and implement data loss prevention solutions, using data monitoring and encryption across a wide array of devices to ensure the security of customer information, personal employee information and research and development data.  
                
    Data Center Optimization  : We help our customers evaluate their data centers for convergence and optimization opportunities. Our data center optimization solutions consist of server virtualization, physical server consolidation, data storage management and energy-efficient power and cooling systems.  
                
    Cloud Computing  : We provide our customers with a broad portfolio of cloud-based solutions, which are technology delivered as a service. Our cloud offerings include: IaaS, which delivers compute, networking, storage, and data center capabilities via the cloud; SaaS, which connects users to cloud-based software applications; and Platform as a Service ( PaaS ), which enables development and ongoing maintenance of cloud-based solutions. We provide public cloud solutions which reside off customer premises on a public (shared) infrastructure, and private cloud solutions, which reside on customer premises. We also offer hybrid cloud solutions that deliver the benefits of both public and private solutions. Our migration, integration and managed services offerings help our customers simplify cloud adoption, as well as the ongoing management of cloud solutions across the entire IT lifecycle. Dedicated Cloud Client Executives work with our customers to architect cloud solutions meeting their organizational, technology and financial objectives. 
                
    Virtualization  : We design and implement server, storage and desktop virtualization solutions. Virtualization enables our customers to efficiently utilize hardware resources by running multiple, independent, virtual operating systems on a single computer and multiple virtual servers simultaneously on a single server. Virtualization also can separate a desktop environment and associated application software from the hardware device that is used to access it, and provides employees with remote desktop access. Our specialists assist customers with the steps of implementing virtualization solutions, including evaluating network environments, deploying shared storage options and licensing platform software. 
                
    Collaboration  : We provide our customers with communication tools allowing employees to share knowledge, ideas and information among each other and with clients and partners effectively and quickly. Our collaboration solutions unite communications and applications via the integration of products that facilitate the use of multiple enterprise communication methods including email, instant messaging, presence, social media, voice, video, hardware, software and services. We also host cloud-based collaboration solutions.

   Although we believe customers increasingly view technology purchases as solutions rather than discrete product and service categories, our net sales by major category, based upon our internal category classifications is as follow:  

(1) 
    Amounts have been reclassified for changes in individual product classifications to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
              (2) 
    The decline in software as a percentage of total net sales is primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue recorded on a net basis, including SaaS. 
              (3) 
    Includes items such as delivery charges to customers and certain commission revenue. 
     Our Customers 
  We provide integrated IT solutions to over   250,000   small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers throughout North America and the United Kingdom. As a result of the acquisition of Kelway, we also have the ability to provide products and services to customers in over 80 countries.  
  Inventory Management 
  We utilize our IT systems to manage our inventory in a cost-efficient manner, resulting in a rapid-turn inventory model. We generally only stock items that have attained a minimum sales volume.  
  Our distribution process is highly automated. Once a customer order is received and credit approved, orders are automatically routed to one of our distribution centers for picking and shipping as well as configuration and imaging services. We operate two distribution centers in North America: a 450,000 square foot facility in Vernon Hills, Illinois, and a 513,000 square foot facility in North Las Vegas, Nevada. We ship over   37 million   units annually on an aggregate basis from these two distribution centers. We believe that the location of these distribution centers allows us to efficiently ship products throughout North America and provide timely access to our principal distributors. In addition, in the event of weather-related or other disruptions at one of our distribution centers, we are able to shift order processing and fulfillment from one center to the other quickly and efficiently, enabling us to continue to ship products in a timely manner. We believe competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of the product categories we offer. We continue to improve the productivity of our distribution centers as measured by key performance indicators such as units shipped per hour worked and bin accuracy. We also operate one distribution center in the United Kingdom, a 120,000 square foot facility in Rugby. We ship over 2 million units annually from this distribution center to customers in the United Kingdom and in   more than 80 countries   around the world.  
  We also have drop-shipment arrangements with many of our OEMs and wholesale distributors, which permit us to offer products to our customers without having to take physical delivery at our distribution centers. These arrangements generally represent approximately   45% to 55%   of total consolidated net sales, including approximately   15% to 20%   related to electronic delivery for software licenses. 
  Information Technology Systems 
  We maintain customized IT and unified communication systems that enhance our ability to provide prompt, efficient and expert service to our customers. In addition, these systems enable centralized management of key functions, including purchasing, inventory management, billing and collection of accounts receivable, sales and distribution. Our systems provide us with thorough,  
     7 

     Table of Contents  

   detailed and real-time information regarding key aspects of our business. This capability helps us to continuously enhance productivity, ship customer orders quickly and efficiently, respond appropriately to industry changes and provide high levels of customer service. We believe our websites, which provide electronic order processing and advanced tools, such as, order tracking, reporting and asset management, make it easy for customers to transact business with us and ultimately strengthen our customer relationships. 
  Product Procurement 
  We may purchase all or only some of the products our vendor partners offer for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer. Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as, purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. In late 2015 we expanded our partnership with Dell. Through this partnership we have increased our offering of Dell products and services to our customers. We also purchase software from major software publishers for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer. Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. 
  In addition to purchasing products directly from our vendor partners, we purchase products from wholesale distributors for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer. These wholesale distributors provide logistics management and supply-chain services for us, as well as for our vendor partners. 
  For our North American operations, we purchased approximately   50%   of the products we sold as discrete products or as components of a solution directly from our vendor partners and the remaining 50% from wholesale distributors for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Purchases from our three largest wholesale distributors, Tech Data, SYNNEX and Ingram Micro, represented   9%  ,   9%   and   8%   of our total purchases.  
  Sales of products manufactured by Apple, Cisco, EMC, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Microsoft, whether purchased directly from these vendor partners or from a wholesale distributor, represented in the aggregate   56%   of our consolidated Net sales in   2015  . Sales of products manufactured by Cisco and the companies formerly known as Hewlett-Packard Company represented   16%   and   18%  , of our   2015   consolidated Net sales, respectively. 
  Competition 
  The market for technology products and services is highly competitive. Competition is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, quality and breadth of product and service offerings, knowledge and expertise of sales force, customer service, price, product availability, speed of delivery and credit availability. Our competition includes: 
             
    resellers, such as, Computacenter, Dimension Data, ePlus, Insight Enterprises, PC Connection, PCM, Presidio, SCC, Softchoice, World Wide Technology, and many smaller resellers; 
                
    manufacturers who sell directly to customers, such as, Dell, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Apple;  
                
    large service providers and system integrators, such as, IBM, Accenture, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell; 
                
    e-tailers, such as, Amazon, Newegg, and TigerDirect.com; 
                
    cloud providers, such as, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Box; and 
                
    retailers (including their e-commerce activities) such as Staples and Office Depot. 
     We expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed. While innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell, it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors. For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see Item 1A,  Risk Factors.  
  Marketing 
  We market the CDW brand to U.S., Canadian, and British audiences using a variety of channels that include online, broadcast, print, social and other media. This promotion is supported by integrated communication efforts targeting decision-makers, influencers and the general public using a combination of news releases, case studies, media interviews and speaking opportunities. We also market to current and prospective customers through integrated marketing programs including behaviorally targeted email, print, online media, events and sponsorships, as well as broadcast media.  
  As a result of our relationships with our vendor partners, a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs. These programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are  
     8 

     Table of Contents  

   typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time. We believe that our national scale and analytical techniques that measure the efficacy of our marketing programs differentiate us from our competitors. 
  Coworkers 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , we employed   8,465   coworkers, none of whom is covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our coworker relations to be good. 
  Intellectual Property 
  The CDW trademark and certain variations thereon are registered or subject to pending trademark applications in the U.S., Canada and certain other jurisdictions. The Kelway trademark and certain variations thereon are registered or subject to pending trademark applications in the European Union, which includes the United Kingdom, and certain other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Africa. We believe our trademarks have significant value and are important factors in our marketing programs. In addition, we own registrations for domain names, including cdw.com and cdwg.com, kelway.com and variations thereon, for certain of our primary trademarks. We also have unregistered copyrights in our website content.

    Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  There are many factors that affect our business, results of operations and cash flows, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of some important factors that may cause our actual results of operations and cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. 
  Risks Related to Our Business 
  General economic conditions could negatively affect technology spending by our customers and put downward pressure on prices, which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Weak economic conditions generally, sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions, government spending cuts and the impact of new government programs, or a tightening of credit markets, could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public sector customers.  
  Our sales to our public sector customers are impacted by government spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels. An adverse change in government spending policies (including ongoing budget cuts at the federal level), budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public sector customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. For example, in 2013, as a result of sequestration and related budget uncertainty and the partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government for 16 days, we experienced significantly reduced U.S. Federal sales in our Public segment. 
  Our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products. 
  We purchase products for resale from vendor partners, which include OEMs and software publishers, and wholesale distributors. For the year ended December 31,   2015  , we purchased approximately   50%   of the products we sold directly from vendor partners and the remaining amount from wholesale distributors for our North American Operations. We are authorized by vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities. Our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions, product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding, including purchase rebates, sales volume rebates, purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements. However, we do not have any long-term contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party. A reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business, results  
     9 

     Table of Contents  

   of operations or cash flows. In addition, a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for, and the cost of, working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows, particularly given our substantial indebtedness.  
  From time to time, vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us. For example, there is no assurance that, as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers, they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us. Any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or cash flows.  
  Although we purchase from a diverse vendor base, in   2015  , products we purchased from wholesale distributors Tech Data and SYNNEX each represented   9%   of our total purchases and Ingram Micro represented   8%   of our total North American purchases. In addition, sales of products manufactured by Apple, Cisco, EMC, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Microsoft in the aggregate represented   56%   of our   2015   Net sales. Sales of products manufactured by Cisco and the companies formerly known as Hewlett-Packard Company represented   16%   and   18%  , respectively, of our 2015 consolidated Net sales. The loss of, or change in business relationship with, any of these or any other key vendor partners, the diminished availability of their products, or backlogs for their products leading to manufacturer allocation, could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position. 
  Additionally, the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for, and the cost of, working capital and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows. Further, the sale, spin-off or combination of any of our vendor partners and/or certain of their business units, including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or cash flows.  
  Our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware, software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings, and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers.  
  The technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware, software and services offerings, such as cloud-based solutions, including SaaS, IaaS and PaaS, and the Internet of Things ( IoT ). We have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware, software and services offerings, as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers. A decrease in the rate of innovation, or the lack of acceptance of innovations by customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In addition, if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware, software and services offerings, for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers, sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers, our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. 
  We also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware, software and services to compete effectively with hardware, software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels. In addition, our success is dependent on our ability to develop relationships with and sell hardware, software and services from new emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace. To the extent that a vendor s offering that is highly in demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels, and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels, or we are unable to develop relationships with new technology providers or companies that we have not historically represented, our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.  
  Substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance.  
  Our current competition includes:  
             
    resellers, such as Computacenter, Dimension Data, ePlus, Insight Enterprises, PC Connection, PCM, Presidio, SCC, Softchoice, World Wide Technology and many smaller resellers; 
                
    manufacturers who sell directly to customers, such as Dell, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Apple; 
                
    large service providers and system integrators, such as IBM, Accenture, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell; 
                
    e-tailers, such as Amazon, Newegg and TigerDirect.com; 
                
    cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Box; and 
        10 

     Table of Contents  

retailers (including their e-commerce activities), such as Staples and Office Depot. 
     We expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed. While innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell, it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors. For instance, while cloud-based solutions present an opportunity for us, cloud-based solutions and technologies that deliver technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us, or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell, leading to a reduction in our sales and/or profitability. In addition, some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell, and could intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to our customers. Moreover, traditional OEMs have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers, which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers. If any of these trends becomes more prevalent, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.  
  We focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers. To the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers, we may be required to reduce prices, increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales, which may require us to reduce prices. This would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit. If such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products, our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected. 
  The success of our business depends on the continuing development, maintenance and operation of our information technology systems.  
  Our success is dependent on the accuracy, proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems, including our business systems, such as our sales, customer management, financial and accounting, marketing, purchasing, warehouse management, e-commerce and mobile systems, as well as our operational platforms, including voice and data networks and power systems. The quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems, and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades, affects, among other things, our ability to:  
             
    conduct business with our customers, including delivering services and solutions to them; 
                
    manage our inventory and accounts receivable; 
                
    purchase, sell, ship and invoice our hardware and software products and provide and invoice our services efficiently and on a timely basis; and 
                
    maintain our cost-efficient operating model while scaling our business. 
     The integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control. While we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats, including computer viruses, malware, phishing, social engineering, unauthorized access and other malicious attacks, both internal and external, and human error, there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective. Furthermore, although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems, there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required. Any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business and results of operations.  
  Breaches of data security could adversely impact our business.  
  Our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of coworkers, customers and others. In addition, we operate data centers for our customers which host their technology infrastructure and may store and transmit both business-critical data and confidential information. In connection with our services business, our coworkers also have access to our customers  confidential data and other information. We have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches; however, as newer technologies evolve, we could be exposed to increased risk of breaches in security. Breaches in security could expose us, our customers or other individuals to a risk of public disclosure, loss or misuse of this information, resulting in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. Such breaches, costs and consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.

   The failure to comply with our public sector contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in, among other things, termination, fines or other liabilities, and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Revenues from our public sector customers are derived from sales to governmental entities, educational institutions and healthcare customers, through various contracts and open market sales of products and services. Sales to public sector customers are highly regulated. Noncompliance with contract provisions, government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations (including the False Claims Act and the Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the United States) could result in civil, criminal and administrative liability, including substantial monetary fines or damages, termination of government contracts or other public sector customer contracts, and suspension, debarment or ineligibility from doing business with the government and other customers in the public sector. In addition, contracts in the public sector are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization ( GPO ) or upon default. Furthermore, our inability to enter into or retain contracts with GPOs may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those GPOs and compete. The effect of any of these possible actions could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.  
  If we fail to provide high-quality services to our customers, or if our third-party service providers fail to provide high-quality services to our customers, our reputation, business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. 
  Our service offerings include field services, managed services, warranties, configuration services, partner services and telecom services. Additionally, we deliver and manage mission critical software, systems and network solutions for our customers. We also offer certain services, such as implementation and installation services and repair services, to our customers through various third-party service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf. If we or our third-party service providers fail to provide high quality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers  businesses, this could, among other things, result in legal claims and proceedings and liability. Moreover, as we expand our services and solutions business, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory and other risks. We also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation with our customers, our brand and our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. 
  If we lose any of our key personnel, or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer.  
  Our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business, including our key executive, management, sales, services and technical coworkers.  
  Our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of Thomas E. Richards, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers. Our future success also will depend on our ability to retain our customer-facing coworkers, who have been given critical CDW knowledge regarding, and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with, many of our customers. In addition, as we seek to expand our offerings of value-added services and solutions, our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers, for whom the market is extremely competitive.  
  Our inability to attract, develop and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and adversely affect our ability to expand our offerings of value-added services and solutions. Moreover, our inability to train our sales, services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel. Such consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.  
  The interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain. 
  A significant portion of the products we sell are manufactured or purchased by our vendor partners outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia. Political, social or economic instability in Asia, or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell, could cause disruptions in trade, including exports to the U.S. Other events that could also cause disruptions to our supply chain include:  
             
    the imposition of additional trade law provisions or regulations; 
                
    the imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on imports and exports; 
        12 

     Table of Contents  

foreign currency fluctuations; 
                
    natural disasters or other adverse occurrences at, or affecting, any of our suppliers  facilities; 
                
    restrictions on the transfer of funds; 
                
    the financial instability or bankruptcy of manufacturers; and 
                
    significant labor disputes, such as strikes. 
     We cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell are purchased or manufactured, or may be purchased or manufactured in the future, will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments, including the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Trade restrictions, including new or increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, sanctions, safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell, as well as foreign labor strikes and work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, our exports are subject to regulations and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.  
  A natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business.  
  We have two warehouse and distribution facilities in the United States and one in the United Kingdom. If the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence, we could utilize another distribution center or third-party distributors to ship products to our customers. However, this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs. In addition, we operate three customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both business-critical data and confidential information of our customers. A natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business, results of operations or cash flows.  
  We are heavily dependent on commercial delivery services.  
  We generally ship hardware products to our customers by FedEx, United Parcel Service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges. If we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services, our profitability could be adversely affected. Additionally, strikes, inclement weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis. 
  We are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks.  
  We extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales, typically on 30-day payment terms. We are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased, or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced, the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty or, in the case of public sector customers, during periods of budget constraints.  
  We are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell. We seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies, including our rapid-turn inventory model, as well as vendor price protection and product return programs. However, if we were unable to maintain our rapid-turn inventory model, if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions, our inventory risks could increase. We also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request. These bulk purchases could increase our exposure to inventory obsolescence.  
  We could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances. 
  We may continue to pursue transactions, including strategic investments, acquisitions or alliances, in an effort to extend or complement our existing business. These types of transactions involve numerous business risks, including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us, the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns, extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience, entering into new geographic markets, the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses, any of which could adversely affect our operations.  
     13 

     Table of Contents  

   In addition, our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded. To the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. 
  Our future operating results may fluctuate significantly.  
  We may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations. These fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors, including the condition of the technology industry in general, shifts in demand and pricing for hardware, software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades.  
  Our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including general macroeconomic conditions; pricing pressures; changes in product costs from our vendor partners; the availability of price protection, purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners; changes in product, order size and customer mix; the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete; increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers; and general market and competitive conditions.  
  In addition, our cost structure is based, in part, on anticipated sales and gross margins. Therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall, and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.  
  Fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our reported results of operations. 
  Our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. While our Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of our international subsidiaries, particularly the British pound and the Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in our reported results of operations. We also have foreign currency exposure to the extent sales and purchases are not denominated in a subsidiary s functional currency, such as sales and purchases in euros, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows. 
  We are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits.  
  We are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, which include commercial, employment, tort and other litigation.  
  We are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business, either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services, in the form of cease-and-desist letters, licensing inquiries, lawsuits and other communications and demands. In our industry, such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased. Increasingly, many of these assertions are brought by non-practicing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue, but we may also be subject to suits from inventors, competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue, lost profits and/or an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities, including selling certain products and services.  
  Because of our significant sales to governmental entities, we also are subject to audits by federal, state, international, national, provincial and local authorities. We also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers, including government agencies, relating to purchases and sales under various contracts. In addition, we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts.  
  Current and future litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits or indemnification claims that we face, including the SEC s investigation of our vendor partner program incentives, may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome. In addition, these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations. Litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.

   Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Our operations are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas including areas of labor and employment, advertising, e-commerce, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, and environmental, health, and safety. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business, and the risk of noncompliance. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no guarantee against coworkers, contractors, or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. As a public company, we also are subject to increasingly complex public disclosure, corporate governance and accounting requirements that increase compliance costs and require significant management focus.  
  We have significant deferred cancellation of debt income.  
  As a result of a 2009 debt modification, we realized $395.5 million of cancellation of debt income ( CODI ). We made an election under Code Section 108(i) to defer this CODI from taxable income, pursuant to which we are also required to defer certain original issue discount ( OID ) deductions as they accrue. As of December 31, 2013, we had deferred approximately $114.5 million of OID deductions. Starting in 2014, we were required to include the deferred CODI and the deferred OID into taxable income ratably over a five-year period ending in 2018. Because we have more CODI than the aggregate of our deferred OID on the relevant remaining debt instruments, we will have a future cash tax liability associated with our significant deferred CODI. We have reflected the associated cash tax liability in our deferred taxes for financial accounting purposes. 
  All of our deferred CODI will be accelerated into current taxable income if, prior to 2018, we engage in a so-called  impairment transaction  and the gross value of our assets immediately afterward is less than 110% of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred CODI and OID (the  110% test ) as determined under the applicable Treasury Regulations. An  impairment transaction  is any transaction that impairs our ability to pay the tax on our deferred CODI, and includes dividends or distributions with respect to our equity and charitable contributions, in each case in a manner that is not consistent with our historical practice within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. 
  Prior to 2018, our willingness to pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our equity could be adversely affected if, at the time, we do not meet the 110% test and, as a result, the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution would accelerate the tax payable with respect to our deferred CODI. We believe that, based on our interpretation of applicable Treasury Regulations, the gross value of our assets exceeds 110% of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred CODI and OID as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be true in the future. 
  Risks Related to Our Indebtedness  
  We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have important consequences to our business. 
  We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31,   2015  , we had   $3.3 billion   of total long-term debt outstanding, as defined by GAAP, and   $439.6 million   of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements, and the ability to borrow an additional   $843.1 million   under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Loan ) and an additional    50.0 million   (  $73.7 million  ) under our Kelway revolving credit facility ( Kelway Credit Facility ). Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:  
             
    making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness; 
                
    requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments on our and our subsidiaries  debt, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 
                
    requiring us to comply with restrictive covenants in our senior credit facilities and indentures, which limit the manner in which we conduct our business; 
                
    making it more difficult for us to obtain vendor financing from our vendor partners, including original equipment manufacturers and software publishers; 
                
    limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate; 
                
    placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less-leveraged competitors; 
        15 

     Table of Contents  

increasing our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and 
                
    limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.  
     Restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and, to a lesser degree, our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity.  
  Our senior credit facilities and, to a lesser degree, our indentures contain, and any future indebtedness of ours may contain, various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:  
             
    incur or guarantee additional debt; 
                
    pay dividends or make distributions to holders of our capital stock or to make certain other restricted payments or investments; 
                
    repurchase or redeem capital stock; 
                
    make loans, capital expenditures or investments or acquisitions; 
                
    receive dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries; 
                
    enter into transactions with affiliates; 
                
    create liens; 
                
    merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;  
                
    transfer or sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; and 
                
    prepay, repurchase or redeem debt. 
     As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. A breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders: 
             
    will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us; 
                
    could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable; or  
                
    could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings. 
     The acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures. 
  If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior credit facilities. If the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to us. 
  In addition, under our Revolving Loan, we are permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of up to $1,250.0 million. However, our ability to borrow under our Revolving Loan is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition. The borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85% of CDW LLC and its subsidiary guarantors  eligible accounts receivable (net of accounts reserves) (up to 30% of such eligible accounts receivable which can consist of federal government accounts receivable) plus the lesser of (i) 75% of CDW LLC and its subsidiary guarantors  eligible inventory (valued at cost and net of inventory reserves) and (ii) the product of 85% multiplied by the net orderly liquidation value percentage multiplied by eligible inventory (valued at cost and net of inventory reserves), less reserves (other than accounts reserves and inventory reserves). The borrowing base in effect as of December 31,   2015   was   $1,423.1 million  , and therefore, did not restrict our ability to borrow under our Revolving Loan as of that date.  
     16 

     Table of Contents  

   Our ability to borrow under our Revolving Loan is also limited by a minimum liquidity condition, which provides that, if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of (i) $125.0 million and (ii) the greater of (A) 10% of the borrowing base and (B) $100.0 million, the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under our Revolving Loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement for our Revolving Loan) is at least 1.0 to 1.0. Moreover, our Revolving Loan provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability reserves, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us. We cannot assure you that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or, were it to do so, that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity. 
  We will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and, if not successful, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. 
  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Our outstanding long-term debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us and, accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources  included elsewhere in this report. 
  If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or revise or delay our strategic plan. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior credit facilities and indentures. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our senior credit facilities restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Furthermore, Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity have no obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing. 
  If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result: 
             
    our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable; 
                
    the lenders under our senior credit facilities could foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings from them and the lenders under our Revolving Loan and Kelway Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money; and 
                
    we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.  
     Despite our indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt. This could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.  
  We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, will increase. As of December 31,   2015  , we had   $843.1 million   available for additional borrowing under our Revolving Loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations (net of   $2.1 million   of issued and undrawn letters of credit and   $439.6 million   of reserves related to our floorplan sub-facility) and an additional    50.0 million   (  $73.7 million  ) available under our Kelway Credit Facility. 
  Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.  
  Certain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As of December 31,   2015  , we had   $1,586.5 million   of variable rate debt outstanding, $1,498.1 million of which is subject to a 1.0% LIBOR floor. If interest rates increase above 1% per annum, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. Although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility, we  
     17 

     Table of Contents  

   cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate cap agreements in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective.  
  Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
  Our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment. 
  The market price for our common stock may be volatile. Our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares, due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, which may be caused by a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the following: 
             
    changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of our common stock; 
                
    downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock; 
                
    future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders, including Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity; 
                
    market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole; 
                
    investors  perceptions of our prospects; 
                
    announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments; and 
                
    changes in key personnel. 
     In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. In the past, securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business. 
  Future sales or distributions of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales or distributions may occur, may depress our stock price. 
  Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. As of February 19, 2016, there were   167,740,043   shares of our common stock outstanding. The shares of our common stock sold in our initial public offering and in registered secondary offerings are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), except that any shares of our common stock that may be acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, may be sold only in compliance with certain volume limitations and other restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. 
  The remaining shares of our common stock, to the extent not previously sold pursuant to an exemption from registration, will continue to be  restricted securities  within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and subject to certain restrictions on resale. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144 under the Securities Act. 
  As of February 19, 2016, the holders of approximately 16,000,000 shares of our common stock, including Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity, will continue to have the right to require us to register the sales of such shares under the Securities Act, under the terms of an agreement between us and the holders. As of February 19, 2016, Madison Dearborn beneficially owned approximately 4.9% of our common stock and Providence Equity beneficially owned approximately 4.3% of our common stock.  Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity are permitted to distribute all or a portion of the shares of common stock that they hold in one or more pro rata distributions to their respective limited partners, and the recipients of the shares would generally be permitted to sell the shares immediately pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.  A distribution of shares by Madison Dearborn or Providence Equity, and the subsequent sale of shares by the recipients, or the perception that such a distribution and subsequent sale of shares might occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares  . 
     18 

     Table of Contents  

   In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. 
  Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable. 
  Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the Company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions: 
             
    authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; 
                
    establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time; 
                
    generally prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; 
                
    provide that special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by or at the direction of our Board of Directors pursuant to a written resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of the majority of the total number of directors that the Company would have if there were no vacancies; 
                
    establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and 
                
    provide that our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws. 
     Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire. 
  Conflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity. 
  Paul Finnegan and Robin Selati, who are principals of Madison Dearborn, and Glenn Creamer and Michael Dominguez, who are managing directors of Providence Equity, serve on our Board of Directors. Madison Dearborn, Providence Equity and the entities respectively controlled by them may hold equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us, and companies in which they currently invest may begin competing with us. As a result of these relationships, when conflicts arise between the interests of Madison Dearborn or Providence Equity, on the one hand, and of other stockholders, on the other hand, these directors may not be disinterested. Although our directors and officers have a duty of loyalty to us under Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible so long as (1) the material facts relating to the director s or officer s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our Board of Directors and a majority of our disinterested directors approves the transaction, (2) the material facts relating to the director s or officer s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our stockholders and a majority of our disinterested stockholders approve the transaction or (3) the transaction is otherwise fair to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that any principal, officer, member, manager and/or employee of Madison Dearborn or Providence Equity or any entity that controls, is controlled by or under common control with Madison Dearborn or Providence Equity (other than us or any company that is controlled by us) or an investment fund managed by Madison Dearborn or Providence Equity will not be required to offer any transaction opportunity of which they become aware to us and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is offered to them solely in their capacities as our directors.

     Table of Contents  

   We cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program, and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on, or make share repurchases of, our common stock. If we do not continue to pay dividends, you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price. 
  We expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.1075 per share per quarter, or $0.43 per share per annum. However, any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Any determination to pay dividends on, or repurchase, shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on, or repurchase, shares of our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, in each case, under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will repurchase shares of our common stock. If we do not pay dividends in the future, realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. See  --Risks Related to Our Business--We have significant deferred cancellation of debt income  for a discussion of certain tax considerations that could affect our willingness to pay dividends in the future  . 
  We are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. 
  We are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries  ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. 
    Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
  None. 
    Item 2. Properties 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , we owned or leased a total of   2.5 million   square feet of space, primarily in the U.S., Canada and United Kingdom. We own two properties: a combined office and a 442,000 square foot distribution center in Vernon Hills, Illinois and a 513,000 square foot distribution center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. In addition, we conduct sales, services and administrative activities in various leased locations primarily in the U.S., Canada and United Kingdom, including data centers in Madison, Wisconsin, Minneapolis, Minnesota and the United Kingdom. 
  We believe our facilities are well maintained, suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs. As part of our normal business, we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability. Leases covering our currently occupied leased properties expire at varying dates, generally within the next ten years. We anticipate no difficulty in retaining occupancy through lease renewals, month-to-month occupancy or replacing the leased properties with equivalent properties. We believe that suitable additional or substitute leased properties will be available as required.  
    Item 3. Legal Proceedings  
  We are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, which include commercial, intellectual property, employment, tort and other litigation matters. We are also subject to audit by federal, state, international, national, provincial and local authorities, and by various partners, group purchasing organizations and customers, including government agencies, relating to purchases and sales under various contracts. In addition, we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts. From time to time, certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the U.S. bankruptcy laws or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the United States. In such cases, certain pre-petition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator. 
  On October 29, 2015, the Company received a request for production of documents in connection with an investigation by the SEC of the Company s vendor partner program incentives. The Company has produced documents to the SEC and is continuing to cooperate with the SEC in this matter. 
  As of December 31, 2015  , we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters, if any, has been incurred. However, the ultimate resolutions of  
     20 

     Table of Contents  

   these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable. As such, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters.

    Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  Market Information 
  Our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market since   June 27, 2013   under the symbol  CDW.  Prior to that date, there was no public market for our common stock. Shares sold in our initial public offering ( IPO ) were priced at   $17.00   per share on June 26, 2013. The following table sets forth the ranges of high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the cash dividends per share of common stock declared for the two most recent fiscal years. 

Holders 
  As of   February 19, 2016  , there were   59   holders of record of our common stock. The number of beneficial stockholders is substantially greater than the number of holders of record because a portion of our common stock is held through brokerage firms. 
  Dividends 
  On   February 9, 2016  , we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of   $0.1075   per share. The dividend will be paid on   March 10, 2016   to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on   February 25, 2016  .  
  We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock in the future, but such payments remain at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, in each case, under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness. For a discussion of our cash resources and needs and restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources  included elsewhere in this report. For additional discussion of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, see   Note 8     (Long-Term Debt)   to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  Information relating to our purchases of our common stock during the quarter ended   December 31, 2015   is as follows: 

(1) 
    On   November 30, 2015  , we completed a public offering of   9.2 million   shares of our common stock by certain selling stockholders, which included   1.2 million   shares sold by the selling stockholders to the underwriters pursuant to the grant of an option that was exercised in full. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares. Subsequent to the  
        24 

     Table of Contents  

   completion of this offering, we purchased from the underwriters   1.0 million   of the shares of our common stock that were subject to the offering at a price per share equal to the price paid by the underwriters to the selling stockholders in the offering. All other share repurchases during the period were made through the open market. 
           (2) 
    On   November 6, 2014  , we announced that the Board of Directors approved a   $500 million   share repurchase program, which became effective immediately, under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, depending on share price, market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares and repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice. 
     Stock Performance Graph 
  The information contained in this Stock Performance Graph section shall not be deemed to be  soliciting material  or  filed  or incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
  The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return, calculated on a dividend reinvested basis, on $100.00 invested at the opening of the market on June 27, 2013, the date our common stock first traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, through and including the market close on   December 31, 2015  , with the cumulative total return for the same time period of the same amount invested in the S P MidCap 400 index and a peer group index. Our peer group index for   2015   consists of the following companies: Accenture plc, Anixter International, Inc., Arrow Electronics, Inc., Avnet, Inc., CGI Group Inc., Genuine Parts Company, Henry Schein, Inc., Insight Enterprises, Inc., Owens   Minor, Inc., Patterson Companies, Inc., SYNNEX Corporation, United Stationers Inc., W.W. Grainger, Inc. and Wesco International, Inc.

  The selected financial data set forth below are not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations and should be read in conjunction with  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes. 
  We have derived the selected financial data presented below as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 from our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.

    Includes capitalized lease obligations of $3.2 million and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
              (3) 
    EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. We have included a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the table below. Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.  
     We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility ( Term Loan ), including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The following unaudited table sets forth reconciliations of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented: 

(a) 
    During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011, we recorded net losses on extinguishments of long-term debt. The losses represented the difference between the amount paid upon extinguishment, including call premiums and expenses paid to the debt holders and agents, and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt, adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs. 
              (b) 
    Represents our share of net income/loss from our equity investments. Our 35% share of Kelway s net loss includes our 35% share of an expense related to certain equity awards granted by one of the sellers to Kelway coworkers in July 2015 prior to the acquisition. 
              (c) 
    Primarily includes expenses related to the acquisition of Kelway. 
              (d) 
    Represents the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of Kelway. 
        28

            (e) 
    Other adjustments primarily include certain historical retention costs, unusual, non-recurring litigation matters, secondary-offering-related expenses and expenses related to the consolidation of office locations north of Chicago. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded IPO- and secondary-offering related expenses of $75.0 million. For additional information on the IPO- and secondary-offering related expenses, see Note 10 (Stockholder s Equity) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
              (f) 
    Includes the impact of consolidating five months for the year ended December 31, 2015 of Kelway s financial results. 
              (4) 
    Non-GAAP net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. Non-GAAP net income is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. We believe that non-GAAP net income provides meaningful information regarding our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements.  
     The following unaudited table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income for the periods presented: 

(a) 
    Includes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, customer contracts and trade names. 
              (b) 
    Represents our 35% share of an expense related to certain equity awards granted by one of the sellers to Kelway coworkers in July 2015 prior to our acquisition of Kelway.  
              (c) 
    Primarily includes expenses related to the acquisition of Kelway. 
              (d) 
    Represents the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of Kelway. 
              (e) 
    Primarily includes expenses related to the consolidation of office locations north of Chicago and secondary-offering-related expenses. Amount in 2013 primarily relates to IPO- and secondary-offering related expenses. 
              (f) 
    Based on a normalized effective tax rate of 38.0% (39.0% prior to the Kelway acquisition), except for the non-cash equity-based compensation from our equity investment and the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of Kelway, which were tax effected at a rate of 35.4%. The aggregate adjustment for income taxes also includes a $4.0 million deferred tax benefit recorded during the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of a tax rate reduction in the United Kingdom and additional tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $3.3 million as a result of recording withholding tax on the unremitted earnings of our Canadian subsidiary. Additionally, note that certain acquisition costs are non-deductible.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See  Forward-Looking Statements  above. 
    Overview 
  CDW is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ( IT ) solutions in North America and the United Kingdom. We help our customer base of over   250,000   small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers by delivering critical solutions to their increasingly complex IT needs. Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration. We are technology  agnostic,  with a product portfolio including more than   100,000   products from more than   1,000   brands. We provide our products and solutions through more than   5,000   customer-facing coworkers, including field sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers. 
  We are a leading sales channel partner in North America and the United Kingdom for many original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) and software publishers (collectively, our  vendor partners ), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. We believe we are an important extension of our vendor partners  sales and marketing capabilities, providing them with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage and extensive customer access.  
  On August 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kelway TopCo Limited ( Kelway ) by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. Kelway is a U.K.-based IT solutions provider, which has global supply chain relationships that enable it to conduct business in   more than 80 countries  . This investment strengthens our ability to provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers and enhances our ability to serve our existing multi-national customers. We included the financial results of Kelway in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. For additional information relating to the acquisition, see   Note 3     (Acquisition)   to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  We have two reportable segments: Corporate, which is comprised primarily of private sector business customers in the U.S., and Public, which is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the U.S. Our Corporate segment is divided into a medium/large business customer channel, primarily serving customers with more than 100 employees, and a small business customer channel, primarily serving customers with up to 100 employees. We also have three other operating segments: CDW Advanced Services; Canada; and Kelway, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ( Other ). For additional information relating to Kelway, see   Note 3     (Acquisition)   to these Consolidated Financial Statements. The CDW Advanced Services business consists primarily of customized engineering services delivered by technology specialists and engineers, and managed services that include Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) offerings. Effective January 1, 2016, the CDW Advanced Services business will be included in our Corporate and Public segments and Other will be comprised of Canada and Kelway. Revenues in the U.S. from the sale of hardware, software, custom configuration and third-party provided services are recorded within our Corporate and Public segments.  
  We may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. We also resell software for major software publishers. Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. A significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners. These programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time.

   Trends and Key Factors Affecting our Financial Performance 
  We believe the following trends may have an important impact on our financial performance: 
             
    Our Public segment sales are impacted by government spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels. An adverse change in any of these factors could cause our Public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew contracts with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales to federal customers increased year-over-year in the mid-teens as we continued to benefit from strategic changes made to better align with new federal government purchasing programs implemented last year. During the same period, sales to state and local customers also increased year-over-year in the mid-teens, driven by the continued focus on public safety. Meeting K-12 customer digital curriculum testing needs through sales of client devices was a significant contributor to education sales throughout 2014 and into early 2015. Education sales decreased slightly in 2015 as a decline in K-12 client device sales was partially offset by an increase in netcomm sales. In 2015, we were named as provider on both the largest number of applications and the largest dollar amounts requested for funds by K-12 customers to support internal connections for the 2014-2015 program year of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission E-Rate program. The amount and timing of E-Rate funds approval and customer implementation is not certain. 
                
    An important factor affecting our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted operating results is the impact of general economic conditions on our customers  willingness to spend on information technology. During the year ended December 31, 2015, global economic signals were mixed. We continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions. Uncertainties related to potential changes in tax and regulatory policy, potential interest rate increases, weakening consumer and business confidence or increased unemployment could result in reduced or deferred spending on information technology products and services by our customers and result in increased competitive pricing pressures.  
                
    We believe that our customers  transition to more complex technology solutions will continue to be an important growth area for us in the future. However, because the market for technology products and services is highly competitive, our success at capitalizing on this transition will be based on our ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, the quality and breadth of our product and service offerings, the knowledge and expertise of our sales force, price, product availability and speed of delivery. During the year ended December 31, 2015, customer priorities continued to shift away from last year's focus on client devices towards more integrated solutions, which grew substantially faster than transactional sales.  
       Key Business Metrics 
  Our management monitors a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, return on invested capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker, and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.  
  Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (the  Term Loan ), including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and   Note 8     (Long-Term Debt)   to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. For the definitions of Non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations to Net income, see  Results of Operations .

   The results of certain key business metrics are as follows: 

(1) 
    As a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03 during the second quarter of 2015, historical periods have been revised to reflect the change in the presentation of deferred financing costs, which are now shown as a reduction of Long-term debt, instead of being presented as a separate asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the third quarter of 2015, we adopted ASU 2015-15 which allows entities to present deferred financing costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset. We retroactively adjusted the deferred financing costs and Long-term debt liability presented in historical periods to align it to the current period presentation.

   Net sales 
  Net sales by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of total Net sales, and the year-over-year dollar and percentage change in Net sales for the years ended   December 31, 2015 and 2014   are as follows: 

Total Net sales in   2015   increased   $914.2 million  , or   7.6%  , to   $12,988.7 million  , compared to   $12,074.5 million   in   2014  , reflecting both organic net sales growth and the impact of consolidating five months of Kelway net sales. Customer priorities continued to shift more towards integrated solutions, which drove higher growth in solutions sales compared to transactional product sales. Strong sales performance in solutions-focused products was driven by netcomm and server and server-related products. The growth in transactional products was led by notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. 
  Organic net sales, which excludes the impact of the acquisition of Kelway, increased   $563.5 million  , or   4.7%  , to   $12,638.0 million   in   2015  , compared to   $12,074.5 million   in   2014  . Organic net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, in   2015   increased   $635.0 million  , or   5.3%  , to   $12,638.0 million  , compared to   $12,003.0 million   in   2014  . For additional information, see  Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations  below. 
  Corporate segment net sales in   2015   increased   $340.9 million  , or   5.3%  , compared to   2014  , driven by sales growth in both our medium/large and small business customer channels and reflecting stronger performance in solutions sales compared to transactional product sales. Within our Corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased   $272.8 million  , or   5.0%  , year over year, primarily due to strong sales performance in solutions-focused products driven by netcomm products and server and server-related products. Growth in transactional products was driven by notebook/mobile devices, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. Net sales to small business customers increased by   $68.1 million  , or   6.9%  , between periods, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices and netcomm products, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. 
  Public segment net sales in   2015   increased   $246.1 million  , or   5.0%  , between years, due to strong sales performance in government and growth in healthcare, partially offset by education remaining relatively flat. Net sales to government customers increased   $226.5 million  , or   15.6%  , between periods, as sales to both federal and state/local government customers experienced mid-teens growth. The increase in net sales to the federal government was driven by growth in sales of netcomm products, software and enterprise storage, as we continued to benefit from strategic changes made to better align with new federal government purchasing programs implemented last year. A continued focus on public safety drove the increase in net sales to state/local government customers, which was led by netcomm products, notebooks/mobile devices and software, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. Net sales to education customers decreased   $17.0 million  , or   0.9%  , year over year, primarily due to declines in notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by growth in netcomm products. Net sales to healthcare customers increased   $36.6 million  , or   2.3%  , year over year, driven by growth in netcomm and server-related products, partially offset by declines in desktop

   computers and point-of-care technology carts, as some of our larger customers shifted priorities to reducing costs due to industry consolidation. 
  Net sales in Other in   2015   increased   $327.2 million  , or   45.5%  , compared   2014  . Other is comprised of CDW Advanced Services, Canada and Kelway. The increase in net sales was driven by the impact of consolidating five months of Kelway net sales, as well as growth in CDW Advanced Services, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. dollar-denominated net sales of Canada. The net sales of Canada in constant currency continued to grow during   2015   compared to   2014  . 
    Gross profit 
  Gross profit increased   $194.5 million  , or   10.1%  , to   $2,115.8 million   in   2015  , compared to   $1,921.3 million   in   2014  . As a percentage of net sales, Gross profit   increased     40   basis points to   16.3%   in   2015  , from   15.9%   in   2014  . 
  Net service contract revenue, including items such as third-party services, warranties and SaaS contributed a positive impact of 15 basis points to gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Gross profit margin was positively impacted 15 basis points due to a higher mix of services and improved product margin. We also experienced a favorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor partner funding. Vendor partner funding includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising. 
  Gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors. 
    Selling and administrative expenses 
  Selling and administrative expenses   increased     $115.7 million  , or   10.4%  , to   $1,226.0 million   in   2015  , compared to   $1,110.3 million   in   2014  . As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses   increased     20   basis points to   9.4%   in   2015  ,   up   from   9.2%   in   2014  . Sales payroll costs increased $60.1 million, or 12.0%, year over year, primarily due to increased sales compensation consistent with growth in solutions-related sales, an increase in Gross profit and consolidating five months of incremental Kelway sales payroll costs. In addition, certain coworker costs increased $9.5 million, or 3.8%, during   2015   compared to the prior year, due to higher costs consistent with increased coworker count, primarily due to our acquisition of Kelway. Total coworker count was   8,465   at   December 31, 2015  , up   1,254   from   7,211   at   December 31, 2014  . Amortization expense related to intangibles increased $16.7 million, or 9.2%, during   2015   compared to   2014  , primarily due to incremental amortization expense related to the intangible assets arising from our acquisition of Kelway. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased $14.8 million, or 90.7%, during   2015   compared to   2014  , primarily due to annual equity awards granted under our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2015, performance against long-term incentive program targets and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of Kelway. In addition, we incurred $10.2 million of acquisition and integration costs in 2015 related to our acquisition of Kelway. 
    Income from operations

     Income from operations was   $742.0 million   in   2015  , an increase of   $69.0 million  , or   10.3%  , compared to   $673.0 million   in   2014  . Total operating margin   increased     10   basis points to   5.7%   in   2015  , from   5.6%   in   2014  . Operating margin was positively impacted by the increase in gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales. This increase was driven by higher Net sales and Gross profit. 
  Corporate segment income from operations was   $470.1 million   in   2015  , an increase of   $30.3 million  , or   6.9%  , compared to   $439.8 million   in   2014  . Corporate segment operating margin   increased     10   basis points to   6.9%   in   2015  , from   6.8%   in   2014  . This increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit. 
  Public segment income from operations was   $343.3 million   in   2015  , an increase of   $30.1 million  , or   9.6%  , compared to   $313.2 million   in   2015  . Public segment operating margin   increased     30   basis points to   6.7%   in   2015  , from   6.4%   in   2014  . This increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit. 
    Interest expense, net 
  At   December 31, 2015  , our outstanding long-term debt totaled   $3,259.7 million  , compared to   $3,166.0 million   at   December 31, 2014  , an increase of $93.7 million primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of Kelway. Net interest expense in   2015   was   $159.5 million  , a decrease of   $37.8 million  , compared to   $197.3 million   in   2014  . This decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates for   2015  , compared to   2014   as a result of redemptions and refinancing activities completed during 2014 and 2015. 
    Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt 
  For information regarding our debt, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2015, we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt of   $24.3 million   compared to   $90.7 million   in 2014. 
  Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows: 

(1) 
    We redeemed or repurchased all of or a portion of the remaining aggregate principal amount outstanding. The loss recognized represents the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs and/or premium.

             (2) 
    We entered into the Revolving Loan, a new $1,250 million five-year senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The Revolving Loan replaced our previous revolving loan credit facility that was to mature on June 24, 2016. The loss recognized represents the write-off of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs. 
       Gain on remeasurement of equity investment 
  On August 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kelway by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. As a result, our previously held   35%   equity investment was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of   $98.1 million   recorded in Gain on remeasurement of equity investment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
    Income tax expense 
  Income tax expense was   $243.9 million   in   2015  , compared to   $142.8 million   in   2014  . The effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was   37.7%   and   36.8%   for   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  For   2015  , the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and withholding tax expense on the earnings of our Canadian business as a result of no longer asserting permanent reinvestment which was partially offset by a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the U.K. For   2014  , the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits. The higher effective tax rate for   2015   as compared to   2014   was primarily attributable to higher state income taxes due to lower state income tax credits and the aforementioned Canadian withholding tax expense partially offset by the deferred tax benefit reflecting the tax rate reduction in the U.K. We are asserting that the unremitted earnings of our U.K. business are indefinitely reinvested. 
    Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations 
  We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the years ended   December 31, 2015 and 2014   below. Non-GAAP net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. EBITDA is defined as consolidated Net income before interest expense, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Organic net sales growth is calculated as net sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions recorded within the last twelve months. Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis is calculated as organic net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on organic net sales compared to the prior period. Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.  
  We believe that Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan, including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see   Note 8     (Long-Term Debt)   to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Non-GAAP net income 
  Non-GAAP net income was   $503.5 million   for the year ended December 31,   2015  , an increase of   $93.6 million  , or   22.8%  , compared to   $409.9 million   for the year ended December 31,   2014  .

Net sales 
  Net sales by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of total Net sales, and the year-over-year dollar and percentage change in Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: 

Total Net sales in 2014 increased $1,305.9 million, or 12.1%, to $12,074.5 million, compared to $10,768.6 million in 2013. The increase in total Net sales was primarily the result of continued growth in transactional products driven by notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers, as customers across all channels refreshed their client devices and K-12 customers continued to prepare for digital testing requirements, and the addition of more than 140 customer-facing coworkers, the majority in pre- and post-sale technical positions such as technical specialists and service delivery roles. Growth in solutions-focused products, including netcomm and software, also contributed to the increase in Net sales during 2014.

     Table of Contents  

   Corporate segment net sales in 2014 increased $515.4 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2013, driven by sales growth in the medium/large customer channel. Within our Corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased $432.7 million, or 8.6%, year over year, primarily due to customers refreshing their client devices and making continued investments in technology infrastructure and a continued focus on seller productivity. This increase was led by growth in notebooks/mobile devices, netcomm products, software, and desktop computers. Net sales to small business customers increased $82.7 million, or 9.1%, year over year, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers due to customers refreshing their client devices. 
  Public segment net sales in 2014 increased $714.9 million, or 17.2%, year over year, driven by strong performance across all channels. In 2013, and through the second quarter of 2014, Public segment results were impacted by the combined and residual negative effects of sequestration, the partial shutdown of the federal government in 2013 and federal government budget uncertainty. However, with the finalization of federal budget allocations in early 2014, we began to see improvement in federal sales in the second quarter of 2014 and saw continued momentum through the third quarter of 2014 in conjunction with the federal fiscal year-end. This recovery continued into the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with increased customer confidence that a federal budget for 2015 would be in place. Net sales to government customers increased $198.8 million, or 15.9%. The increase in net sales to the federal government was led by increases in sales of notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers. The increase in net sales to state/local government customers was led by growth in sales of notebooks/mobile devices, netcomm products, enterprise storage, and software due to a continued focus on public safety solutions. Net sales to education customers increased $375.0 million, or 25.9%, year over year, led by growth in net sales to K-12 customers, reflecting increased sales of notebooks/mobile devices to support digital testing requirements. Net sales to healthcare customers increased $141.1 million, or 9.6%, between periods, driven by growth in netcomm products, notebook/mobile devices, and desktop computers. 
    Gross profit 
  Gross profit increased $161.0 million, or 9.1%, to $1,921.3 million in 2014, compared to $1,760.3 million in 2013. As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit decreased 40 basis points to 15.9% during 2014, down from 16.3% in 2013. Gross profit margin was negatively impacted 30 basis points by unfavorable price/mix changes within product margin, as transactional product categories such as notebooks/mobile devices and desktops experienced a higher rate of net sales growth than our overall net sales growth, accompanied by continuing product margin compression in these product categories. Additionally, we experienced an unfavorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor funding in 2014. Although vendor funding dollars increased, it represented a lower percentage of Net sales in 2014 compared to 2013. Vendor funding includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising.  
  Gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors. 
    Selling and administrative expenses 
  Selling and administrative expenses decreased $10.6 million, or 0.9%, to $1,110.3 million in 2014, compared to $1,120.9 million in 2013. The overall decrease was largely driven by the absence of $74.3 million in costs incurred during 2013 related to the completion of our IPO. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $31.4 million, or 14.3%, of certain coworker costs between years which was primarily due to higher compensation consistent with increased coworker count and attainment-based compensation accruals tied to annual performance. Total coworker count was 7,211, up 244 from 6,967 at December 31, 2013. In addition, sales payroll, including sales commissions and other variable compensation costs, increased $18.6 million, or 3.9% between years, consistent with higher sales and Gross profit. Further offsetting the decrease in Selling and administrative expenses was an increase in long-term compensation expense and equity compensation expense of $7.2 million during 2014. 
  As a percentage of Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses decreased 120 basis points to 9.2% in 2014, down from 10.4% in 2013. The decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales was largely driven by a decline of 70 basis points in costs related to the IPO in 2013. Sales payroll as a percentage of Net sales also decreased 30 basis points during 2014, reflecting the lower cost to serve transactional sales compared to solutions-focused sales, consistent with our variable compensation cost structure.

The increase in Income from operations was driven by higher Net sales and Gross profit and the absence of IPO-related costs. Total operating margin percentage increased 90 basis points to 5.6% in 2014, from 4.7% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, which was driven by the absence of $74.3 million in costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in Gross profit margin. 
  Corporate segment income from operations was $439.8 million in 2014, an increase of $76.5 million, or 21.1%, compared to $363.3 million in 2013. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit. Corporate segment operating margin percentage increased 70 basis points to 6.8% in     2014, from 6.1% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, which was driven by the absence of costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin. 
  Public segment income from operations was $313.2 million in 2014, an increase of $66.7 million, or 27.1%, compared to $246.5 million in 2013. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit. Public segment operating margin percentage increased 50 basis points to 6.4% in     2014, from 5.9% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, which was driven by the absence of costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin. 
    Interest expense, net 
  At December 31, 2014, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,166.0 million, compared to $3,226.0 million at December 31, 2013. We reduced our long-term debt during 2014 through refinancing activities to redeem our higher interest debt. Net interest expense in 2014 was $197.3 million, a decrease of $52.8 million, compared to $250.1 million in 2013. This decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances and effective interest rates for 2014, compared to 2013 as a result of debt repayments and refinancing activities completed during 2014 and 2013. 
    Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt 
  For information regarding our debt, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2014, we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt of $90.7 million compared to $64.0 million in 2013.

     Table of Contents  

   Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows: 

(1) 
    We redeemed or repurchased all or a portion of the aggregate principal amount outstanding. The loss recognized represents the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs and/or unamortized premium. 
       
           (2) 
    We entered into the Revolving Loan, a new $1,250 million five-year senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The Revolving Loan replaced our previous revolving loan credit facility that was to mature on June 24, 2016. The loss recognized represents the write-off of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs. 
              (3) 
    We entered into the Term Loan, a new $1,350 million seven-year Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. Substantially all of the proceeds were used to repay the $1,299.5 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the prior senior secured term loan facility. The loss recognized represents the write-off of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs. 
       Income tax expense 
  Income tax expense was $142.8 million in 2014, compared to $62.7 million in 2013. The effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 36.8% and 32.1% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.  
  For 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits. For 2013, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits and an adjustment to deferred state income taxes due to changes in apportionment factors. The higher effective tax rate for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in state tax apportionment factors had on deferred state income taxes in 2013 and a lower rate impact of state income tax credits due to the increase in income before income taxes in 2014.

   Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations 
  We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 below. Non-GAAP net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. EBITDA is defined as consolidated Net income before Interest expense, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.  
  We believe that Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan, including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see   Note 8     (Long-Term Debt)   to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Non-GAAP net income 
  Non-GAAP net income was $409.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $95.6 million, or 30.4%, compared to $314.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.  

(1) 
    Includes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, customer contracts and trade names. 
              (2) 
    Includes ($0.6 million) and ($6.3 million) of unusual, non-recurring litigation matters, ($1.1 million) and ($7.5 million) of adjustments to interest expense resulting from debt extinguishments and $1.4 million and $75.0 million of IPO and secondary-offering related expenses in 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
              (3) 
    Based on a normalized effective tax rate of 39.0%. 
       Adjusted EBITDA 
  Adjusted EBITDA was $907.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $98.5 million, or 12.2%, compared to $808.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. As a percentage of Net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 7.5% for both the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

Seasonality 
  While we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year, sales in our Corporate segment, which primarily serves private sector business customers, are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year. Additionally, sales in our Public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers. 
    Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    Overview 
  We finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations. We also have $843.1 million of availability for borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and an additional  50 million ($73.7 million) under the Kelway revolving credit facility. Our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our operating commitments, which primarily include the purchase of inventory, payroll and general expenses. We also take into consideration our overall capital allocation strategy which includes investment for future growth, dividend payments, acquisitions and stock repurchases. We believe we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available for at least the next year, however, there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds. The amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions. 
  Long-Term Debt Activities 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015 we had debt refinancings. In connection with these refinancings, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $24.3 million in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 
  Share Repurchase Program 
  During 2015, we repurchased 6.3 million shares of our common stock for $241.3 million under the previously announced $500 million share repurchase program. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Item 5,  Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

     Table of Contents  

   Acquisition 
  On August 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kelway by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100% and provided us control. For further details regarding the acquisition, see Note 3 (Acquisition) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Dividends 
  A summary of 2015 dividend activity for our common stock is as follows:  

On February 9, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.1075 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 10, 2016 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 25, 2016.  
  The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, in each case, under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness. 
    Cash Flows 
  Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are as follows:

       Table of Contents  

   Operating Activities 
  Cash flows from operating activities are as follows: 

(1) 
    Includes items such as Deferred income taxes, Depreciation and amortization, Equity-based compensation expense, Gain on remeasurement of equity method investment, Loss (income) from equity method investment and net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt. 
              (2) 
    The increase in cash flows reflected stronger operating results driven by organic sales growth and the impact of consolidating five months of Kelway financial results. A decrease in the net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt, as a result of fewer debt refinancing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014, and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher income tax expense, also contributed to the strong operating results. 
              (3) 
    The decrease in cash flows was driven by a higher accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2015 driven by higher sales in our Public segment where customers generally take longer to pay than customers in our Corporate segment, slower government payments in certain states due to budget issues and the lower accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2014 driven by early payments from certain customers. 
              (4) 
    The decrease in cash flows was primarily due to the lower inventory balance as of December 31, 2014 as a result of the timing of inventory receipts and earlier than expected inventory shipments at the end of 2014 due to accelerated customer roll-outs and an increase in inventory on-hand as of December 31, 2015 to support the growth in the business.  
              (5) 
    The increase in cash flows was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases, longer payment terms with certain vendors and growth in the business. 

(1) 
    Includes items such as depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation expense and net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt. 
               (3) 
    The increase in cash flows was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and earlier than expected inventory shipments at the end of 2014 due to accelerated customer rollouts.

    In order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs, we monitor our cash conversion cycle, defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average. Components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows: 

(1) 
    Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of trade accounts receivable, net at the end of the period divided by average daily net sales for the same three-month period. Also incorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables. 
              (2) 
    Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Merchandise inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of goods sold for the same three-month period.  
              (3) 
    Represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of goods sold for the same three-month period. 
     The cash conversion cycle remained at   21   days at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The increase in DSO was primarily driven by a higher Accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2015 driven by higher Public segment sales where customers generally take longer to pay than customers in our Corporate segment, slower government payments in certain states due to budget issues and an increase in Net sales and related Accounts receivable for third-party services such as software assurance and warranties. These services have an unfavorable impact on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis. These services have a favorable impact on DPO as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sale in the Statement of Operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales. In addition to the impact of these services on DPO, DPO also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms. 
  The cash conversion cycle decreased to 21 days at December 31, 2014 compared to 23 days at December 31, 2013, primarily driven by improvement in DSO. The decline in DSO was primarily driven by improved collections and early payments from certain customers. Additionally, the timing of inventory receipts at the end of 2014 had a favorable impact on DIO and an unfavorable impact on DPO. 
    Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities increased   $189.6 million   in   2015   compared to   2014  . The increase was primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of Kelway by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock on August 1, 2015. Additionally, capital expenditures increased   $35.1 million   to   $90.1 million   from   $55.0 million   for   2015   and   2014  , respectively, primarily for our new office location and an increase in spending related to improvements to our information technology systems. 
  Net cash used in investing activities increased $117.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013. We paid $86.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to acquire a 35% non-controlling interest in Kelway. Additionally, capital expenditures increased $7.9 million to $55.0 million from $47.1 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years. 
    Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities increased   $114.5 million   in   2015   compared to   2014  . The increase was primarily driven by share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2015 which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of $241.3 million. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Item 5,  Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.  The increase was partially offset by the changes in accounts payable-inventory financing, which resulted in an increase in cash provided for financing activities of $20.4 million, and the net impact of our debt transactions which resulted in cash outflows of $7.1 million and $145.9 million during the years  
     47 

     Table of Contents  

   ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in cash provided by accounts payable-inventory financing was primarily due to a new vendor added to our previously existing inventory financing agreement. For a description of the inventory financing transactions impacting each period, see Note 6 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. For a description of the debt transactions impacting each period, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Net cash used in financing activities decreased $56.3 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily driven by several debt refinancing transactions during each period and our July 2013 IPO, which generated net proceeds of $424.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts, expenses and transaction costs. The net impact of our debt transactions resulted in cash outflows of $145.9 million and $518.3 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, as cash was used in each period to reduce our total long-term debt. For a description of the debt transactions impacting each period, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements 
  As of December 31, 2015, we had total indebtedness of   $3.3 billion  , of which   $1.6 billion   was secured indebtedness. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures. The amount of CDW s restricted payment capacity under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility was $679.7 million at December 31, 2015. 
  For further details regarding our debt and each of the transactions described below, see   Note 8     (Long-Term Debt)   to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the following events occurred with respect to our debt structure: 
             
    On August 1, 2015, we consolidated Kelway s Term Loan and Kelway s Revolving Credit Facility. Kelway s Term Loan is denominated in British Pounds. The Kelway Revolving Credit Facility is a multi-currency revolving credit facility under which Kelway is permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of    50.0 million   (  $73.7 million  ) as of December 31, 2015. 
         Inventory Financing Agreements 
  We have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. For further details, see   Note 6     (Inventory Financing Agreements)   to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Contractual Obligations 
  We have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments, operating leases and asset retirement obligations. Our estimated future payments, based on undiscounted amounts, under contractual obligations that existed as of December 31, 2015, are as follows: 

48 

     Table of Contents  

            (1) 
    Includes future principal and cash interest payments on long-term borrowings through scheduled maturity dates. Interest payments for variable rate debt were calculated using interest rates as of December 31, 2015. Excluded from these amounts are the amortization of debt issuance and other costs related to indebtedness. 
              (2) 
    Includes future principal and cash interest payments on long-term borrowings through scheduled maturity dates. Interest on the Senior Notes is calculated using the stated interest rates. Excluded from these amounts are the amortization of debt issuance and other costs related to indebtedness.  
              (3) 
    Includes the minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases of properties and equipment used in our operations. Additionally, included in these amounts are future minimum lease payments commencing in the fourth quarter of 2016 that relate to the lease entered into in December 2014 for our new office location north of Chicago. Also reflected in these amounts is the future expiration of two leases in the first quarter of 2016 for facilities currently in use by us which will be consolidated into an office location north of Chicago and accordingly, these leases will not be renewed. Capital leases included in property and equipment are not material. 
              (4) 
    Represent commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. 
       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
    Inflation 
  Inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results. We generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers, though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing. We also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements and by accelerating our overall cash conversion cycle. There can be no assurances, however, that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future.  
    Commitments and Contingencies 
  The information set forth in   Note 14     (Commitments and Contingencies)   to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.  
    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates have not historically required significant management judgment. Our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates, nor have we historically made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates. We do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  In   Note 1     (Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)   to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made, and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  We are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers, including OEMs, software publishers and wholesale distributors. We record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Our shipping terms typically specify F.O.B. destination, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.  
     49 

     Table of Contents  

   Revenues from the sales of hardware products and software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales. These items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways, including (i) as physical product shipped from our warehouse, (ii) via drop-shipment by the vendor or supplier, or (iii) via electronic delivery for software licenses. At the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience. Our vendor partners warrant most of the products we sell.  
  We leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. We recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify F.O.B. destination. We recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer, we set the price of the product charged to the customer, we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced, and we work closely with our customers to determine their hardware and software specifications. These arrangements generally represent approximately   45% to 55%   of total net sales, including approximately   15% to 20%   related to electronic delivery for software licenses.  
  Revenue from professional services is either recognized as provided for services billed at an hourly rate, recognized using a percentage of completion model for fixed fee project work or recognized using a proportional performance model for services provided at a fixed fee. Revenue from cloud computing solutions including Software as a Service ( SaaS ) and Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) arrangements, as well as data center services such as managed and remote managed services, server co-location, internet connectivity and data backup and storage, is recognized over the period service is provided. 
  We also sell certain products for which we act as an agent. Products in this category include the sale of third-party services, warranties, software assurance ( SA ) and third-party hosted SaaS and IaaS arrangements. SA is a product that allows customers to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the SA is in effect. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition, and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale. Under net sales recognition, the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction.  
  Our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and SA under enterprise agreements ( EAs ). Under EAs, customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year, regardless of changes to their employee base. Customers are charged an annual true-up fee for changes in the number of users over the year. With most EAs, our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly, paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales. We record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount. In certain instances, we bill the customer directly under an EA and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item. Our vendors typically dictate how the EA will be sold to the customer.  
  We also sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables, which may include a combination of the products and services. For each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting, total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element. The allocated arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above. Selling prices are determined by using vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) if it exists. Otherwise, selling prices are determined using third party evidence ( TPE ). If neither VSOE or TPE is available, we use our best estimate of selling prices. 
  We record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a Cost of sales. 
  Deferred   revenue includes (1) payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services, and (2) amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met.    
  We perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales in-transit to customers at the end of each period based on a weighted-average analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes drop-shipment arrangements. This analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount   of   sales in-transit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been received by the customer. Changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period. 
  Vendor Programs 
  We receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances, volume rebates, bid programs, price protection and other programs. These incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory, depending on the nature of the incentive. Vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs, which could have an impact on our results of operations. 
     50 

     Table of Contents  

   We record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. Some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets, and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets. If actual performance does not match our estimates, we may be required to adjust our receivables. We record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors  inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims; however, if actual collections differ from our estimates, we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income. 
  Goodwill  
  Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level. We perform an evaluation of goodwill, utilizing either a quantitative or qualitative impairment test, on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The annual test for impairment is conducted as of December 1. Our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as its operating segments. 
  Under a quantitative assessment, testing for impairment of goodwill is a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss. Fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach (75%) and a market approach (25%), as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. 
  Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. The estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit are based on internally generated forecasts for the remainder of the respective reporting period and the next six years. We use a 3.5% long-term assumed consolidated annual net sales growth rate for periods after the six-year forecast. 
  Under the market approach, we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for guideline companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company. The valuation multiples are applied to the reporting units. 
  Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including net sales growth rates, gross margins, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. Any changes in the judgments, estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results. 
  Under a qualitative assessment, the most recent quantitative assessment is the starting point to determine if it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s goodwill is impaired. As part of this qualitative assessment, we assess relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in share price and entity-specific events. 
  December 1, 2015 Impairment Analysis 
  We completed our annual impairment analysis as of December 1, 2015 by utilizing a qualitative assessment for all reporting units. We determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. As a result of this determination, the quantitative two-step impairment analysis was deemed unnecessary.

   December 1, 2014 Impairment Analysis 
  We performed our annual impairment analysis as of December 1, 2014 by utilizing a quantitative assessment for all reporting units. Each reporting unit passed the first step of the analysis, and accordingly, we were not required to perform the second step of the analysis. The estimated fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Information regarding our 2014 impairment analysis is as follows: 

Intangible assets 
  Intangible assets include customer relationships, trade names, internally developed software and other intangibles. Intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. These intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value. In addition, each quarter, we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each of these intangible assets. If we were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary, then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. 
  During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we concluded our intangible assets with determinable lives were not impaired and no significant changes to the remaining useful lives were necessary. 
  Income Taxes 
  Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. This evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors, such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. 
  We account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

   Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risks 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates. The interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, our senior secured term loan facility, and the Kelway term loan are floating and, therefore, are subject to fluctuations. In order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility, we have entered into interest rate caps to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
  As of   December 31, 2015   we have twenty interest rate cap agreements in effect through January 14, 2017 with a combined notional amount of $1,400.0 million which entitle us to payments from the counterparty of the amount, if any, by which three-month LIBOR exceeds 2.0% during the agreement period. For additional details, see   Note 8     (Long-Term Debt)   to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations  for information on cash flows, interest rates and maturity dates of our debt obligations. 
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  We transact business in foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian dollar and the British pound, which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Revenue and expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currencies of the corresponding countries. The functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the same as the corresponding local currency. Upon consolidation, as results of operations are translated, operating results may differ from expectations. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has not been material as the majority of our results of operations are denominated in U.S. dollars.

    Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     Description of Business 
  CDW Corporation ( Parent ) is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ( IT ) solutions to small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers in North America and the United Kingdom. The Company s offerings range from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration. 
  Throughout this report, the terms  the Company  and  CDW  refer to Parent and its 100% owned subsidiaries. 
  Parent has two 100% owned subsidiaries, CDW LLC and CDW Finance Corporation. CDW LLC is an Illinois limited liability company that, together with its 100% owned subsidiaries, holds all material assets and conducts all business activities and operations of the Company. CDW Finance Corporation is a Delaware corporation formed for the sole purpose of acting as co-issuer of certain debt obligations as described in   Note 17     (Supplemental Guarantor Information)   and does not hold any material assets or engage in any business activities or operations. 
  On August 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Kelway TopCo Limited ( Kelway ) by purchasing the remaining   65%   of its outstanding common stock which increased the Company s ownership interest from   35%   to   100%  , and provided the Company control. For further details regarding the acquisition, see   Note 3     (Acquisition)  . 
  CDW Corporation was previously owned directly by CDW Holdings LLC ( CDW Holdings ), a company controlled by investment funds affiliated with Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC ( Madison Dearborn ) and Providence Equity Partners L.L.C. ( Providence Equity ), certain other co-investors and certain members of CDW management. On October 12, 2007, CDW Corporation was acquired through a merger transaction by an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity (the  Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity Acquisition ).  
  On July 2, 2013, Parent completed an initial public offering ( IPO ) of its common stock. In connection with the IPO, CDW Holdings distributed all of its shares of Parent s common stock to its members in June 2013 in accordance with the members  respective membership interests and was subsequently dissolved in August 2013. For additional discussion of the IPO, see   Note 10     (Stockholders  Equity)  . 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Parent and its 100% owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Business Combinations 
  The Company accounts for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions. The Company may utilize third-party valuation specialists to assist the  
     61 

     Table of Contents  
  CDW CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

   Company in the allocation. Initial purchase price allocations are subject to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related expenses and transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents include all deposits in banks and short-term (original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase), highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near maturity that there is insignificant risk of changes in value due to interest rate changes. 
  Accounts Receivable 
  Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and typically do not bear interest. The Company provides allowances for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company takes into consideration the overall quality of the receivable portfolio along with specifically-identified customer risks. 
  Merchandise Inventory 
  Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined using a weighted-average cost method. Price protection is recorded when earned as a reduction to the cost of inventory. The Company decreases the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value, based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand, specifically known inventory-related risks, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
  Miscellaneous Receivables 
  Miscellaneous receivables generally consist of amounts due from vendors. The Company receives incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising, volume rebates, bid programs, price protection and other programs. These incentives generally relate to written vendor agreements with specified performance requirements and are recorded as adjustments to Cost of sales or Merchandise inventory, depending on the nature of the incentive. 
  Property and Equipment  
  Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The Company calculates depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the initial lease term. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows: 
                 Classification 
    Estimated 
  Useful Lives 
      Machinery and equipment 
    5 to 10 years 
      Building and leasehold improvements 
    4 to 25 years 
      Computer and data processing equipment 
    3 to 5 years 
      Computer software 
    3 to 5 years 
      Furniture and fixtures 
    4 to 10 years 

The Company has asset retirement obligations associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to its original condition upon lease termination. The Company s asset retirement liability was   $1.8 million   and   $0.5 million   as of   December 31, 2015 and 2014  , respectively.  
  Equity Investments 
  If the Company is not required to consolidate its investment in another entity because it does not have control, the Company uses the equity method if it (i) can exercise significant influence over the other entity and (ii) holds common stock of the other entity. Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost, plus or minus the Company s share of equity in the increases and decreases in the investee s net assets after the date of acquisition and adjustments for basis differences. The Company s share of the net income or loss of equity method investees is included in Other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

   Goodwill 
  The Company performs an evaluation of goodwill, utilizing either a quantitative or qualitative impairment test, on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The annual test for impairment is conducted as of December 1. The Company s reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as its operating segments.  
  Under a quantitative assessment, testing for impairment of goodwill is a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss. Fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach (  75%  ) and a market approach (  25%  ), as this combination is considered the most indicative of the Company s fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants.  
  Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. The estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit is based on internally generated forecasts for the remainder of the respective reporting period and the next   six   years. The Company uses a   3.5%   long-term assumed consolidated annual net sales growth rate for periods after the six-year forecast. 
  Under the market approach, the Company utilizes valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for guideline companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company. The valuation multiples are applied to the reporting units.  
  Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including net sales growth rates, gross margins, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. Any changes in the judgments, estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results.  
  Under a qualitative assessment, the most recent quantitative assessment is the starting point to determine if it is more- likely-than-not that the reporting unit s goodwill is impaired. As part of this qualitative assessment, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in share price and entity-specific events. 
  Intangible Assets 
  Intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. The cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value. In addition, each quarter, the Company evaluates whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each of these intangible assets. If the Company were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary, then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. 
  The following table shows estimated useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets: 
                 Classification 
    Estimated  
  Useful Lives 
      Customer relationships and contracts

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

   Deferred Financing Costs 
  Deferred financing costs, such as underwriting, financial advisory, professional fees and other similar fees are capitalized and recognized in Interest expense, net over the estimated life of the related debt instrument using the effective interest method or straight-line method, as applicable. The Company classifies deferred financing costs as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the long-term debt liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, except for deferred financing costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements which are presented as an asset, included within  Other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  Derivatives 
  The Company has entered into interest rate cap agreements for the purpose of economically hedging its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivatives are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  The Company s interest rate cap agreements are not designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded directly to Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value is defined under GAAP as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs to prioritize the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: 
  Level 1   observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 
  Level 2   inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
  Level 3   inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in Stockholders  equity under Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
  The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows: 

Revenue Recognition 
  The Company is a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers, including original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), software publishers and wholesale distributors. The Company records revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company s shipping terms typically specify F.O.B. destination, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. 
  Revenues from the sales of hardware products and software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales. These items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways, including (i) as physical product shipped from the Company s warehouse, (ii) via drop-shipment by the vendor or supplier, or (iii) via electronic delivery for software  
     64 

     Table of Contents  
  CDW CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

   licenses. At the time of sale, the Company records an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience. The Company s vendor partners warrant most of the products the Company sells. 
  The Company leverages drop-shipment arrangements with many of its vendors and suppliers to deliver products to its customers without having to physically hold the inventory at its warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. The Company recognizes revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify F.O.B. destination. 
  Revenue from professional services is either recognized as provided for services billed at an hourly rate, recognized using a percentage of completion model for fixed fee project work or recognized using a proportional performance model for services provided at a fixed fee. Revenue from cloud computing solutions including Software as a Service ( SaaS ) and Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) arrangements, as well as data center services such as managed and remote managed services, server co-location, internet connectivity and data backup and storage, is recognized over the period service is provided. 
  The Company also sells certain products for which it acts as an agent. Products in this category include the sale of third-party services, warranties, software assurance ( SA ) and third-party hosted SaaS and IaaS arrangements. SA is a product that allows customers to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the SA is in effect. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition, and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale. Under net sales recognition, the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction. 
  The Company s larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of its vendors to purchase software licenses and SA under enterprise agreements ( EAs ). Under EAs, customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year, regardless of changes to their employee base. Customers are charged an annual true-up fee for changes in the number of users over the year. With most EAs, the Company s vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly, paying resellers such as the Company an agency fee or commission on these sales. The Company records these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount. In certain instances, the Company bills the customer directly under an EA and accounts for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item. The Company s vendors typically dictate how the EA will be sold to the customer. 
  The Company also sells some of its products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables, which may include a combination of products and services. For each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting, total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element. The allocated arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above. Selling prices are determined by using vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) if it exists. Otherwise, selling prices are determined using third-party evidence ( TPE ). If neither VSOE or TPE is available, the Company uses its best estimate of selling prices. 
  The Company records freight billed to its customers as Net sales and the related freight costs as a Cost of sales. 
  Deferred revenue includes (1) payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services and (2) amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met. 
  The Company performs an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales in-transit to customers at the end of each period based on a weighted-average analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes drop-shipment arrangements. This analysis is the basis upon which the Company estimates the amount of sales in-transit at the end of the period and adjusts revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been received by the customer. Changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on the Company s revenue recognition for the period. 
  Sales Taxes 
  Sales tax amounts collected from customers for remittance to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Advertising 
  Advertising costs are generally charged to expense in the period incurred. Cooperative reimbursements from vendors are recorded in the period the related advertising expenditure is incurred. The Company classifies vendor consideration as a reduction to Cost of sales. 
     65 

     Table of Contents  
  CDW CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

   Equity-Based Compensation 
  The Company measures all equity-based payments using a fair-value-based method and records compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimated forfeiture rates have been developed based upon historical experience. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense is typically recognized in the period incurred at the applicable interest rate in effect.  
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  The Company s functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company s international operating subsidiaries is generally the same as the corresponding local currency. Assets and liabilities of the international operating subsidiaries are translated at the spot rate in effect at the applicable reporting date. Revenues and expenses of the international operating subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is reflected as a separate component of Stockholders  equity. 
  Income Taxes 
  Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company performs an evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. This evaluation requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors, such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. 
  The Company accounts for unrecognized tax benefits based upon its assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to its unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. 
             2. 
    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
     Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, simplifying the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes by requiring all deferred taxes, along with any related valuation allowance, to be presented as noncurrent. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2017, allows for early adoption and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments in a Business Combination 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, eliminating the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2016, allows for early adoption and must be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts occurring after the effective date. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-16 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and applied the new guidance to the measurement period adjustments recognized during the fourth quarter of 2015.

  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, amending the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value instead of the lower of cost or market value. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter

   of 2017, allows for early adoption and must be applied prospectively after the date of adoption. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Debt Issuance Costs 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, amending the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring deferred financing costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for deferred financing costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2016, allows for early adoption permitted and requires retrospective application to all prior periods. 
  The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 in the second quarter of 2015. As of June 30, 2015, the Company classified deferred financing costs as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the long-term debt liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, as of June 30, 2015, the Company retroactively adjusted the deferred financing costs and long-term debt liability presented as of December 31, 2014 by reducing the long-term debt liability by the amount of the deferred financing costs and eliminating the presentation of deferred financing costs as an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting  (SEC Update), clarifying the SEC s views on the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. The ASU allows for an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangements. This ASU is effective upon issuance and the Company adopted it in the third quarter of 2015. As of September 30, 2015, the Company classified deferred financing costs related to the Senior Secured Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility as an asset, included within Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company retroactively adjusted the deferred financing costs and long-term debt liability presented as of December 31, 2014 to align it to the presentation required by ASU 2015-15. 
  These adjustments had no impact on Net income, Comprehensive income, total Stockholders  equity cash flows, or Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure defined in the Company s credit agreement. The Company has determined the adjustments are not material either individually or in aggregate to any of its previously issued Consolidated Financial Statements. A summary of the revisions to the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014 is as follows: 

Revenue Recognition 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), replacing most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP and eliminating industry specific guidance. The core principal of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods and services equal to an amount it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods and services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, deferring the effective date by one year. This ASU will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018, allows for early adoption in the first quarter of 2017 and may be applied using either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact this ASU will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Acquisition 
     On   August 1, 2015  , the Company completed the acquisition of Kelway by purchasing the remaining   65%   of its outstanding common stock which increased the Company s ownership interest from   35%   to   100%  , and provided the Company control.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

   Kelway is a U.K.-based IT solutions provider which has cross-border supply chain relationships that enable it to conduct business in   more than 80 countries  .  
  A summary of the total consideration transferred is as follows: 

(1) 
    The Company issued   1.6 million   shares of CDW common stock. The fair value of the common stock was based on the closing market price on   July 31, 2015  , adjusted for the lack of marketability as the shares of CDW common stock issued to certain sellers are subject to a   three  -year lock up restriction from   August 1, 2015  . One of the sellers granted   0.6 million   stock options to certain Kelway coworkers over his shares of CDW common stock received in the transaction. The fair value of these stock options was   $21.8 million  , which has been accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation and is being amortized over the weighted-average requisite service period of   3.2   years and recorded in Selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
              (2) 
    As a result of the Company obtaining control over Kelway, the Company s previously held   35%   equity investment was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of   $98.1 million   included in Gain on remeasurement of equity investment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the previously held equity investment was determined by management with the assistance of a third party valuation firm, based on information available at the acquisition date. 
     Transaction-related costs associated with this acquisition of   $5.8 million   during the year ended   December 31, 2015   were expensed as incurred and included in Selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  The recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, translated using the foreign currency exchange rates on the date of acquisition, are as follows:

            (1) 
    The fair values assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. These fair values are subject to change within the measurement period. In the   fourth   quarter of   2015  , the Company recorded a reduction of   $8.6 million   to goodwill, primarily related to adjustments to taxes, merchandise inventory and deferred revenue. 
              (2) 
    Details of the identified intangible assets acquired are as follows: 

(3) 
    Accounts payable includes both Accounts payable-trade and Accounts payable-inventory financing. 
     Goodwill in the amount of   $305.2 million   was recognized in the acquisition of Kelway and is attributable to the business from new customers and the value of the acquired assembled workforce. The goodwill was allocated to the Kelway operating segment which is included with CDW Advanced Services and Canada in an all other category ( Other ). The full amount of goodwill recognized is not deductible for income tax purposes in the United Kingdom. 
  For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , net sales and net income of Kelway included in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations from the date of acquisition were   $350.7 million   and   $8.6 million  , respectively. 
  The unaudited pro forma Consolidated Statements of Operations in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of the Company and Kelway, as if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2014, and gives effect to pro forma events that are factually supportable and directly attributable to the transaction.

Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Loan inventory financing agreement are unsecured and non-interest bearing. 
  The Company also maintains other inventory financing agreements with financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from certain vendors. As of   December 31, 2015 and 2014  , amounts owed under other inventory financing agreements were   $12.6 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively, of which   $1.2 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively, were collateralized by the inventory purchased under these financing agreements and a second lien on the related accounts receivable.

    Long-Term Debt 
     Long-term debt as of December 31, 2015 is as follows: 

(1) 
    As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-03 during the second quarter of 2015, historical periods have been revised to reflect the change in the presentation of deferred financing costs, which are now shown as a reduction of long-term debt, instead of being presented as a separate asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company adopted ASU 2015-15 which allows entities to present deferred financing costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset. As of December 31, 2015, the Company classified deferred financing costs related to the Senior Secured Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility as an asset, included within Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company retroactively adjusted the deferred financing costs and long term liability presented as of December 31, 2014 to align it to the current period presentation. There are no deferred financing costs related to the Kelway revolving credit facility. For additional information, see Note 2 (Recent Accounting Pronouncements). 
      As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company remained in compliance with the covenants under its various credit agreements. Under the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, there are restrictions on the ability of CDW to pay dividends, make share repurchases, redeem subordinated debt and engage in certain other transactions. At    December 31, 2015  , the amount of CDW s restricted payment capacity under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility was   $679.7 million  , however the Company is separately permitted to make restricted payments so long as the total net leverage ratio is less than   3.25   on a pro forma basis. The total net leverage ratio was   3.0   at December 31, 2015. 
  Senior Secured Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility ( Revolving Loan ) 
  At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Loan,   $2.1 million   of undrawn letters of credit and   $404.9 million   reserved related to the floorplan sub-facility.

       Table of Contents  
  CDW CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

   On June 6, 2014, the Company entered into the Revolving Loan, a new five-year   $1,250.0 million   senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, with the facility being available to the Company for borrowings, issuance of letters of credit and floorplan financing for certain vendor products. The Revolving Loan matures on June 6, 2019, subject to an acceleration provision discussed below. The Revolving Loan replaced the Company s previous revolving loan credit facility that was to mature on June 24, 2016. The Revolving Loan (i) increased the overall revolving credit facility capacity available to the Company from   $900.0 million   to   $1,250.0 million  , (ii) increased the maximum aggregate amount of increases that may be made to the revolving credit facility from   $200.0 million   to   $300.0 million  , (iii) maintained a maturity acceleration provision based upon excess cash availability whereby the Revolving Loan may mature   45   days prior to the final maturity of any then outstanding senior debt if excess cash availability does not exceed the outstanding borrowings of the subject maturing debt at the time of the test plus   $150.0 million  , (iv) decreased the fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility from either   37.5   or   50   basis points, depending on the amount of utilization, to   25   basis points, (v) decreased the applicable interest rate margin by 50 basis points, and (vi) amended the existing inventory floorplan sub-facility as discussed below. In connection with the termination of the previous facility, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of   $0.4 million   in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing a write-off of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs. Fees of   $6.4 million   related to the Revolving Loan were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the five-year term of the facility on a straight-line basis.  
  The Revolving Loan incorporates the previous inventory floorplan sub-facility and related Revolving Loan inventory financing agreement while removing the previous   $400.0 million   limit on the size of the floorplan sub-facility and the in-transit reserve of   15.0%   of open orders. At   December 31, 2015  , the financial intermediary reported an outstanding balance of   $415.6 million   under the Revolving Loan inventory financing agreement. The amount included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   December 31, 2015   as Accounts payable-inventory financing related to the Revolving Loan inventory financing agreement of   $427.0 million   includes   $11.4 million   for amounts in transit.  
  Borrowings under the Revolving Loan bear interest at a variable interest rate plus an applicable margin. The interest rate margin is based on one of two indices, either (i) LIBOR, or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR ) with the ABR being the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus   50   basis points or (c) the one-month LIBOR plus   1.00%  . The applicable margin varies (  1.50%   to   2.00%   for LIBOR borrowings and   0.50%   to   1.00%   for ABR borrowings) depending upon average daily excess cash availability under the agreement evidencing the Revolving Loan and is subject to a reduction of   0.25%   if, and for as long as, CDW LLC s corporate credit rating from Standard   Poor s Rating Services is BB or better and CDW LLC s corporate family rating from Moody s Investors Service, Inc. is Ba3 or better (in each case with stable or better outlook). 
  Under the Revolving Loan, the Company is permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of   $1,250.0 million  ; however, its ability to borrow under the Revolving Loan is limited by a borrowing base. The borrowing base is (a) the sum of the products of the applicable advance rates on eligible accounts receivable and on eligible inventory as defined in the agreement less (b) any reserves. At   December 31, 2015  , the borrowing base was   $1,423.1 million   based on the amount of eligible inventory and accounts receivable balances as of November 30, 2015. The Company could have borrowed up to an additional   $843.1 million   under the Revolving Loan at   December 31, 2015  .  
  The ability to borrow under the Revolving Loan also remains limited by a minimum liquidity condition which provides that, if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of (i)   $125.0 million   and (ii) the greater of (A)   10.0%   of the borrowing base and (B)   $100.0 million  , the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under the Revolving Loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as described in the agreement evidencing the Revolving Loan) is at least   1.00   to   1.00  . 
  CDW LLC is the borrower under the Revolving Loan. All obligations under the Revolving Loan are guaranteed by Parent and each of CDW LLC s direct and indirect, 100% owned, domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings under the Revolving Loan are collateralized by a first priority interest in inventory (excluding inventory collateralized under the inventory floorplan arrangements as described in   Note 6     (Inventory Financing Agreements)   deposits, and accounts receivable, and a second priority interest in substantially all other assets. The Revolving Loan contains negative covenants that, among other things, place restrictions and limitations on the ability of Parent and each of CDW LLC s direct and indirect, 100% owned, domestic subsidiaries to dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, incur guarantee obligations, prepay other indebtedness, make distributions or other restricted payments, create liens, make equity or debt investments, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Revolving Loan also includes maintenance of a minimum average daily excess cash availability requirement. Should the Company fall below the minimum average daily excess cash availability requirement for five consecutive business days, the Company  
     75 

       Table of Contents

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

   becomes subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio until such time as the daily excess cash availability requirement is met for 30 consecutive business days. 
  Senior Secured Term Loan Facility ( Term Loan ) 
  On April 29, 2013, the Company entered into the Term Loan, a seven-year,   $1,350.0 million   aggregate principal amount senior secured term loan facility. The Term Loan was issued at a price that was   99.75%   of par, which resulted in a discount of   $3.4 million  . Substantially all of the proceeds from the Term Loan were used to repay the   $1,299.5 million   outstanding aggregate principal amount of the prior senior secured term loan facility (the  Prior Term Loan Facility ). In connection with this refinancing, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of   $10.3 million   in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. This loss represented a write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs related to the Prior Term Loan Facility.  
  On July 31, 2013, the Company borrowed an additional   $190.0 million   aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan at a price that was   99.25%   of par, which resulted in a discount of   $1.4 million  . Such proceeds were used to redeem a portion of outstanding 12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017. The discounts are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a reduction to the face amount of the Term Loan and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt. Fees of   $6.1 million   related to the Term Loan were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the term of the facility using the effective interest method. 
  The Company is required to pay quarterly principal installments equal to   0.25%   of the original principal amount of the Term Loan, with the remaining principal amount payable on the maturity date of April 29, 2020. The quarterly principal installment payments commenced during the quarter ended June 30, 2013. At   December 31, 2015  , the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan was   $1,498.1 million  , excluding   $6.7 million   of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs.  
  Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at either (a) the alternate base rate ( ABR ) plus a margin or (b) LIBOR plus a margin; provided that for the purposes of the Term Loan, LIBOR shall not be less than   1.00%   per annum at any time ( LIBOR Floor ), payable quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September, and December. The margin is based upon a net leverage ratio as defined in the agreement governing the Term Loan, ranging from   1.25%   to   1.50%   for ABR borrowings and   2.25%   to   2.50%   for LIBOR borrowings. The total net leverage ratio was   3.0   at   December 31, 2015  . As defined in the Company s credit agreement, the total net leverage ratio is calculated, on a consolidated basis, as the ratio of total debt at period-end excluding any unamortized discount and/or premium and unamortized deferred financing costs, less cash and cash equivalents, to trailing twelve months ( TTM ) adjusted earnings before taxes, interest expense, and depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ), a non-GAAP measure defined in the Company s credit agreement. The Term Loan calculates Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing twelve month basis, which includes twelve months of Kelway s results on a pro forma basis. An interest rate of   3.25%  , LIBOR Floor plus a   2.25%   margin, was in effect during the three-month period ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  In order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under the Term Loan, the Company maintains interest rate cap agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company entered into   fourteen   interest rate cap agreements at a rate of   2.0%   with a combined notional amount of   $1,000.0 million  . Under the 2014 agreements, the Company made premium payments totaling   $2.1 million   to the counterparties in exchange for the right to receive payments equal to the amount, if any, by which three-month LIBOR exceeds   2.0%   during the agreement period. During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company entered into   six   interest rate cap agreements at a rate of   2.0%   with a combined notional amount of   $400.0 million  . Under the 2015 agreements, the Company made premium payments totaling   $0.5 million   to the counterparties in exchange for the right to receive payments equal to the amount, if any, by which the three-month LIBOR exceeds   2.0%   during the agreement period. These interest rate cap agreements are effective from January 14, 2015 through January 14, 2017. The fair value of the Company s interest rate cap agreements was   $0.1 million   and   $1.7 million   at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

    Equity-Based Compensation 
     Equity-based compensation expense, which is recorded in Selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, for the years ended   December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013   is as follows: 

(1) 
    Includes pre-tax expense of   $36.7 million   related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards granted prior to the Company s IPO. All unvested awards granted pursuant to the MPK Coworker Incentive Plan II (the  MPK Plan ) vested in connection with the IPO as discussed further below in the section labeled  MPK II Units.  
     The total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards was   $57.9 million   at   December 31, 2015   and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.2   years. 
  2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
  The 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2013 LTIP ) provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, bonus stock and performance awards. The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2013 LTIP is   11,700,000   shares of the Company s common stock, in addition to the   3,798,508   shares of restricted stock granted in exchange for unvested Class B Common Units in connection with the Company s IPO, as discussed under  Pre-IPO Equity Awards.  As of   December 31, 2015  ,   5,636,925   shares were available for issuance under the 2013 LTIP which was approved by the Company s pre-IPO shareholders. Authorized but unissued shares are reserved for issuance in connection with equity-based awards. 
  Stock Options 
  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company granted   936,865   stock options under the 2013 LTIP. These options vest annually over   three   years and have a contractual term of   10   years. The exercise price of a stock option is equal to the fair value of a share of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend yield. The weighted-average assumptions used to value the stock options granted during the years ended   December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013   are as follows: 

(1) 
    Based upon an assessment of the two-year, five-year and implied volatility for the Company s selected peer group, adjusted for the Company s leverage. 
              (2) 
    Based on a composite U.S. Treasury rate. 
              (3) 
    Calculated using the simplified method, which defines the expected term as the average of the option s contractual term and the option s weighted-average vesting period. The Company utilizes this method as it has limited historical stock option data that is sufficient to derive a reasonable estimate of the expected stock option term.

Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ) 
  Restricted stock units represent the right to receive unrestricted shares of the Company s stock at the time of vesting. RSUs generally cliff-vest at the end of   four   years. 
  RSU activity for the year ended   December 31, 2015   is as follows: 

Performance Share Units ( PSUs ) 
  As of January 1, 2015, there were   411,580   PSUs outstanding at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of   $24.40  . During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company granted   195,622   PSUs under the 2013 LTIP which cliff-vest at the end of   3   years. The percentage of PSUs that shall vest will range from   0%   to   200%   of the number of PSUs granted based on the Company s performance against a cumulative adjusted free cash flow measure and cumulative non-GAAP net income per diluted share measure over a three-year performance period. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the PSUs granted during the period was   $37.83   per unit. During the year ended   December 31, 2015  ,   28,607   PSUs were forfeited at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of   $28.76  . As of   December 31, 2015  ,   578,595   PSUs were outstanding at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of   $28.67  . During the years ended   December 31, 2015 and 2014  ,   no   units vested.

  Restricted Stock 
  In connection with the IPO, CDW Holdings distributed all of its shares of the Company s common stock to its existing members in accordance with their respective membership interests. Common stock received by holders of Class B Common Units in connection with the distribution is subject to any vesting provisions previously applicable to the holder s Class B Common Units. Class B Common Unit holders received   3,798,508   shares of restricted stock with respect to Class B Common Units that had not yet vested at the time of the distribution. As of January 1, 2015, there were   260,514   shares of restricted stock outstanding. For the year ended   December 31, 2015  ,   165,697   shares of such restricted stock vested/settled and   2,789   shares were forfeited. As of   December 31, 2015  , there were   92,028   shares of unvested stock outstanding. The aggregate fair value of restricted stock that vested during the years ended   December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013   was   $2.8 million  ,   $39.5 million   and   $20.4 million  , respectively.  
  Equity Awards Granted by Seller of Kelway 
  The Company issued   1.6 million   shares of CDW common stock as part of the consideration transferred to certain sellers for the acquisition of Kelway. One of the sellers granted   0.6 million   stock options to certain Kelway coworkers over his shares of CDW common stock received in this transaction. The options are not dilutive for purposes of calculating diluted weighted-average shares outstanding as the underlying shares were issued as part of the consideration transferred and are included within basic weighted-average shares outstanding since the acquisition date. The weighted average grant date fair value of the stock options was   $21.8 million   or   $35.93   per option. The grant date fair value of the options was determined by calculating the fair value of the common stock that was issued which will eventually settle these options. The exercise price of these stock options is   $0.01  . The fair value of these stock options has been accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation, as service is required for the coworkers to retain the awards, and is being amortized over the weighted-average requisite service period.   No   options were forfeited or vested during the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Options that are forfeited prior to vesting will not be available for future option issuances and will revert as consideration to the seller. For further details regarding the acquisition, refer to   Note 3     (Acquisition)  . 
  Pre-IPO Equity Awards 
  Prior to the IPO, the Company had the following equity-based compensation plans in place: 
  Class B Common Units 
  The Board of Managers of CDW Holdings adopted the CDW Holdings LLC 2007 Incentive Equity Plan (the  Plan ) for coworkers, managers, consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Plan permitted a committee designated by the Board of Managers of CDW Holdings (the  Committee ) to grant or sell to any participant Class A Common Units or Class B Common Units of CDW Holdings in such quantity, at such price, on such terms and subject to such conditions that were consistent with the Plan and as established by the Committee. 
  The Class B Common Units that were granted vested daily on a pro rata basis between the date of grant and the fifth anniversary thereof and were subject to repurchase by, with respect to vested units, or forfeiture to, with respect to unvested units, the Company upon the coworker s separation from service as was set forth in each holder s Class B Common Unit Grant Agreement. 
  The grant date fair value of Class B Common Unit grants was calculated using the Option-Pricing Method. This method considered Class A Common Units and Class B Common Units as call options on the total equity value, giving consideration to liquidation preferences and conversion of the preferred units. Such Class A Common Units and Class B Common Units were modeled as call options that gave their owners the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying equity value at a predetermined (or exercise) price. Class B Common Units were considered to be call options with a claim on equity value at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the Class A Common Units and Class B Common Units with a lower participation threshold were liquidated. The Option-Pricing Method is highly sensitive to key assumptions, such as the volatility assumption. As such, the use of this method can be applied when the range of possible future outcomes is difficult to predict.

  Contemporaneous with the Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity Acquisition, the Company agreed with Michael P. Krasny, CDW Corporation founder, former chairman and CEO and significant selling shareholder, to establish the MPK Plan for the benefit of all of the coworkers of the Company other than members of senior management who received incentive equity awards under the Plan. 
  The MPK Plan established an  account  for each eligible participant which was notionally credited with a number of Class A Common Units of CDW Holdings LLC on October 15, 2007, the day the plan was established. The notional units credited to participants  accounts were to cliff-vest at the end of   ten   years, subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain events. Notional units granted under the MPK Plan were valued on the grant date at   $1,000   per unit, the fair value equivalent of the Class A Common Units at the time the awards were granted. 
  On July 2, 2013, the Company completed an IPO of its common shares. Under the terms of the MPK Plan, vesting accelerated for all unvested units upon completion of the IPO. The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of   $36.7 million   for compensation expense related to the acceleration of the expense recognition for MPK Plan units in the year ended December 31, 2013. In connection with the completion of the IPO, the Company distributed common stock to each participant and withheld the number of shares of common stock equal to the required tax withholding for each participant. The Company paid required withholding taxes of   $24.0 million   to federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. This amount is reported as a financing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash flows and as an increase to Accumulated deficit in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders  Equity for the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, the Company paid   $4.0 million   of employer payroll taxes that are included as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2013. 
  A summary of pre-IPO equity plan activity for the year ended December 31, 2013 is as follows: 

(1) 
    As discussed above, the Class B Common Units and MPK Plan Units were converted/settled into shares of the Company s common stock upon completion of the IPO. The converted Class B Common Units, to the extent unvested at the time of the IPO, relate to the grants of restricted stock disclosed above.  
     In connection with the establishment of the MPK Plan, the Company agreed to make charitable contributions in amounts equal to the net income tax benefits derived from payouts to participants under the MPK Plan (net of any related employer payroll tax costs). The contributions of these amounts were due by March 15 of the calendar year following the year in

   which the Company realized the benefits of the deductions. This arrangement has been accounted for as contingent consideration. Pre-2009 business combinations were accounted for under a former accounting standard which, among other aspects, precluded the recognition of certain contingent consideration as of the business combination date. Instead, under the former accounting standard, contingent consideration is accounted for as additional purchase price (goodwill) at the time the contingency is resolved. As of December 31, 2013, the Company accrued   $20.9 million   related to this arrangement within other current liabilities, as the Company realized the tax benefit of the compensation deductions during the 2013 tax year. The Company made the related cash contribution during the first quarter of 2014. 
     The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share is Net income. The denominator for basic earnings per share is the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period.  
  A reconciliation of basic weighted-average shares outstanding to diluted weighted-average shares outstanding is as follows: 

(1) 
    The 2013 basic weighted-average shares outstanding was impacted by common stock issued during the IPO and the underwriters  exercise in full of the overallotment option granted to them in connection with the IPO. As the common stock was issued on July 2, 2013 and July 31, 2013, respectively, the shares are only partially reflected in the 2013 basic weighted-average shares outstanding. Such shares are fully reflected in the 2015 and 2014 basic weighted-average shares outstanding. For additional discussion of the IPO, see   Note 10     (Stockholders  Equity)  . 
              (2) 
    The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock, Coworker Stock Purchase Plan units and MPK Plan units is reflected in the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method. 
              (3) 
    There were   0.4 million   potential common shares excluded from the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and there was an insignificant amount of potential common shares excluded from the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the years ended   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , as their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect. 
                13. 
    Coworker Retirement and Other Compensation Benefits 
     Profit Sharing Plan and Other Savings Plans 
  The Company has a profit sharing plan that includes a salary reduction feature established under the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) covering substantially all coworkers in the United States. In addition, coworkers outside the U.S. participate in other savings plans. Company contributions to the profit sharing and other savings plans are made in cash and determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors. For the years ended   December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013  , the amounts expensed for these plans were   $19.8 million  ,   $21.9 million   and   $17.3 million  , respectively. 
  Coworker Stock Purchase Plan 
  On January 1, 2014, the first offering period under the Company s Coworker Stock Purchase Plan (the  CSPP ) commenced. The CSPP provides the opportunity for eligible coworkers to acquire shares of the Company s common stock at a   5%   discount from the closing market price on the final day of the offering period. There is   no   compensation expense associated with the CSPP. 
  Restricted Debt Unit Plan 
  On March 10, 2010, the Company established the Restricted Debt Unit Plan (the  RDU Plan ), an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

   Compensation expense related to the RDU Plan was   $4.6 million  ,   $8.8 million   and   $16.8 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013  , respectively. At   December 31, 2015 and 2014  , the Company had   $35.0 million   and   $30.4 million   of liabilities related to the RDU Plan recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. 
  Unrecognized compensation expense as of December 31, 2015 of approximately   $1.7 million   is expected to be recognized in 2016 and approximately   $1.3 million   in 2017. Payments under the RDU Plan may be impacted if certain significant events occur or circumstances change that would impact the financial condition or structure of the Company. Payment of the principal component of the RDU Plan is expected to be made on October 12, 2017. 
    14.      Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company is party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business, which include commercial, intellectual property, employment, tort and other litigation matters. The Company is also subject to audit by federal, state, international, national, provincial and local authorities, and by various partners, group purchasing organizations and customers, including government agencies, relating to purchases and sales under various contracts. In addition, the Company is subject to indemnification claims under various contracts. From time to time, certain customers of the Company file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the U.S. bankruptcy laws or similar laws of the jurisdictions for the Company s business activities outside of the United States. In such cases, certain pre-petition payments received by the Company could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator. 
  On October 29, 2015, the Company received a request for production of documents in connection with an investigation by the SEC of the Company s vendor partner program incentives. The Company has produced documents to the SEC and is continuing to cooperate with the SEC in this matter. 
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters, if any, has been incurred. However, the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable. As such, the Company s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters. 
    15.      Related Party Transactions 
  During 2015 and 2014, the Company held a   35%   non-controlling interest in Kelway until August 1, 2015 when the Company purchased the remaining   65%   of its outstanding common stock. The Company recorded   $9.9 million   in net sales to Kelway during the normal course of business in 2015 prior to the acquisition of Kelway. Net sales to Kelway during the period in 2014 in which the Company held Kelway as an equity investment were not significant. 
  On   November 30, 2015  , the Company completed a public offering of   9.2 million   shares of its common stock by certain selling stockholders, which included   1.2 million   shares sold by the selling stockholders to the underwriters pursuant to the grant of an option that was exercised in full. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares. Upon completion of this offering, the Company purchased from the underwriters   1.0 million   of the shares of its common stock that were subject to the offering at a price per share equal to the price paid by the underwriters to the selling stockholders in the offering.

The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares. Upon completion of this offering, the Company purchased from the underwriters   2.3 million   of the shares of its common stock that were subject to the offering at a price per share equal to the price paid by the underwriters to the selling stockholders in the offering. 
  On   May 22, 2015  , the Company completed a public offering of   11.5 million   shares of its common stock by certain selling stockholders, which included   1.5 million   shares sold by the selling stockholders to the underwriters pursuant to the grant of an option that was exercised in full. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares. On   May 17, 2015  , the Company entered into a share repurchase agreement with certain selling stockholders affiliated with Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity pursuant to which it repurchased   2.0 million   shares of its common stock from such selling stockholders. This share repurchase was effected in a private, non-underwritten transaction for   $36.60   per share, which was equal to the per share price paid by the underwriters to the selling stockholders in connection with the public offering completed on   May 22, 2015  .

   On March 20, 2014, the Company repurchased and subsequently canceled   $25.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes from an affiliate of Providence Equity. For additional information, see   Note 8     (Long-Term Debt)  . 
  On July 2, 2013, the Company completed an IPO of its common stock. Using a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO, the Company paid a   $24.4 million   termination fee to affiliates of the Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity in connection with the termination of the management services agreement with such entities that was effective upon completion of the IPO. The Company paid an annual management fee of   $2.5 million   in the year ended December 31, 2013. There were   no   management fees paid for the years ended   December 31, 2015 and 2014  .  
  Prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company had previously entered into a management services agreement with Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity pursuant to which they had agreed to provide it with management and consulting services and financial and other advisory services. Pursuant to such agreement, Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity received an annual management fee of   $5.0 million   and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the provision of such services. Such amounts were classified as Selling and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The management services agreement included customary indemnification and provisions in favor of Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity. 
    16.      Segment Information 
  The Company s segment information is presented in accordance with a  management approach,  which designates the internal reporting used by the chief operating decision-maker for deciding how to allocate resources and for assessing performance.  
  The Company has   two   reportable segments: Corporate, which is comprised primarily of private sector business customers, and Public, which is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions. The Company also has   three   other operating segments: CDW Advanced Services; Canada; and Kelway, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ( Other ). For additional information relating to Kelway, see Note 3 (Acquisition).  
  The Company has centralized logistics and headquarters functions that provide services to the segments. The logistics function includes purchasing, distribution and fulfillment services to support both the Corporate and Public segments. As a result, costs and intercompany charges associated with the logistics function are fully allocated to both of these segments based on a percent of Net sales. The centralized headquarters function provides services in areas such as accounting, information technology, marketing, legal and coworker services. Headquarters  function costs that are not allocated to the segments are included under the heading of  Headquarters  in the tables below.  
  The Company allocates resources to and evaluates performance of its segments based on Net sales, Income from operations and Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure as defined in the Company s credit agreements. However, the Company has concluded that Income from operations is the more useful measure in terms of discussion of operating results, as it is a GAAP measure. 
  Segment information for Total assets and capital expenditures is not presented, as such information is not used in measuring segment performance or allocating resources between segments.

   Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, and that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. 
  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Management based this assessment on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013 framework).   
  Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
  On August 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Kelway TopCo Limited ( Kelway ) by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased the registrant's ownership interest from 35% to 100% and provided the registrant control. Management has excluded this acquisition from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2015. Kelway represented   $897.5 million   of total assets as of December 31, 2015 and   $350.7 million   and   $8.6 million   of net sales and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.  
  Ernst   Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and the Company s internal control over financial reporting and has included their reports herein. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Except as noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CDW Corporation 
    
  We have audited CDW Corporation and subsidiaries  internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). CDW Corporation and subsidiaries  management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  As indicated in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Kelway TopCo Limited, which is included in the 2015     consolidated financial statements of CDW Corporation and subsidiaries and constituted $898 million of total assets as of December 31, 2015 and $351 million and $9 million of net sales and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of     CDW Corporation and subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Kelway TopCo Limited. 
  In our opinion, CDW Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria. 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of CDW Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of CDW Corporation and subsidiaries and our report dated February 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

All debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company and the Member shall not be obligated personally for any such debt, obligation or liability of the Company solely by reason of being a member. 
  2.4      Power to Bind the Company  .  The Member (acting in its capacity as such) shall have the authority to bind the Company to any third party with respect to any matter. 
  2.5      Management  .  The management, operation and policy of the Company shall be vested exclusively in the Member.  The Member, acting through its duly authorized agents, is authorized and empowered on behalf and in the name of the Company to perform all acts and engage in all activities and transactions which it may in its sole discretion deem necessary or advisable in order to cause the Company to carry out its purpose and exercise the powers granted to the Company hereunder and under the Act.

ARTICLE III 
  Officers    
    
  3.1      Designation of Officers  .  The Member may, from time to time, designate one or more individuals to be officers of and to act for the Company.  No officer need be a resident of the State of Wisconsin.  Any officers so designated shall have such authority and perform such duties as the Member may, from time to time, prescribe or as may be provided in this Agreement, including the power to execute documents on behalf of the Company subject to the limits set forth herein.  The Member may assign titles to particular officers.  Unless the Member otherwise specifies, if the title is one commonly used for officers of a business corporation, the assignment of such title shall constitute the delegation to such officer of the authority, duties and ability to bind the Company that are normally associated with that office under the laws of the State of Wisconsin, subject to any specific limitations on authority and duties made to such officer by the Member pursuant to this   Section 3.1  .  Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor shall be duly designated and shall qualify or until his or her death or until he or she shall resign or shall have been removed.  Any number of offices may be held by the same individual.   
  3.2      Resignation; Removal  .  Any officer may resign as such at any time. Such resignation shall be made in writing and shall take effect at the time specified therein, or if no time be specified, at the time of its receipt by the Member.  Any officer may be removed as such, either with or without cause, by the Member; provided that such removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the individual so removed.  Designation of an officer shall not of itself create any contract rights, except as otherwise set forth herein.  Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Company may be filled by the Member. 
  3.3      Duties of Officers Generally  .  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each officer shall owe to the Company and its Member the same fiduciary duties (including the duties of care and loyalty) that such individuals would owe to a Wisconsin corporation and its shareholders as an officer thereof. 
  3.4      Appointed Officers  .  In addition to officers designated by the Member in accordance with this   Article III  , the Chief Executive Officer may appoint other officers below the level of Member-appointed Vice President as the Chief Executive Officer may from time to time deem expedient and may designate for such officers titles that appropriately reflect their positions and responsibilities.  Such appointed officers shall have such powers and shall perform such duties as may be assigned to them by the Chief Executive Officer or the senior officer to whom they report, consistent with corporate policies.  An appointed officer shall serve until the earlier of such officer s resignation or such officer s removal by the Chief Executive Officer at any time, either with or without cause. 
  ARTICLE IV 
  Capital Structure and Contributions 
  4.1      Capital Structure and Contributions  .   
  (a) The capital structure of the Company shall consist of one class of common units (the "  Common Units  ").  All Common Units shall be identical with each other in every respect.  The Common Units are the Member s share of the Company s profits, losses and distributions pursuant to this Agreement and the Act, and the Member s right to participate in the management or affairs of the Company, including the right to vote on, consent to or otherwise participate in any decision of the Members.  The Member shall own all of the Common Units issued and outstanding, as set forth on   Schedule A   attached hereto.  The Board may in its discretion issue certificates to the Member representing the Common Units held by such Member.  The Member hereby agrees that the Common Units shall be securities governed by Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Wisconsin (and Uniform Commercial Code of any other applicable jurisdiction.) 
  (b) The Member shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, to make any optional contributions to the capital of the Company in the form of cash, property, promissory note or services, or any combination thereof.   
  (c) The Company shall be permitted to incur indebtedness for borrowed money, from the Member or otherwise. 
    3 

ARTICLE V 
  Distributions 
  5.1      Distributions  .  The Member shall determine profits available for distribution and the amount, if any, to be distributed to the Member, and shall authorize and distribute to the Member, the determined amount when, as and if declared by the Member.  The distributions of the Company shall be distributed entirely to the Member. 
  ARTICLE VI 
  Events of Dissolution 
  The Company shall be dissolved upon the first of the following events to occur: 
  (a)The consent of the Member at any time to dissolve and wind up the affairs of the Company; or 
  (b)The occurrence of any other event that causes the dissolution of a limited liability company under the Act. 
  In the event of any dissolution of the Company, the Member shall be in charge of such dissolution, and the Member shall immediately proceed with an orderly winding up of the Company s business and affairs and the orderly liquidation of the Company and its assets and make final distributions as provided in the Act; provided, that until all final distributions are made, the Member shall continue to operate the Company.  The duties of care and loyalty described in the Act still apply to the Member during the winding up and liquidation period.  The costs of liquidation shall be borne as a Company expense.  The Member shall not receive any additional compensation for services rendered during the winding up and liquidation of the Company. 
  Notwithstanding any provisions of the Act or other applicable law, an insolvency event, including a bankruptcy filing, by or against the Company or a Member shall not cause a dissolution of the Company nor shall such an insolvency event, including a bankruptcy filing, by or against a Member effect a deemed assignment, transfer, withdrawal or dissociation of such Member s interest in the Company or otherwise have any effect whatsoever on such Member s interest. 
  ARTICLE VII 
  Transfer of the Member s Common Units 
  The Member may sell, assign, transfer, convey, gift, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of any or all of its Common Units and, upon receipt by the Company of a written agreement executed by the person or entity to whom such Common Units are to be transferred agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as amended from time to time, such person shall be admitted as a member. 
    
  ARTICLE VIII 
  Exculpation and Indemnification 
    
  8.1      Exculpation  .  No officer of the Company or member of the Board of Directors or Managers (each a    Manager   ) or officer of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (each a    Subsidiary  ,  and collectively,    Subsidiaries   ) shall be liable to the Company or such Subsidiary, any other officer of the Company or any other officer or Manager of any Subsidiary or to any Member for any loss suffered by the Company or any Subsidiary unless such loss is caused by such officer of the Company's or such Manager or officer of such Subsidiary's gross negligence, willful misconduct, knowing violation of law or material breach of this Agreement, the Unitholders Agreement dated as of October 12, 2007 between CDW Holdings LLC and certain of its members, as the same may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its terms (the    Unitholders Agreement   ), or any other agreement between the Company or any Subsidiary and such officer of the Company or such Manager or officer of such Subsidiary.  No officer of the Company and no Manager or officer of any direct or  
    4 

indirect Subsidiary shall be liable to the Company or such Subsidiary, any other Manager or officer or any Member for errors in judgment or for any acts or omissions that do not constitute gross negligence, intentional misconduct, knowing violation of law or material breach of this Agreement or other agreement with the Company or its Subsidiaries.  Any officer of the Company and any Manager or officer of any of its Subsidiaries may consult with the Company's and such Subsidiary's counsel and accountants in respect of the Company's and such Subsidiary's affairs, and provided such officer of the Company or Manager or officer of such Subsidiary, as the case may be, acts in good faith reliance upon the advice or opinion of such counsel or accountants, such officer of the Company or such Manager or officer of such Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall not be liable for any loss suffered by the Company or such Subsidiary in reliance thereon. 
  8.2      Right to Indemnification  .  Subject to the limitations and conditions as provided in this   Article VIII  , each person or entity (   Person   ) who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative (hereinafter a "  Proceeding  "), or any appeal in such a Proceeding or any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she, or a Person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was an officer of the Company or, while an officer of the Company, is or was serving at the request of the Company as a manager, director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust or other enterprise, shall be indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment) against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) actually incurred by such Person in connection with such Proceeding; provided that (a) such Person's course of conduct was pursued in good faith and believed by him to be in the best interests of the Company and (b) such course of conduct did not constitute gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or knowing violation of law on the part of such Person and otherwise was materially in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Unitholders Agreement.  Indemnification under this   Article VIII     shall continue with respect to a Person who has ceased to serve in the capacity which initially entitled such Person to indemnity hereunder.  The rights granted pursuant to this   Article VIII   shall be deemed contractual rights, and no amendment, modification or repeal of this   Article VIII   shall have the effect of limiting or denying any such rights with respect to actions taken or Proceedings arising prior to any amendment, modification or repeal.  It is expressly acknowledged that the indemnification provided in this   Article VIII   could involve indemnification for negligence other than gross negligence. 
  8.3      Advance Payment  .  The right to indemnification conferred in this   Article VIII   shall, upon approval by the Member in each instance, include the right to be paid or reimbursed by the Company the reasonable expenses incurred by a Person of the type entitled to be indemnified under   Section 8.2   who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding and without any determination as to the Person's ultimate entitlement to indemnification; provided that the payment of such expenses incurred by any such Person in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of a written affirmation by such Person of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under   Article VIII   and a written undertaking, by or on behalf of such Person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this   Article VIII   or otherwise. 
  8.4      Indemnification of Employees and Agents  .  The Company may indemnify and advance expenses to any Person, as determined by the Member, by reason of the fact that such Person was an employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a manager, director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in such a capacity or arising out of his or her status as such a Person to the same extent that it shall indemnify and advance expenses to Managers and officers under this   Article VIII  . 
    5 

8.5      Appearance as a Witness  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this   Article VIII  , the Company may pay or reimburse reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by a Manager, officer or employee in connection with his or her appearance as a witness or other participation in a Proceeding related to or arising out of the business of the Company at a time when he or she is not a named defendant or respondent in the Proceeding. 
  8.6      Non exclusivity of Rights  .  The right to indemnification and the advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this   Article VIII   shall not be exclusive of any other right which a Manager, officer or other Person indemnified pursuant to this   Article VIII   may have or hereafter acquire under any law (common or statutory), any provision of the Articles of Organization     or this Agreement, the Unitholders Agreement, any other separate contractual arrangement, any vote of the Member or disinterested Managers, or otherwise. 
  8.7      Insurance  .  The Company may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Person who is or was serving as a officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a manager, director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the obligation to indemnify such Person against such expense, liability or loss under this   Article VIII  . 
  8.8      Savings Clause  .  If this   Article VIII   or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Company shall nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each Manager, officer or any other Person indemnified pursuant to this   Article VIII   as to costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this   Article VIII   that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 
    
  ARTICLE IX 
  Miscellaneous 
    
  9.1      Tax Treatment  .  The Company shall be taxed as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (as well as for any analogous state or local tax purposes), and the Member and the Company shall timely make any and all necessary elections and filings for the Company treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (as well as for any analogous state or local tax purposes). 
  9.2      Amendments  .  Amendments to this Agreement and to the Articles of Organization shall be approved in writing by the Member.  An amendment shall become effective as of the date specified in the approval of the Member or if none is specified as of the date of such approval or as otherwise provided in the Act. 
  9.3      Severability  .  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability;   provided, however,   that the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being impaired or invalidated in any way unless such invalid or unenforceable provision or clause shall be so significant as to materially affect the expectations of the Member regarding this Agreement.  Otherwise, any invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by the Member with a valid provision which most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid or unenforceable provision. 
  9.4      Governing Law  .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof. 
  9.5      Limited Liability Company  .  The Member intends to form a limited liability company and does not intend to form a partnership under the laws of the State of Wisconsin or any other laws. 
    6 

9.6      Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the instrument.

  CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO RULE 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a) UNDER  
  THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934  
    
  On August 1, 2015, CDW Corporation (the "registrant") completed the acquisition of Kelway TopCo Limited ("Kelway") by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased the registrant's ownership interest from 35% to 100% and provided the registrant control. Management has excluded this acquisition from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2015. Kelway represented   $897.5 million   of total assets as of December 31, 2015 and   $350.7 million   and   $8.6 million   of net sales and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. 
    
  I, Thomas E. Richards, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of the registrant; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
