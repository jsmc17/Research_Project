PART I 
      
  ITEM 1.   BUSINESS 
    
    GENERAL 
    
  Overview and Description of Material Subsidiaries 
    
  AEP was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized in 1925.  It is a public utility holding company that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other subsidiaries. 
    
  The service areas of AEP s public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  Transmission networks are interconnected with extensive distribution facilities in the territories served.  The public utility subsidiaries of AEP have traditionally provided electric service, consisting of generation, transmission and distribution, on an integrated basis to their retail customers. Restructuring laws in Michigan, Ohio and the ERCOT area of Texas have caused AEP public utility subsidiaries in those states to unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers.  In Ohio, AEP s regulated utility operates its distribution and transmission assets while its former generation assets are owned and operated by affiliates. 
    
  The member companies of the AEP System have contractual, financial and other business relationships with the other member companies, such as participation in the AEP System savings and retirement plans and tax returns, sales of electricity and transportation and handling of fuel.  The companies of the AEP System also obtain certain accounting, administrative, information systems, engineering, financial, legal, maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider, AEPSC. 
    
  As of December 31,   2015  , the subsidiaries of AEP had a total of 17,405 employees.  Because it is a holding company rather than an operating company, AEP has no employees.  The material subsidiaries of AEP are:

FINANCING 
    
  General 
    
  Companies within the AEP System generally use short-term debt to finance working capital needs.  Short-term debt may also be used to finance acquisitions, construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with long-term debt.  In recent history, short-term funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand, borrowing under AEP s revolving credit agreements and AEP s commercial paper program.  Funds are made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate borrowing program.  Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity.  See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the   2015   Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Financial Condition for additional information concerning short-term funding and access to bank lines of credit, commercial paper and capital markets. 
    
  AEP s revolving credit agreements (which backstop the commercial paper program) include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility, including a maximum debt/capital test.  In addition, the acceleration of AEP s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements.  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants.  With the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency, any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before  
    7 

termination of the agreements.  A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of AEP or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event.  See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the   2015   Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Financial Condition for additional information with respect to AEP s credit agreements. 
    
  AEP s subsidiaries have also utilized, and expect to continue to utilize, additional financing arrangements, such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements, including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities. 
    
    ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS 
    
  General 
    
  AEP subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with regard to air and water-quality control and other environmental matters, and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities.  The environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the AEP System are outlined below. 
    
  Clean Water Act Requirements 
    
  Operations for AEP subsidiaries are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits, and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants.  In 2014, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant s cooling water intake screen (impingement) or entrained in the cooling water.  The standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement.  Compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule.  The standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a site-specific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment.  Challenges to this final rule have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and additional changes could be made to this rule as a result of review by the court. 
    
  In November 2015, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to update the technology-based standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the Clean Water Act s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program.  For additional information, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues. 
    
  Coal Ash Regulation 
    
  AEP s operations produce a number of different coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash, gypsum and other materials.  Effective October 2015, the Federal EPA adopted a rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals, including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired electric generating units.  The final rule requires certain standards for location, groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities on a schedule spanning approximately four years after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register.  If existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards, they will be required to close, but the time frame for closure may be extended if adequate alternative disposal options are not available.  For additional information regarding the Federal EPA action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on operations, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Coal Combustion Residual Rule. 
    
  Clean Air Act Requirements 
    
  The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions.  The major CAA programs affecting AEP s power plants are described below.  The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements.   
    8 

AEP has made significant long-term investments in environmental controls to reduce air emissions from its power plants. Between 2000 and 2015, AEP invested approximately $8.1 billion in environmental controls, primarily related to CAA, that have significantly reduced emissions.  During the same time period and including our projections through 2017, AEP expects its emissions of mercury to have been reduced by approximately 85%.  Since 1990 and including our projections through 2017, AEP expects its emissions of SO   2    and NO   x    to have been reduced by approximately 90% and 85% respectively. 
    
  The Acid Rain Program 
    
  The 1990 Amendments to the CAA include a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO   2    emissions from power plants.  By 2000, the program established a nationwide cap on power plant SO   2    emissions of 8.9 million tons per year and required further reductions in 2010.  The 1990 Amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce NO   x    emissions through the use of available combustion controls. 
    
  The success of the SO   2    cap-and-trade program encouraged the Federal EPA and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs.  AEP continues to meet its obligations under the Acid Rain Program through the installation of controls, use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets.  Subsequent programs developed by the Federal EPA have imposed more stringent SO   2    and NO   x    emission reduction requirements than the Acid Rain Program on many AEP facilities.  Additional controls and other actions have been taken to achieve compliance with these programs at these facilities. 
    
  National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
    
  The CAA requires the Federal EPA to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin.  The Federal EPA also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them.  These concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). 
    
  Each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (nonattainment areas).  Each state must develop a state implementation plan (SIP) to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and maintain good air quality in attainment areas.  All SIPs are submitted to the Federal EPA for approval.  If a state fails to develop adequate plans, the Federal EPA develops and implements a plan.  As the Federal EPA reviews the NAAQS and establishes new concentration levels, the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new SIPs.  In 2008, the Federal EPA issued revised NAAQS for both ozone and fine particulate matter (PM   2.5   ).  The PM   2.5    standard was remanded by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and a new rule was signed by the administrator in December 2012 that lowered the annual standard.  A new ozone standard was adopted in 2015.  The Federal EPA also adopted a new short-term standard for SO   2    in 2010, a lower standard for NO   x    in 2010, and confirmed the existing standard for lead in 2014.  The existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011.  The states are in the process of developing new SIPs for the SO   2   , PM   2.5    and ozone standards, which could result in more stringent emission limitations being imposed on AEP facilities. 
    
  In 2005, the Federal EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which required additional reductions in SO   2    and NO   x    emissions from power plants and assists states developing new SIPs to meet the NAAQS.   In August 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to replace CAIR (the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)) that contains more stringent requirements to control SO   2    and NO   x    emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in 27 states and the District of Columbia.  Petitions for review were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and CSAPR was vacated.  That decision was subsequently reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court and remanded back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for further proceedings.  The Federal EPA filed a motion to lift the stay and allow Phase I of CSAPR to take effect on January 1, 2015 and Phase II to take effect on January 1, 2017.  The court granted the Federal EPA s motion, an interim final rule has been issued, and the court has remanded certain state budgets to Federal EPA for further rulemaking while the rule remains in effect.  Federal EPA has proposed more stringent NO   x    budgets for 23 states during the 2017 ozone season.  For additional information regarding CSAPR, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements. 
    9 

Hazardous Air Pollutants 
    
  As a result of the 1990 Amendments to the CAA, the Federal EPA investigated hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to Congress, identifying mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants as warranting further study.  In 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for new and existing coal and oil-fired utility units and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for emissions from new and modified power plants.  Petitions for review of the MACT standards were denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but in 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court determined that Federal EPA acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric generating units.  Federal EPA has issued a supplemental finding and the rule remains in effect.  For additional information regarding MACT, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements. 
    
  Regional Haze 
    
  The CAA establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas, including national parks, and requires states to submit SIPs that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas (Regional Haze program).  In 2005, the Federal EPA issued its Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), detailing how the CAA s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power plants. 
    
  PSO is in the process of implementing a settlement with the Federal EPA in order to comply with the Regional Haze program requirements in Oklahoma.  Federal EPA issued a proposed Federal Implementation Plan for Arkansas in 2015.  For additional information regarding CAVR and the Regional Haze program requirements, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements. 
    
  Climate Change  
    
  AEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO   2    emissions from its generating fleet and expects CO   2    emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coal-fired generation units, and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities.  AEP s total CO   2    emissions in 2015 (not including emissions from the Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek Plants) were approximately 102.4 million metric tons, a  30% reduction from AEP s 2005 CO   2    emissions of approximately 146 million metric tons.  Federal EPA has taken action to regulate CO   2    emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the CAA.  For example, the Federal EPA published the Clean Power Plan in October 2015.  Such actions, including the Clean Power Plan, are being legally challenged by numerous parties and final regulatory outcomes remain uncertain.  In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on the final Clean Power Plan, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans.  The stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court considers any petition for review.      For additional information regarding the Federal EPA action taken to regulate CO   2    emissions, including the Clean Power Plan, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Climate Change, CO   2    Regulation and Energy Policy. 
    
  Management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as AEP diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units.  The projected decline in coal-fired generation is due to a number of factors, including the ongoing cost of operating older units, the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources, increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals.  Management s strategy for this transformation includes diversifying AEP s fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas, increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources, where there is regulatory support. 
    
    10 

AEP s fossil fuel-fired generating units are large sources of CO   2    emissions.  If substantial additional CO   2    emission reductions are required, there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older, less-efficient, coal-fired units.  To the extent additional investments are made to reduce CO   2    emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase rates, return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings.  Prudently incurred capital investments made by AEP subsidiaries in rate-regulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment.  Management would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements.  However, requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can have adverse effects because regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that AEP would recover through higher rates. For sales of energy into competitive markets, however, there is no such recovery mechanism. 
    
  Renewable Sources of Energy 
    
  All of the states AEP serves (other than Kentucky and Tennessee) have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency, alternative energy, or renewable energy sources. 
    
  At the end of 2015, the AEP operating companies had long-term contracts for 2,031.5 MW of wind and 10.1 MW of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies  customers. In addition, I M began construction on the first of four solar projects that will make up I M s 14.7 MW Clean Energy Solar Pilot Project (CESPP) that was approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.  599 MWs of recently-completed wind projects under contract for PSO were in service as of late 2015, and the remaining three projects associated with I M s CESPP projects are expected to begin deliveries in 2016.  This will result in a total of 2,655.3 MW of wind and solar in-service for AEP.  Management actively manages AEP s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction. 
    
  The growth of AEP s renewable portfolio reflects the company s strategy to diversify its generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both energy and capacity needs.  In addition to gradually reducing AEP s reliance on coal-fueled generating units, the growth of renewables and natural gas helps AEP to maintain a diversity of generation resources.  
    
  The Clean Power Plan effectively establishes a renewable portfolio standard for each of AEP s states, creating additional opportunities for renewable growth. Independent of the Clean Power Plan, the integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by AEP s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect AEP s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers  desire for clean energy in a carbon-constrained world.  The Company has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources.  Transmission assets of the AEP System interconnect approximately 7,500 MW of renewable energy resources of third parties, and AEP s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources. 
    
  End Use Energy Efficiency  
    
  Beginning in 2008, AEP ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs.  These programs, commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management, were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available.  Since that time, AEP operating companies have implemented over 100 programs across the AEP service territory and in most of the states AEP serves.  For the period 2008 through 2015, these programs have reduced annual consumption by over 6.0 million megawatt hours and peak demand by over 1,500 MW.  AEP estimates that its operating companies spent approximately $875 million during that period  to achieve these levels.    
    
  Energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states AEP serves, and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for AEP operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings. Appropriate recovery of program costs, lost revenues, and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments.  The Clean Power Plan  could  
    11 

provide additional opportunities for energy efficiency if states develop implementation plans that require energy efficiency.  AEP believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a cost-effective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans. 
    
  AEP is also developing and marketing a merchant distributed resource portfolio.  AEP s newly-formed subsidiary, OnSite Partners LLC, works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions based upon market knowledge, technology innovations and deal structuring which may include distributed solar, wind, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other forms of cost reducing energy technologies.  OnSite Partners LLC pursues projects where a suitably termed power agreement is entered into with a credit-worthy counterparty. 
    
  Corporate Governance 
    
  In response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of AEP s strategic plan, the Board of Directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements such as the Clean Power Plan that could accelerate the retirement of coal-fired generation assets.  The Board of Directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would affect the company.  The Board s Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance oversees the company s annual Corporate Accountability Report, which includes information about the company s environmental, financial and social performance. 
    
  Other Environmental Issues and Matters 
    
  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites, as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites.  See Note   6   to the financial statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, included in the   2015   Annual Reports, under the heading entitled The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation for further information.

Environmental Investments 
    
  Investments related to improving AEP System plants  environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2013, 2014 and 2015 and the current estimate for 2016 are shown below.  AFUDC debt is included in the historical periods.  These investments include both environmental as well as other related spending.  Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends and the ability to access capital.  AEP expects to make substantial investments in future years in addition to the amounts set forth below in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generation plants for environmental quality controls.  Such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2015 or have been proposed and may be adopted.  Future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous.  These estimates do not include any projected costs that might be triggered by compliance with the Clean Power Plan.  The cost of complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the AEP System.  AEP typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions.  For AEP s merchant generation units however, there is no such recovery mechanism.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP s financial condition.  See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading entitled Environmental Issues and Note   6   to the financial statements, entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general. 

(a) 
    Includes expenditures of the subsidiaries shown and other subsidiaries not shown. The figures reflect construction expenditures, not investments in subsidiary companies.  Excludes discontinued operations. 
              (b) 
    For APCo, the projected environmental investments above include the conversions of 470 MWs of coal generation to natural gas.  If natural gas conversion is not completed, the units could be retired sooner than planned. 
        
  Management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with air and water quality standards and other impacts of the environmental proposals.  The following cost estimates for periods following 2016 will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in the final rules.  These cost estimates will also change based on: (a) the states  implementation of these regulatory programs, including the potential for state implementation plans (SIPs) or federal implementation plans (FIPs) that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired, replaced or sold, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and (g) other factors.  The following cost estimates do not include any projected costs that might be triggered by compliance with the Clean Power Plan and are limited to only the costs of major projects to comply with existing air and water quality standards.  In addition, management is continuing to evaluate the economic feasibility of environmental investments on both regulated and nonregulated plants. 
    13 

For the Registrant Subsidiaries, management s current ranges of estimates of environmental investments beginning in 2017, exclusive of debt AFUDC, are set forth below:  

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
    
  AEP s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below.   See Note   9   to the financial statements entitled Business Segments, included in the   2015   Annual Reports, for additional information on the operating segments.

    14 

VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES 
    
  GENERAL 
    
  AEP s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.  AEPSC, as agent for AEP s public utility subsidiaries, performs marketing, generation dispatch, fuel procurement and power-related risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries. 
    
  ELECTRIC GENERATION 
    
  Facilities 
    
  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 23,600 MW of domestic generation.  See Item 2   Properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries. 
    
  Fuel Supply 
    
  The 2013 results include fuel used and transported by OPCo, a utility subsidiary that is not part of the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment.  OPCo s results appear here because it retained its generation until year-end 2013 at which point all of its generation was transferred to AGR which transferred portions to APCo and KPCo. 
    
  The table shows the generation sources by type, on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Vertically Integrated Utilities: 

A price increase/decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreased/increased use of other fuels.  AEP s overall 2015 fossil fuel costs for the Vertically Integrated Utilities decreased approximately 12% on a dollar per MMBtu basis from 2014.  This was due to a significant decline in natural gas prices along with a marginal decrease in coal prices. 
    
  Coal and Lignite 
    
  AEP s Vertically Integrated Utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term contracts, affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms.  Coal consumption in 2015 decreased from 2014 due to a decrease in power prices and corresponding decrease in demand for coal-fired generation.  As a result, coal inventories ended the year at above-target levels on a system basis. 
    
  Management believes that the Vertically Integrated Utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignite-fired units.  Through subsidiaries, AEP owns, leases or controls more than 4,838 railcars, approximately 498 barges, 12 towboats, 8 harbor boats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in AEP generating facilities. 
    
  Spot market prices for coal continued to decrease throughout 2015.  The decreased spot coal prices reflect the reduction in demand for coal-fired generation and the oversupply in the market.   As of December 31, 2015, slightly less than half of the coal purchased by AEP was procured through term contracts.  As those contracts expire, they are replaced  
    15 

with contracts at current market prices.  The price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods.  The price paid for coal delivered in 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in spot coal prices and heavier reliance on shorter term contracts. 

The following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities: 

The coal supplies at  the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries.  As of December 31, 2015, the Vertically Integrated Utilities coal inventory was approximately 47 days of full load burn.  While inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary, the current coal inventory target for the Vertically Integrated Utilities is approximately 30 days. 
    
  Natural Gas 
    
  The Vertically Integrated Utilities consumed over 89 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2015 for generating power. This represents a decrease of 7% from 2014.  While AEP s natural gas-fired generating capacity has increased over the past several years with the addition of the Stall and Dresden units, the implementation of the SPP Market and change in the dispatch of AEP s natural gas fleet resulted in a decreased natural gas-fired generation.  Several of AEP s natural gas-fired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability. A portfolio of term, monthly, seasonal, and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant, as appropriate.  AEP s natural gas supply agreements are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices. 
    
  The following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities.  Results for 2013 include natural gas delivered to OPCo, while results for 2015 and 2014 do not. 

Nuclear 
    
  I M has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the Cook Plant.  I M has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot, short-term and mid-term markets.  I M also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel. 
    
  For purposes of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel, I M completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago.  I M entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue.  I M is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis.  I M completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in 2012, which consisted of 12 casks (32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each).  The second loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry casks was completed in 2015, which consisted of 16 casks.  The third dry cask loading is expected to occur in 2018. 
    
    16 

Nuclear Waste and Decommissioning 
    
  As the owner of the Cook Plant, I M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely.  The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program.  The most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2015.  The estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste for the Cook Plant was $1.6 billion in 2015 non-discounted dollars.  As of December 31,   2015  , the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the Cook Plant was approximately $1.8 billion. The balance of funds available to eventually decommission Cook Plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns.  The ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the: 

Escalation of various cost elements (including, but not limited to, general inflation and the cost of energy). 
                
    Further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning. 
                
    Technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies. 
                
    Availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities. 
                
    Availability of a United States Department of Energy facility for permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel. 
       
  Accordingly, management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the Cook Plant will not be significantly different than current projections.  AEP will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections.  See Note   6   to the financial statements, entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies under the heading Nuclear Contingencies, included in the   2015   Annual Reports, for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning. 
    
  Low-Level Radioactive Waste 
    
  The Low-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste rests with the individual states.  Low-level radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials.  Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available.  I M cannot predict when such a site may be available. However the states of Utah and Texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from Michigan waste generators.  There is currently no set date limiting I M s access to either of these facilities.  The Cook Plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste.  In the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable, then low level radioactive waste can be stored onsite at this facility. 
    
  Counterparty Risk Management 
    
  The Vertically Integrated Utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants.  As a result, counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions.  As of December 31,   2015  , counterparties posted approximately $9 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEPSC for the benefit of AEP s public utility subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately     $52 million with counterparties and exchanges).  Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily.  See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the   2015   Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information. 
    
    17 

Certain Power Agreements 
    
  I M  
    
  The Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I M, dated March 31, 1982, provides for the sale by AEGCo to I M of all the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant.  Whether or not power is available from AEGCo, I M is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by I M).  The agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of Unit 2 of the Rockport Plant have expired (currently December 2022) unless extended in specified circumstances. 
    
  Pursuant to an assignment between I M and KPCo, and a unit power agreement between AEGCo and KPCo, AEGCo sells KPCo 30% of the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant.  KPCo has agreed to pay to AEGCo the amounts that I M would have paid AEGCo under the terms of the Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I M for such entitlement.  The KPCo unit power agreement expires in December 2022. 
    
  OVEC 
    
  AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC.  The aggregate equity participation of AEP in OVEC is 43.47%.  Under the Inter-Company Power Agreement, which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each, the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MW) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I M and OPCo is 43.47%.  The Inter-Company Power Agreement terminates in June 2040.  The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital.  AEP and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests.  OVEC financed capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances, including tax-advantaged debt issuances.  Both OVEC generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls in service.  OPCo attempted to assign its rights and obligations under the Inter-Company Power Agreement to an affiliate as part of its transfer of its generation assets and liabilities in keeping with corporate separation required by Ohio law.  OPCo failed to obtain the consent to assignment from the other owners of OVEC and therefore filed a request with the PUCO seeking authorization to maintain its ownership of OVEC. In December 2013, the PUCO approved OPCo s request, subject to the condition that energy from the OVEC entitlements are sold into the day-ahead or real-time PJM energy markets, or on a forward basis through a bilateral arrangemen  t.  OPCo has filed an application with the PUCO to approve a cost-based purchased power agreement (PPA) rider that would initially be based upon OPCo s contractual entitlement under the Inter-Company Agreement which is approximately 20% of OVEC s capacity  . 
    
  ELECTRIC DELIVERY 
    
  General 
    
  Other than AEGCo, AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power.  See Item 2   Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines.  Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC.  See Item 1. Business   Vertically Integrated Utilities   Regulation   Rates.  The FERC regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts.  The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, principles, protocols and agreements in place with PJM, SPP and ERCOT, and as approved by the FERC.  See Item 1. Business   Vertically Integrated Utilities   Regulation   FERC.  As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to non-affiliated companies. 
    18 

Other than AEGCo, AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.  In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory.  These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.  In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.  For a discussion of competition in the sale of power, see Item 1. Business   Vertically Integrated Utilities   Competition. 
    
  Transmission Agreement  
    
  APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT and are parties to the TA.  OPCo, a subsidiary in AEP s Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment, is also a party to the TA.  The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM.  The TA has been approved by the FERC. 
    
  TCA, OATT, and ERCOT Protocols  
    
  PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA.  Under the TCA, a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of (a) overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement, including the performance of transmission planning studies, (b) the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and (c) compliance with the terms of the OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such tariff.  Pursuant to the TCA, AEPSC has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on behalf of the other parties to the agreement.  The TCA also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the OATT.  These allocations have been determined by the FERC-approved OATT for the SPP. 
    
  Regional Transmission Organizations 
    
  AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM, and PSO and SWEPCo are members of the SPP (both FERC-approved RTOs).  RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not. 
    
  REGULATION 
    
  General 
    
  AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries  retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional cost-based regulation by the state utility commissions.  AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions.  I M is subject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to the operation of the Cook Plant.  AEP and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of EPACT, much of which is administered by the FERC. 
    
  Rates 
    
  Historically, state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service.  A utility s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.  State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (a) a utility s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility s level of investment.  Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period  
    19 

of time, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative.  Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers.  Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time. 
    
  Public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service.  Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment, it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery.  Given long lead times in construction, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets, management is actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow.  AEP representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process.  These options include pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates. 
    
  The rates of AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service).  Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility s rates and tariffs.  Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes. 
    
  The following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate.  Several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction.  See Note   4   to the financial statements, entitled Rate Matters, included in the   2015   Annual Reports, for more information regarding pending rate matters.

  I M provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the IURC, with rates set on a cost-of-service basis.  Indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism. 
    
  Oklahoma 
    
  PSO provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the OCC.  PSO s rates are set on a cost-of-service basis.  Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatt-hour sales.  The factors are generally adjusted annually and are based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs.  Over or under collections of fuel and purchased energy costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the period following when new annual factors are established. 
    
  Virginia 
    
  APCo currently provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled rates approved by the Virginia SCC.  Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause.  Transmission services are provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC.  In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses. 
    
  West Virginia 
    
  APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-service basis.  West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which trues-up to actual expenses. 
    
    20 

FERC 
    
  Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale, transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects.  The FERC regulations require AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates.  The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers.  The FERC also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by (a) approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and (b) granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at market-based rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices.  AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have market-based rate authority from the FERC, under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place.  The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, to file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility s own uses of its transmission system.  The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities  transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility s marketing employees. 
    
  The FERC oversees RTOs, entities created to operate, plan and control utility transmission assets.  Order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable RTO proposals.  AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM.  PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP. 
    
  The FERC has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of AEP s public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition of securities of utilities, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company.  In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.  EPACT gives the FERC increased utility merger oversight. 
    
  COMPETITION 
    
  The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP, like the electric industry generally, face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis, primarily to other public utilities and power marketers.  Federal policy generally fosters competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market and mandates that all generators have equal access to transmission services.  As a result, there are more generators able to participate in this market.  The principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price (including fuel costs), reliability of service, and availability of capacity and power. 
    
  Technology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries.  AEP s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries also compete with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.  The primary factors in such competition are price, reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power.  With respect to competing generators and self-generation, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they currently maintain a competitive position.  
    
  Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP s competitiveness.   
    
    21 

While the adoption rate of distributed generation in AEP s service areas has not reached the levels seen in other parts of the country, AEP s vertically integrated utility companies are focused on providing customers with more choices by working with regulators and policymakers to expand, and potentially accelerate, renewable energy offerings.  Such additional customer choices consider not only long-term cost, but are also focused on expanding resource diversity.  This includes proposed new revenue structures that enable deployment of advanced technologies and resources. In 2015, AEP formed an Enterprise Technology Council to develop and deploy new programs and services designed to receive regulatory support.  The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that the reliability of their service, the limited ability of customers to substitute other economical sources for electric power and their ability to cost-effectively deploy advanced technologies, such as solar, on a large scale place them in a favorable competitive position.  
    
  In the event that alternative generation resources are mandated  ,   subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation     or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.  This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output. These events could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  If AEP retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  AEP typically recovers undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. 
    
  Recent changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the United States, including those served by the AEP System.  Industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs, which may include, among other things, the cost of electric power.  The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP work with such customers to meet their business needs through, for example, providing various off-peak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with, and approved by, the various state commissions.  The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP also work with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources.  Depending on the jurisdiction, customers may have access to green power tariffs.  In other instances, AEP purchases renewable power that is available to all customers in a specific jurisdiction. 
    
  SEASONALITY 
    
  The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEP s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP s results of operations and may impact its financial condition.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP s results of operations. 
    
    22 

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES 
    
  GENERAL 
    
  This segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by OPCo, TCC and TNC. OPCo is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately   1,468,000   retail customers in Ohio.  TCC is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately   826,000   retail customers through REPs in southern Texas. TNC is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately   189,000   retail customers through REPs in west and central Texas. 
    
  AEP s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power.  See Item 2   Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines.  Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are made at rates approved by the PUCT for TCC and TNC and by the PUCO and the FERC for OPCo.  The FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions.  As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to non-affiliated companies. 
    
  AEP s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.  In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service.  These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.  In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business. 
    
  The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and ERCOT, and as approved by the FERC.  In addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas, AEP s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries through RTOs also provide transmission services for non-affiliated companies. 
    
  Transmission Agreement  
    
  OPCo, together with APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo, is a party to the TA.  The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the cost of their transmission facilities.  The TA has been approved by the FERC. 
    
  Regional Transmission Organizations  
    
  OPCo is a member of PJM, a FERC-approved RTO.  RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not.  TCC and TNC are members of ERCOT. 
    
  REGULATION 
    
  OPCo provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at cost-based rates approved by the PUCO or by the FERC.  TCC and TNC provide transmission and distribution service on a cost-of-service basis at rates approved by the PUCT and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the FERC consistent with PUCT rules.  Transmission and distribution rates are established on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service.  The cost of service generally reflects operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.  Utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (a) a utility s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility s level of investment. 
    
    23 

FERC 
    
  Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC regulates rates for transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters.  The FERC regulations require AEP to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates.  The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers.  The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility s own uses of its transmission system.  The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities  transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility s marketing employees. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.  EPACT gives the FERC increased utility merger oversight.

AEP Oklahoma Transmission Company, Inc. (OKTCo) 
                
    AEP Southwestern Transmission Company, Inc. (SWTCo) (covering Louisiana) 
       
  Transmission development through the Transcos is primarily driven by: 

Improvements to local area reliability by upgrading, rebuilding or replacing existing, aging infrastructure. 
                
    Construction of new facilities to support customer points of delivery, generation interconnections, new facilities to provide transmission service directed by the RTOs, and new facilities required to maintain grid reliability. 
       24 

Projects assigned as a result of the regional planning initiatives conducted by PJM and SPP.  PJM and SPP identify the need for transmission in support of regional reliability, congestion reduction and the integration of and retirement of generation facilities. 
       
  The Transcos develop, own and operate transmission assets that are physically connected to AEP s existing system.  They are regulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by the FERC and employ a forward-looking formula rate tariff design.  The Transcos are independent of, but overlay AEP s existing vertically integrated utility operating companies and the transmission operations of OPCo.  IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, OKTCo and WVTCo have received approvals for formation or did not require state commission approval to operate.  IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, OKTCo and WVTCo currently own and operate transmission assets.  An application for regulatory approval for SWTCo is under consideration in Louisiana.  As of December 31, 2015, AEPTCo s subsidiaries had $2.8 billion of transmission assets in-service with plans to construct approximately $3.5 billion of additional transmission assets through 2018. 
    
    25 

AEPTHCo JOINT VENTURE INITIATIVES 
    
  AEP has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing, building, and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in North America.  
    
  AEP is currently participating in the following joint venture initiatives: 

(a) 
    ETT is undertaking multiple projects and the completion dates will vary for those projects.  ETT s investment in completed, current and future projects in ERCOT over the next ten years is expected to be $3.5 billion.  Future projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
              (b) 
    AEP owns 25% of Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC (Prairie Wind) through its ownership interest in ETA.  ETA is a 50/50 joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly known as MidAmerican Energy) and AEP. 
              (c) 
    The Pioneer project consists of approximately 286 miles of new 765 kV transmission lines, which is estimated to cost $1.1 billion at completion.  Pioneer is developing the first 66-mile segment jointly with Northern Indiana Public Service Company at a total estimated cost of $386 million.  The projected completion date for the first 66-mile segment is 2018.  The projected completion dates for the remaining segments have not been determined. 
              (d) 
    AEP owns 87.5% of RITELine Indiana, LLC (RITELine IN) through its ownership interest in RITELine Transmission Development, LLC (RTD) and AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC (AEPTHCo).  AEP owns 12.5% of RITELine Illinois, LLC (RITELine IL) through its ownership interest in RTD.  RTD is a 50/50 joint venture with Exelon Transmission Company, LLC and AEPTHCo. 
              (e) 
    RITELine IN is a consolidated variable interest entity.  RTD received an order from the FERC in October 2011 granting incentives for the RITELine IN and RITELine IL projects.  The projects and other segments that are electrically equivalent in nature will continue to be submitted for consideration in the interregional planning process between PJM and MISO as dictated by emerging system needs. 
              (f) 
    AEP owns 86.5% of Transource Missouri and Transource West Virginia through its ownership interest in Transource Energy, LLC (Transource).  Transource is a joint venture with AEPTHCo and Great Plains Energy formed to pursue competitive transmission projects.  AEPTHCo and Great Plains Energy own 86.5% and 13.5% of Transource, respectively. 
              (g) 
    The ROE represents the weighted average approved return on equity based on the projected costs of two projects currently under development by Transource Missouri:  the $65 million Iatan-Nashua project (10.3%) and the $266 million Sibley-Nebraska City project (11.3%). 
              (h) 
    An application for recovery has been filed and a settlement is pending which calls for 10% Base ROE, together with a 0.50% rider, for Transource West Virginia s 15 mile 138kV line Thorofare project. 
              (i) 
    RITELine IN, Transource Missouri and Transource West Virginia are consolidated joint ventures by AEP.  Therefore, the investment value listed reflects applicable income taxes that are the responsibility of AEP.  All other investments in this schedule are joint ventures that are not consolidated by AEP.  Therefore, these investment values listed do not reflect income taxes that are the responsibility of AEP. 
       
  AEP s joint ventures do not have employees.  Business services for the joint ventures are provided by AEPSC and other AEP subsidiaries and the joint venture partners.  During 2015 approximately 521 AEPSC employees and 253 operating company employees provided service to one or more joint ventures. 
    26 

REGULATION 
    
  The Transcos and joint ventures located outside of ERCOT establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the FERC pursuant to FERC-approved implementation protocols.  The protocols include a transparent, formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated. 
    
  The Transcos  and joint ventures  (where applicable) rates are included in the respective OATT for PJM and SPP.  An OATT is the FERC rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider s transmission system.  The FERC requires transmission providers such as PJM and SPP to offer transmission service to all eligible customers (for example, load-serving entities, power marketers, generators and customers) on a non-discriminatory basis. 
    
  The FERC-approved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with FERC.  The formula rates establish rates for a one-year period based on the current projects in-service and proposed projects for a defined timeframe.  The formula rates also include a true-up calculation for the previous year s billings, allowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owner s ATRR.  PJM and SPP pay the transmission owners their ATRR for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the PJM and SPP OATTs, based on the terms and conditions in the respective OATT for the service taken. 
    
  The formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of 11.49% based on a capital structure of up to 50% equity for the AEP East Transmission Companies.  The AEP West Transmission Companies are allowed a return on equity of 11.2% based on a capital structure of up to 50% equity. The authorized returns on equity for the Transcos are commensurate with the FERC-authorized returns on equity in the PJM and SPP OATTs, respectively, for AEP s utility subsidiaries. 
    
  In the annual rate base filings described above, the Transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of $2.3 billion in 2015, $1.4 billion for 2014 and $776 million for 2013.  The total transmission revenue requirement filed in the ATRR, including prior year over/under-recovery of revenue and associated carrying charges, for 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $363 million, $231 million, $107 million and $34 million, respectively. 
    
  The rates of ETT, which is located in ERCOT, are determined by the PUCT.  ETT sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim Transmission Costs of Services (TCOS) filings.  ETT may file interim TCOS filings semi-annually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital.    In November 2015, the PUCT ordered ETT to file a base rate case by February 2017.  A base rate review could produce a refund if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim TCOS increase was based.  A refund of interim transmission rates would reduce future net income and cash flows.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring.    See Note   4   to the financial statements, entitled Rate Matters, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, for more information regarding pending rate matters. 
    
  AEP s joint ventures have approved returns on equity ranging from 9.96% to 12.8% based on equity capital structures ranging from 40% to 60%. 
    
  COMPETITION 
    
  One of the most significant provisions of FERC Order No. 1000 is the removal of the federal right of first refusal for incumbent utilities within tariffs and agreements for certain regional transmission projects. Historically, vertically integrated public utilities had the right to build and own transmission lines proposed by the region s planning processes when those lines connected to facilities within their respective retail service territories.  FERC Order No. 1000 eliminates the federal right of first refusal in RTO tariffs for incumbent utilities to construct certain regional transmission projects within their own service territories, thereby creating the opportunity for any qualified entity to build and own regional transmission facilities in any service territory.  Transource was created to respond to FERC Order No. 1000 competitive processes at the RTO level. 
    
    27 

GENERATION   MARKETING 
    
  GENERAL 
    
  The AEP Generation   Marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive nonutility generating assets, a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business.  The largest subsidiary in the Generation   Marketing segment is AGR.  AGR owns 6,752 MW of generating capacity, with rights to an additional 1,186 MW pursuant to a unit power agreement (see below).  Other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets.  See Item 2   Properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the Generation   Marketing segment. AGR is a competitive generation subsidiary. 
    
  With respect to wholesale energy trading and marketing business, AEP Generation   Marketing segment subsidiaries enter into short and long-term transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in ERCOT, SPP, MISO and PJM.  These subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities.   
    
  These activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity (and to a lesser extent, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances) under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices.  These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, over-the-counter swaps and options.  The majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts.  These transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges. 
    
  With respect to the retail supply and energy management business, AEP s subsidiary AEP Energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial customers.  AEP Energy provides an array of energy solutions and is operating in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington, D.C.  AEP Energy also provides demand-side management solutions nationwide.  AEP Energy had approximately 375,000 customer accounts as of December 31,   2015  . 
    
  REGULATION 
    
  AGR is a public utility under the Federal Power Act, and is subject to FERC s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable.  FERC granted AGR market-based rate authority in December 2013.  FERC s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of utilities (including AGR, which is a public utility as defined by the FERC) and set cost-based rates if FERC subsequently determines that such utility can exercise market power, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.  As a condition to the order granting AGR market-based rate authority, every three years AGR is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet FERC s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for market-based rates.  Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, review of mergers, and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility. 
    
  Specific operations of AGR are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies, including Federal and state environmental protection agencies.  AGR is also regulated by the PUCT for transactions inside ERCOT.  Additionally, AGR is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, with the approval of FERC.  
    
  COMPETITION 
    
  The AEP Generation   Marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power, capacity and ancillary services.  The principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation. Because much of AGR s  
    28 

generation is coal-fired, lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation.  Other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation, transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities, inoperability or inefficiencies, outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities. 
    
  Technology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEP s Generation   Marketing segment.  AGR also competes with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.  The primary factors in such competition are price, unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power.  
    
  Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AGR s competitiveness.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive. 
    
  While the adoption rate of distributed generation in areas that AGR sells power has not reached the levels seen in other parts of the country, AEP expects these trends to continue.  AGR believes that the unit availability, the limited ability of customers to substitute other economical sources for electric power and its ability to cost-effectively deploy advanced technologies, such as solar, on a large scale place it in a favorable competitive position. 
    
  In the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output. These events could cause AGR to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.   If AGR retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AGR will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants and may be forced to shut down competitive units.   
    
  Recent changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the United States, including those served by the Generation   Marketing segment.  Industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs, which may include, among other things, the cost of electric power.  The Generation   Marketing segment works with such customers to meet their business needs through, for example, providing various off-peak or interruptible supply options.  The Generation   Marketing segment also works with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources. 
    
  SEASONALITY 
    
  The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change.

  The table shows the generation sources by type, on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Generation and Marketing segment, not including the Oklaunion generating unit: 

29 

A price increase/decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreased/increased use of other fuels. 
    
  Coal and Consumables 
  AGR procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms.  As contracts expire, they are replaced, as needed, with contracts at market prices. Coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements. 
  Management believes that AGR will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal fired units.  AGR, through its contracts with third party transporters, has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facilities.  AGR plants consumed 11.2 million tons of coal in 2015. 
    
  The coal supplies at AGR plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, coal quality, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries.  AGR likes to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plants in the range of 15 to 40 days of full load burn.  As of December 31, 2015, the coal inventory of AGR was approximately 57 days of full load burn. 
    
  Natural Gas 
    
  Despite the availability of natural gas due to the increased shale supply, the U.S. pipeline infrastructure remains a limiting factor in the expansion of natural gas-fired generation.  A portfolio of term, monthly, seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements (that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices) supplies natural gas requirements for each plant, as appropriate.  AGR plants consumed 86 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2015, an increase of approximately 73% from 2014. 
    
  Counterparty Risk Management 
    
  Counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions.  As of December 31,   2015  , counterparties posted approximately $26 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEP for the benefit of AEP s Generation   Marketing segment subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP s Generation   Marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately     $225 million with counterparties and exchanges).  Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily.  See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the   2015   Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information. 
    
  Certain Power Agreements 
    
  AEGCo 
    
  The Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and AGR (assigned from OPCo) dated March 15, 2007, provides for the sale by AEGCo to AGR of all the capacity and associated unit contingent energy and ancillary services available to AGR from the Lawrenceburg Plant, a 1,186 MW natural gas-fired unit owned by AEGCo.  AGR is obligated to pay a capacity charge (whether or not power is available from the Lawrenceburg Plant), and the fuel, operating and maintenance charges associated with the energy dispatched by AGR, and to reimburse AEGCo for other costs associated with the operation and ownership of the Lawrenceburg Plant.  The agreement will continue in effect until December 31, 2017 unless extended. 
    
    30 

OPCo 
    
  Pursuant to a Power Supply Agreement (PSA) between AGR and OPCo, AGR supplied capacity for OPCo s switched and non-switched retail load for the period January 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015. 
    
  Other 
    
  As of December 31,   2015  , the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 310 MW of company-owned domestic wind power facilities, 177 MW of domestic wind power from long-term purchase power agreements and 355 MW of coal-fired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers TNC s interest in the Oklaunion power station to AEP Energy Partners, Inc.  The power obtained from the Oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ERCOT. 
    
    AEP RIVER OPERATIONS 
    
  Prior to its sale in November 2015, AEP River Operations segment transported liquid, coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the Ohio, Illinois and lower Mississippi rivers.  As a result of the sale, AEP River Operations is no longer a business segment.

ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS 
    
  In addition to other disclosures within this report, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be considered in evaluating the Registrants.  Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought.  As indicated below, many of the following risk factors apply to AEP and several or all of the Registrant Subsidiaries and, accordingly, such risk factors should be read to include the applicable Registrants.  
    
  GENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONS 
    
  AEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  AEP s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their planned extensive investment.  This would cause financial results to be diminished. 
    
  Regulated electric revenues, earnings and results are dependent on state regulation that may limit AEP s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Ohio, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, Michigan and Tennessee. If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted. Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost, including fuel and related costs, generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved. 
    
  AEP s transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Management expects that a growing portion of AEP s earnings in the future will be derived from the transmission investments and activities of AEPTCo and transmission joint ventures.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.  If the FERC were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for AEP s transmission investments and facilities, or if one or more states were to successfully limit FERC jurisdiction on recovery of costs on transmission investment and its return, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
    33 

AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP and its subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled. 
    
  AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  Through I M, AEP owns the Cook Plant.  It consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,191 MW, or about 7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  AEP and I M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following: 

The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel. 
                
    Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations. 
                
    Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the losses of others). 
                
    Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. 
       
  There can be no assurance that I M s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered. 
    
  The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I M to make material contributory payments. 
    
  Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured. 
    
    34 

The different regional power markets in which AEP subsidiaries compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures, which could affect performance in these regions. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various regional power markets, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.  Because the manner in which RTOs will evolve remains unclear, management is unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on the business. 
    
  AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates. 
    
  RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKS 
    
  AEP s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including: 

Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. 
                
    Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements. 
                
    Labor disputes. 
                
    Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards. 
                
    Information technology failure that impairs AEP s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations. 
                
    Information technology failure that affects AEP s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims. 
                
    Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors. 
                
    Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences. 
                
    Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry. 
       
  Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential     information and damage AEP s reputation.     (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP owns assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run AEP facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view AEP s computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber attack.  In addition, the business requires that AEP collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. 
    35 

A successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP s reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
  In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, AEP has a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems. In addition, AEP is subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements. However, cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt, and, as a result, there is a risk that AEP could experience a successful cyber attack despite current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts. 
    
  If AEP is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP s ability to raise capital and fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  In addition, certain sources of debt and equity capital gave expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  If sources of capital for AEP disappear, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
  Downgrades in AEP s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital and/or to operate the power trading businesses. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.  AEP s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  In periods of market turmoil, access to capital is difficult for all borrowers.  If AEP s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
  AEP s power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of AEP s individual public utility subsidiaries  senior unsecured long-term debt or on the investment grade ratings of AEP.  Most counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions.  If those ratings were to decline below investment grade, AEP s ability to operate the power trading business profitably would be diminished because AEP would likely have to deposit cash or cash-related instruments which would reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
  AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP) 
    
  AEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.  Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.  Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness. 
    
    36 

AEP s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that AEP enters into.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable. 
    
  Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
  Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced. 
    
  Changes in the price of commodities, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP s cost of producing power or decrease the amount received from selling power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of coal used as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  As long as current environmental programs remain in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  If the Federal EPA is able to create a replacement rule to reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP needs to obtain allowances under a replacement rule, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  AEP s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge. 
    
  AEP also owns natural gas-fired facilities which exposes AEP to market prices of natural gas.  Historically, natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources. Recently however, the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility.  AEP s ability to make sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas.  As the price of natural gas falls, other market participants that utilize natural gas-fired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to AEP s sales prices, so the margins realized from sales will be lower and, on occasion, AEP may need to curtail operation of marginal plants.  Management expects the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a long-term material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas. 
    
    37 

Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of coal, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
  In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked to market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events.  Customers  energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers  energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes. 
    
  Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers. 
    
  Severe weather impacts AEP s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase AEP s cost of providing service.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks. 
    
  To the extent climate change impacts a region s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System. 
    
  Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note   6   of the Notes to Financial Statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
    38 

RISKS RELATING TO STATE RESTRUCTURING 
    
  Collection of revenues in Texas is concentrated in a limited number of REPs. (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ERCOT area of Texas are collected from REPs that supply the electricity AEP distributes to REP customers.  Currently, AEP does business with approximately one hundred REPs.  In 2015, TCC s largest REP accounted for 23% of its operating revenue and its second largest REP accounted for 22% of its operating revenue; TNC s largest REP accounted for 11% of its operating revenues, and its second largest REP accounted for 10% of its operating revenues.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the Texas market or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for services or cause them to delay such payments.  AEP depends on these REPs for timely remittance of payments.  Any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. 
    
  RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWER 
    
  Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  Approximately 90% of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  These expenditures have been significant in the past, and management expects that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations.  Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated.  If AEP retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.   For AEP s merchant generation units, there is no such cost-recovery mechanism.   As a result, AEP may not recover costs through the market and may be forced to shut competitive units down.  The costs of compliance for AEP s competitive units could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. 
    
  Regulation of CO   2    emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  In 2015, the Federal EPA issued final CO   2    emissions standards for new power generation sources, and final emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel fired electric generating units.  The standards for new coal-fired generating units are based on the use of partial carbon capture and storage.  The standards for natural gas combined cycle units are based on the use of efficient combined cycle generating technology. The Clean Power Plan guidelines for existing sources include aggressive emission rate goals that are composed of a number of measures and seek nationwide reductions of CO   2    emissions of approximately 32% from 2005 levels by 2030.  The Clean Power Plan is intended to be implemented pursuant to individual state plans beginning in 2022.  In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on the final Clean Power Plan, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans.  The stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court considers any petition for review.      All of the final requirements are currently the subject of litigation in the federal courts.

CO   2    standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  If AEP retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.   For AEP s merchant generation units, there is no such cost-recovery mechanism.   As a result, AEP may not recover costs through the market and may be forced to shut competitive units down.  The costs of compliance for AEP s competitive units could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. 
    
  AEP s financial performance  may be adversely affected if the merchant generation fleet is not profitable or loses value. (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Management is evaluating strategic alternatives for AEP s merchant generation fleet, which primarily includes AGR s generation fleet which operates in PJM.  Management has not made a decision regarding the potential alternatives, nor have they set a specific timeframe for a decision.  Certain of these alternatives could result in a loss which could reduce future net income and cash flow and harm financial condition. 
    
  Amounts AEP receives from the results of PJM capacity auctions associated with nonregulated generation assets could fail to adequately compensate AEP. (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Financial returns on AGR s generation capacity are subject to the results of annual PJM capacity auctions.  Auction results indicate a great deal of volatility and the possibility of clearing prices substantially lower than the cost of such capacity.  If the PJM capacity auctions result in clearing prices lower than the cost of AEP s capacity, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition. 
    
  Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants  power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications of AEP s existing coal-fired power plants could be required and AEP might be required to limit or reduce emissions.  Such remedies could require AEP to purchase power from third parties to fulfill AEP s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on costs.  In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  While management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in AEP jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis, without such recovery, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation. 
    
  Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of generating facilities. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities.  This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than (a) newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and (b) distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.  Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP s competitiveness.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.  It is possible that advances in technologies, the availability of distributed generation or changes in  
    40 

regulatory policies will lower the demand for electricity or reduce the costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production, either of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. 
    
  Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output. These events could adversely affect AEP s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could also result in an impairment of certain long-lived assets. 
    
  Profitability is impacted by AEP s continued authorization to sell power at market-based rates. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  FERC has granted AGR, APCo, I M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. FERC reserves the right to revoke or revise this market-based rate authority if it subsequently determines that one or more of these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.  Each company that has obtained market-based rate authority from FERC must file a market power update every three years to show that they continue to meet FERC s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for market-based rates.  The loss of market-based rate authority by any of these entities, especially by AGR, could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. 
    
  Revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond AEP s control. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.  With respect to such transactions, the rate of return on capital investments is not determined through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power in regional markets and competitive markets.  These market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time.  Sales margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline.  In addition, the FERC, which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates, as well as RTOs that oversee some of these markets, may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.  Power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the FERC.  Fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile, and the price AEP can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel and/or emissions costs.  These factors could reduce margins and therefore diminish revenues and results of operations.  Volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from: 

Weather conditions, including storms. 
                
    Economic conditions. 
                
    Outages of major generation or transmission facilities. 
                
    Seasonality. 
                
    Power usage. 
                
    Illiquid markets. 
                
    Transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies. 
                
    Availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources. 
                
    Demand for energy commodities. 
                
    Natural gas, crude oil and refined products and coal production levels. 
                
    Natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events. 
                
    Federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation and/or incentives. 
                
    RTO market structures.

Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  The exposure of AEP s power trading activities is managed by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures.  These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities.  As a result, management cannot predict the impact that AEP s energy trading and risk management decisions may have on AEP s business, operating results or financial position. 
    
  AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position. 
    
  AEP s power trading risk management activities, including power sales agreements with counterparties, rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities.  These factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made.  Even when policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates, results of operations may be impacted if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate. 
    
  AEP s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, through long-term power purchase agreements, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices. 
    
  In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations. 
    
  Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or power could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict. 
    
  AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP s power. (Applies to all Registrants) 
    
  AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure. 
    
  The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.

Transmission and Distribution Utilities Segment 

AEP Transmission Holdco Segment 
    
  The following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission lines of certain wholly-owned and joint venture-owned entities: 

TITLE TO PROPERTY 
    
  The AEP System s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple.  The greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the AEP System has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority.  The rights of AEP s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business.  Minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist, but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties.  AEP s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them, if necessary, to acquire, perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations.  Legislation in Ohio and Virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes. 
    
    SYSTEM TRANSMISSION LINES AND FACILITY SITING 
    
  Laws in the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities and/or routes of high-voltage transmission lines.  AEP has experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which AEP s operating companies have sought to acquire rights-of-way through condemnation.  These proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years. 
    
    CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM 
    
  With input from its state utility commissions, the AEP System continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation, transmission, distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers.  In this assessment process, assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified, as appropriate.  AEP forecasts approximately $5 billion of construction expenditures for   2016  .  Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business  
    47 

opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, weather and the ability to access capital.  For additional information on AEP s construction program, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Budgeted Construction Expenditures. 
    
    POTENTIAL UNINSURED LOSSES 
    
  Some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities, including liabilities relating to damage to AEP s generation plants and costs of replacement power.  Unless allowed to be recovered through rates, future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could reduce net income and impact the financial conditions of AEP and other AEP System companies.  For risks related to owning a nuclear generating unit, see Note   6   to the financial statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies under the heading Nuclear Contingencies for information with respect to nuclear incident liability insurance.

  For a discussion of material legal proceedings, see Note   6   to the financial statements, entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, incorporated by reference in Item 8. 
    
    ITEM 4.   MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE 
    
  The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) imposes stringent health and safety standards on various mining operations.  The Mine Act and its related regulations affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, equipment used in mine emergency procedures, mine plans and other matters.  SWEPCo, through its ownership of Dolet Hills Lignite Company, LLC (DHLC), and AGR and KPCo, through their interest in the Conner Run fly ash impoundment, are subject to the provisions of the Mine Act. 
    
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder require companies that operate mines to include in their periodic reports filed with the SEC, certain mine safety information covered by the Mine Act.  Exhibit 95  Mine Safety Disclosure Exhibit  contains the notices of violation and proposed assessments received by DHLC and Conner Run under the Mine Act for the quarter ended December 31,   2015  .

    ITEM 9A.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  During   2015  , management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each of American Electric Power Company, Inc. ( AEP ), Appalachian Power Company, Indiana Michigan Power Company, Ohio Power Company, Public Service Company of Oklahoma and Southwestern Electric Power Company (each a  Registrant  and collectively the  Registrants ) evaluated each respective Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures.  Disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures of the Registrant that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to each Registrant s management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  As of December 31,   2015  , these officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures in place are effective and provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures accomplished their objectives.  The Registrants continually strive to improve their disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of their financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as events warrant. 
    
  There have been no changes in the Registrants  internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter 2015 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants  internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Management assessed and reported on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2015  .  As a result of that assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of December 31,   2015   and, therefore, concluded that each Registrant s internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
    
  Additional information required by this item of the Registrants is incorporated by reference to Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, included in the   2015   Annual Report of each Registrant.

1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The condensed financial information of Parent is required as a result of the restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries exceeding 25% of consolidated net assets as of December 31,   2015  .  Parent is a public utility holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other subsidiaries, including joint ventures and equity investments.  The primary source of income for Parent is equity in its subsidiaries  earnings.  Its major source of cash is dividends from the subsidiaries.  Parent borrows the funds for the money pool that is used by the subsidiaries for their short-term cash needs. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Parent files a consolidated federal income tax return with its subsidiaries.  AEP System s current consolidated federal income tax is allocated to AEP System companies so that their current tax expense reflects a separate return result for each company in the consolidated group.  The tax benefit of Parent is allocated to its subsidiaries with taxable income. 
    
    2.    COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Parent and its subsidiaries are parties to environmental and other legal matters.  For further discussion of commitments, guarantees and contingencies, see Note   6   in the   2015   Annual Reports. 
    
    3.    FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
    
  The following details long-term debt outstanding as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  : 
    
  Long-term Debt 

Long-term debt outstanding as of December 31,   2015   is payable as follows: 

S-8 

Short-term Debt 
    
  Parent s outstanding short-term debt was as follows: 

4.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  Payments on Behalf of Subsidiaries 
    
  Due to occasional time sensitivity and complexity of payments, Parent makes certain insurance, tax and benefit payments on behalf of subsidiary companies.  Parent is then fully reimbursed by the subsidiary companies. 
    
  Short-term Lending to Subsidiaries 
    
  Parent uses a commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of subsidiaries.  The program is used to fund both a Utility Money Pool, which funds the utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain nonutility subsidiaries.  In addition, the program also funds, as direct borrowers, the short-term debt requirements of other subsidiaries that are not participants in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons.  The program also allows some direct borrowers to invest excess cash with Parent. 
    
  Interest expense related to Parent s short-term borrowing is included in Interest Expense on Parent s statements of income.  Parent incurred interest expense for amounts borrowed from subsidiaries of $2 million, $413 thousand and $7 thousand for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
    
  Interest income related to Parent s short-term lending is included in Interest Income on Parent s statements of income.  Parent earned interest income for amounts advanced to subsidiaries of $4 million, $4 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
    
  Global Borrowing Notes 
    
  Parent issued long-term debt, portions of which were loaned to its subsidiaries.  Parent pays interest on the global notes, but the subsidiaries accrue interest for their share of the global borrowing and remit the interest to Parent.  Interest income related to Parent s loans to subsidiaries is included in Interest Income on Parent s statements of income.  Parent earned interest income on loans to subsidiaries of $1 million, $3 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.

Exhibit 10(v) 

   AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER 
  EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN 
    
  (As Amended January 25, 2016) 

By resolution of the Human Resources Committee of American Electric Power Company, Inc. adopted this 25th day of January, 2016, this sets forth the American Electric Power Executive Severance Plan (the  Plan ), as amended and restated. The Plan was initially adopted on January 15, 2014.   
    
  ARTICLE I 
  PURPOSE AND TERM OF PLAN 
    
  Section 1.1      Purpose of the Plan  . The purpose of the Plan is to provide Eligible Employees with certain severance benefits as described in this Plan in the event the Eligible Employee s employment with the American Electric Power System is terminated due to an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation.  
    
  Section 1.2      Characterization and Interpretation of the Plan  .  The Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A and its related regulations and guidance. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, distributions may only be made under the Plan upon an event and in a manner permitted by Code section 409A or an applicable exemption. If a payment is not made by the designated payment date under the Plan, the payment shall be made by December 31 of the calendar year in which the designated payment date occurs. To the extent that any provision of the Plan would cause a conflict with the requirements of Code section 409A, or would cause the administration of the Plan to fail to satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A, such provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent permitted by applicable law. All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Plan may only be made upon a  separation from service  (as that term is defined under Code section 409A and its related regulations and guidance). For purposes of Code section 409A, any right to receive a particular payment or a series of installment payments under this Plan shall be treated as a right to receive separate (or a series of separate) payments. Any right to receive a reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided under the Plan shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Code section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirement that: (i) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during the Participant s lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Plan); (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year; (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred; and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 

Section 1.3      Term and Effect of the Plan  .  
    
  (a)  The Plan generally shall be effective as of the Effective Date and, except to the extent otherwise specified in the Plan, shall supersede any prior plan, program, policy, or agreement under which the AEP System Companies provided severance benefits prior to the Effective Date of the Plan for the Eligible Employees. However, the Plan shall not be construed so as to supersede any prior or existing plan, program, policy or agreement (or any portion of such prior arrangement) pursuant to which an Eligible Employee accrued benefits other than severance benefits. 
    
  (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan shall not: (i) apply to any Employee who is subject to an existing employment or severance agreement pursuant to which the Company or any of the other AEP System Companies has arranged to provide severance benefits to the Employee until the term of such agreement expires (or, if earlier, such date as the Employee executes an acknowledgement that this Plan supersedes such agreement); or (ii) supersede any plan, program, policy or agreement pursuant to which the Company or any of the other AEP System Companies has arranged to provide severance benefits to an Employee in connection with the occurrence of a change in control.  
    
  (c)  The Plan shall continue until terminated pursuant to Article VIII of the Plan.

  Section 2.32     Tier 1 Employee  shall mean the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and such other Eligible Employees who are approved for such classification by the Committee in its sole discretion.

ARTICLE III 
  PARTICIPATION AND ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS 
    
  Section 3.1      Participation  . Each Eligible Employee in the Plan who is a Tier 1 Employee or Tier 2 Employee who incurs an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation (other than an Involuntary Termination or Good Reason Resignation that constitutes a Change in Control Termination) and who satisfies the conditions of Section 3.2 shall be eligible to receive the Severance Benefits described in the Plan. An Eligible Employee shall not be eligible to receive any other severance benefits from the AEP System Companies on account of an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation, unless otherwise provided in the Plan; provided that if the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination of employment of such an Eligible Employee satisfies the requirements to receive the benefits under both this Plan and the General Severance Plan, such Eligible Employee shall not be precluded from receiving benefits under the General Severance Plan, provided that the benefits provided to such a Participant under this Plan shall be adjusted in the manner described in Article X. 
    
  Section 3.2      Conditions  .  
    
  (a)    Eligibility for any Severance Benefits is expressly conditioned on the satisfaction of all of the following conditions: 
    
           (i) 
    an Eligible Employee s written acknowledgment and agreement to comply with the provisions in Article VI during and after the Eligible Employee s employment with the AEP System Companies within such period as may be requested by the Company;  
       
           (ii) 
    to the extent requested by the Company, execution of a written acknowledgement and agreement that this Plan supersedes an existing arrangement that provides severance benefits to the Eligible Employee and/or that the Eligible Employee is no longer entitled to receive severance benefits pursuant to a prior arrangement that has expired;  
       
           (iii) 
    execution and return to the Company of the Release (in the form provided by the Company) by the Participant within 60 days following the Participant s Termination Date (or such shorter period of time specified in the Release); and  
       
           (iv) 
    execution by the Participant of a written agreement that authorizes the deduction of amounts owed to the Company prior to the payment of any Severance Benefits (or in accordance with any other schedule as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine to be appropriate); provided, that the Committee determines in its sole discretion that such deduction is not in violation of Code section 409A.  
       
  (b)    If the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant has not fully complied with any of the terms of the Release, the Committee may deny Severance Benefits 
    8 

not yet in pay status or discontinue the payment of the Participant s Severance Benefits and may require the Participant, by providing written notice of such repayment obligation to the Participant, to repay any portion of the Severance Benefits already received under the Plan. If the Committee notifies a Participant that repayment of all or any portion of the Severance Benefits received under the Plan is required, such amounts shall be repaid within 30 calendar days of the date the written notice is sent. Any remedy under this paragraph (b) shall be in addition to, and not in place of, any other remedy, including injunctive relief, that any AEP System Company may have.  
    
  (c)     An Eligible Employee who experiences a termination of employment that is not an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation shall not be eligible to receive Severance Benefits under the Plan. Specifically, and without limiting the foregoing, an Eligible Employee shall not be eligible to receive Severance Benefits upon the Eligible Employee s:  
    
           (i) 
    voluntary resignation or retirement (other than a voluntary resignation or retirement that constitutes a Good Reason Resignation);  
       
           (ii) 
    Change in Control Termination;  
       
           (iii) 
    resignation of employment (other than a Good Reason Resignation) before the job-end date specified by the Employer or while the Employer still desires the Eligible Employee s services;  
       
           (iv) 
    termination for Cause;  
       
           (v) 
    termination due to death or Permanent Disability; or  
       
           (vi) 
    failure to return to work within six months of the onset of an approved leave of absence to the extent such failure to return to work itself constitutes a separation from service, determined in a manner consistent with the written policies adopted by the Committee from time to time to the extent such policies are consistent with the requirements imposed under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i). 
       
  Further, except under circumstances specified in this Plan, an Eligible Employee shall not be eligible to receive Severance Benefits upon his termination of employment if the Eligible Employee receives severance benefits pursuant to another plan, policy, program or arrangement providing benefits upon a termination of employment or other separation from service.  
    
  (d)    Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Committee has the sole discretion to determine an Eligible Employee s eligibility to receive Severance Benefits. 
    9 

ARTICLE IV 
  DETERMINATION OF SEVERANCE BENEFITS 
    
  Section 4.1      Amount of Severance Benefits Upon Involuntary Termination or Good Reason Resignation  . The Severance Benefits to be provided to a Participant who incurs an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation and who satisfies the conditions of Section 3.2 shall be as follows:  
    
           (a) 
    Salary and Bonus Severance.   Participants shall receive salary and bonus severance as follows:  
       
           (i) 
    Tier 1 Employees shall receive payment equal to 200% of the sum of (A) the Tier 1 Employee s Base Salary, plus (B) the Tier 1 Employee s Target Annual Incentive Payment (with both Base Salary and Target Annual Incentive Payment being determined without regard to any decrease in such Base Salary or Target Annual Incentive Payment that would constitute a basis for a Good Reason Resignation).  
       
           (ii) 
    Tier 2 Employees shall receive payment equal to 100% of the sum of (A) the Tier 2 Employee s Base Salary, plus (B) the Tier 2 Employee s Target Annual Incentive Payment (with both Base Salary and Target Annual Incentive Payment being determined without regard to any decrease in such Base Salary or Target Annual Incentive Payment that would constitute a basis for a Good Reason Resignation).  
       
  (b)      Restricted Stock Unit Awards.   Participants shall be considered to have vested in a fractional portion of the Participant s Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent RSUs) provided that the Participant s Termination may not otherwise lead to their vesting under the terms of the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement issued to the Participant under the LTIP.  The portion of Participant s Granted RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent RSUs) (as those terms are defined in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement) that vest under this provision is determined as follows: 
    
           (i) 
    The number of whole months from the Effective Date defined in the RSU Award Agreement through the Participant s Termination Date divided by the number of whole months from that Effective Date until the final Vesting Date specified in the Vesting Schedule set forth at the beginning of such RSU Award Agreement;  
       
           (ii) 
    Reduced (but not below zero) by the cumulative Percentage of Granted Units for which the Vesting Date specified in the Vesting Schedule has passed as of the date the Participant s Termination Date. 
       
  (c)      Performance Unit Awards.   A Participant shall be eligible to receive a pro-rated share of any outstanding award of Performance Units granted to a Participant in accordance with 
    10 

the terms of the LTIP (a  Performance Unit Award ), provided that the Participant s Termination is not due to Termination of Employment Due to the Participant s Retirement or Triggering Event (as defined in such Performance Unit Award). This pro-rated share of any Performance Unit Award shall be calculated by multiplying: (i) the Performance Unit Award the Participant would have earned for the full performance period based on the performance of the AEP System Companies as determined at the end of the applicable performance period by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months of the Participant s participation from the Grant Date specified in the Performance Unit Award until the Termination Date and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the applicable performance period for the Performance Unit Award.  
    
  (d)    The provisions of this Plan may provide for payments to the Participant under certain compensation or bonus plans of the AEP System Companies under circumstances where such plans would not otherwise provide for payment thereof. It is the specific intention of the Company that the provisions of this Plan shall supersede any provisions to the contrary in such plans, to the extent permitted by applicable law and that such plans not provide benefits that the Company determines to be duplicative of those provided by this Plan, and such plans shall be deemed to have been amended to correspond with this Plan without further action by the Company, the Committee or the Board.  
    
  Section 4.2      Other Terminations  . If the Eligible Employee s employment terminates on account of a reason other than an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation or the Eligible Employee does not otherwise satisfy the conditions of Section 3.2, the Eligible Employee shall not be entitled to receive Severance Benefits under this Plan and shall be entitled only to those benefits (if any) as may be available under the Company s then-existing benefit plans and policies at the time of such termination.  
    
  Section 4.3      Termination for Cause  . If any Eligible Employee s employment terminates on account of termination by the Company for Cause, the Eligible Employee shall not be entitled to receive Severance Benefits under this Plan and shall be entitled only to those benefits that are legally required to be provided to the Eligible Employee. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the Committee determines that an Eligible Employee engaged in conduct that constituted Cause at any time prior to the Eligible Employee s Termination Date, any Severance Benefits payable to the Eligible Employee under Section 4.1 shall immediately cease, and the Eligible Employee shall be required to return any Severance Benefits paid to the Eligible Employee prior to such determination. If the Company has offset other payments owed to the Eligible Employee under any other plan or program, it may, in its sole discretion, waive its repayment right under this Plan solely with respect to the amount of the offset already taken.  
    
  Section 4.4      Reduction of Severance Benefits  . The Plan Administrator reserves the right to make deductions in accordance with applicable law for any monies owed to the AEP System Companies by the Participant or the value of the property of the AEP System Companies that the Participant has retained in his or her possession; provided, however, that no such 
    11 

deduction shall be made if the Company determines that such would be inconsistent with the requirements of Code section 409A.  

ARTICLE V 
  METHOD AND DURATION OF PAYMENT OF SEVERANCE BENEFITS 
    
  Section 5.1      Method of Payment  .  
    
  (a)      Payment of Cash Severance Benefits.   The Severance Benefits described in Sections 4.1(a) to which a Participant is entitled shall be paid to the Participant according to the following payment schedule: 
    
           (i) 
    As of the first regular payroll date of the Company that coincides with or immediately follows the date that is six months after the Participant s Termination Date, a payment equal to 50% (for Tier 2 Employees) or 25% (for Tier 1 Employees) of  the amount of the Severance Benefits described in Section 4.1(a); and 
       
           (ii)

The amount of such reduction shall be based upon the Fair Market Value (as defined in the LTIP) of AEP Common Stock at that time; provided, however, that any reduction to a Participant s vested RSUs for applicable tax withholding shall not exceed such limits as may be applicable to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.   
    
  (e)      Participant s Death; No Interest.    In the event of the Participant s death prior to payment being made, the amount of such payment shall be paid in accordance with the terms of an applicable award, or to the extent not specified by such award, to the Participant s estate.

  unless the Company provides the Eligible Employee with its prior, express written consent.

If any provision of this Article VI shall be deemed unenforceable, in whole or in part, this Article VI shall be deemed to be amended to delete or modify the offending part so as to alter this Article VI to render it valid and enforceable.

ARTICLE VII 
  PLAN ADMINISTRATION; DUTIES OF THE COMPANY, THE COMMITTEE AND 
  THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR; AND CLAIMS 
    
  Section 7.1      Authority and Duties  . It shall be the duty of the Plan Administrator, on the basis of information supplied to it by the Company and the Committee, to properly administer the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall have the full power, authority, and discretion to construe, interpret, and administer the Plan, to make factual determinations, to correct deficiencies therein, and to supply omissions. All decisions, actions, and interpretations of the Plan Administrator shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties, subject only to determinations by the Plan Administrator, with respect to denied claims for Severance Benefits. The Plan Administrator may adopt such rules and regulations and may make such decisions as it deems necessary or desirable for the proper administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall be a  named fiduciary  within the meaning of ERISA.  
    
  Section 7.2      Payment  . Payments of Severance Benefits to Participants shall be made in such amount as determined by the Committee under Article IV (subject to adjustment as set forth in Article X), from the Company s general assets, in accordance with the terms of the Plan, as directed by the Committee. 
    16 

Section 7.3      Discretion  . Any decisions, actions or interpretations to be made under the Plan by the Board, the Committee and the Plan Administrator, acting on behalf of either, shall be made in each of their respective sole discretion, not in any fiduciary capacity and need not be uniformly applied to similarly situated individuals and such decisions, actions or interpretations shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all parties. As a condition of participating in the Plan, each Eligible Employee acknowledges that all decisions and determinations of the Board, the Committee, and the Plan Administrator shall be final and binding on the Eligible Employee, his or her beneficiaries, and any other person having or claiming an interest under the Plan on his or her behalf; provided, however, that the Eligible Employee shall have the right to challenge any such decisions and determinations in accordance with the claims and appeals procedures set forth in Section 7.4 and applicable law.  
    
  Section 7.4      Claims Administration  .  
    
  (a)    Each Participant under this Plan may contest only the calculation and administration of the Severance Benefits awarded by completing and filing with the Plan Administrator a written request for review in the manner specified by the Plan Administrator. No claim or appeal is permissible as to a Participant s eligibility for or amount of Severance Benefits or as to whether a Participant s termination constitutes an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation, which are decisions made solely within the discretion of the Company, and the Committee acting on behalf of the Company. No person may bring an action for any alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits in a court of law unless the claims procedures described in this Article VII are exhausted and a final determination is made by the Plan Administrator. If the terminated Participant or interested person challenges a decision by the Plan Administrator, a review by the court of law will be limited to the facts, evidence and issues presented to the Plan Administrator during the claims procedure set forth in this Article VII. Facts and evidence that become known to the terminated Participant or other interested person after having exhausted the claims procedure must be brought to the attention of the Plan Administrator for reconsideration. Issues not raised with the Plan Administrator will be deemed waived.  
    
  (b)    Before the date on which payment of Severance Benefits commence, each such application must be supported by such information as the Plan Administrator deems relevant and appropriate. In the event that any claim relating to the administration of Severance Benefits is denied in whole or in part, the terminated Participant or his or her beneficiary (the  Claimant ) whose claim has been so denied shall be notified of such denial in writing by the Plan Administrator within 90 days after the receipt of the claim for benefits. This period may be extended an additional 90 days if the Plan Administrator determines such extension is necessary and the Plan Administrator provides notice of extension to the Claimant prior to the end of the initial 90-day period. The notice advising of the denial shall specify the following: (i) the reason or reasons for denial; (ii) make specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the determination was based; (iii) describe any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim (explaining why such material or information is needed); and (iv) describe the Plan s review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, 
    17 

including a statement of the Claimant s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.  
    
  (c)    A Claimant whose claim has been denied shall file with the Plan Administrator a notice of appeal of the denial. Such notice shall be filed within 60 calendar days of notification by the Plan Administrator of the denial of a claim, shall be made in writing, and shall set forth all of the facts upon which the appeal is based. Appeals not timely filed shall be barred. The Plan Administrator shall consider the merits of the Claimant s written presentations, the merits of any facts or evidence in support of the denial of benefits, and such other facts and circumstances as the Plan Administrator shall deem relevant.  
    
  (d)    The Plan Administrator shall render a determination upon the appealed claim which determination shall be accompanied by a written statement as to the reasons therefore. The determination shall be communicated to the Claimant within 60 days of the Claimant s request for review, unless the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim. In such case, the Plan Administrator shall notify the Claimant of the need for an extension of time to render its decision prior to the end of the initial 60-day period, and the Plan Administrator shall have an additional 60-day period to make its determination. The determination so rendered shall be binding upon all parties. If the determination is adverse to the Claimant, the notice shall: (i) provide the reason or reasons for denial; (ii) make specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the determination was based; (iii) include a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the Claimant s claim for benefits; and (iv) state that the Claimant has the right to bring an action under section 502(a) of ERISA.

No such amendment shall give the Company the right to recover any amount paid to a Participant prior to the date of such amendment or to cause the cessation of Severance Benefits already approved for a Participant who has returned to the Company an executed Release as required under Section 3.2 (except as otherwise contemplated by the terms of the Plan).

      AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
    EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
    
  Company Overview 
    
  AEP is one of the largest investor-owned electric public utility holding companies in the United States.  AEP s electric utility operating companies provide generation, transmission and distribution services to more than five million retail customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. 
    
  AEP s subsidiaries operate an extensive portfolio of assets including: 

Approximately 224,000     miles of distribution lines that deliver electricity to 5.4 million customers. 
                
    Approximately 40,000 miles of transmission lines, including 2,114     miles of 765 kV lines, the backbone of the electric interconnection grid in the Eastern United States. 
                
    AEP Transmission Holdco has approximately $2.9 billion of transmission assets in-service. 
                
    Approximately 32,000 megawatts of generating capacity in 3 RTOs, one of the largest complements of generation in the United States. 
                
    Substantial commodity transportation assets (4,838     railcars, 498 barges, 12 towboats, 8 harbor boats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity).   
       
  Customer Demand 
    
  In comparison to 2014, AEP s weather-normalized retail sales decreased 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015.  AEP s industrial sales volumes decreased by 0.2% compared to 2014.  2015 weather-normalized residential and commercial sales decreased 1.8% and 0.2%, respectively, compared to 2014. 
    
  In 2016, AEP anticipates weather-normalized retail sales will increase by 0.9%.  The industrial class is expected to grow by 1.1% in 2016, primarily related to a number of new oil and natural gas expansions, especially around the major shale gas areas within AEP s footprint.  Weather-normalized residential sales are projected to increase by 0.5%, primarily related to projected customer growth.  Weather-normalized commercial class energy sales are projected to increase by 0.9%. 
    
  Merchant Fleet Alternatives 
    
  AEP is evaluating strategic alternatives for its merchant generation fleet, included in the Generation   Marketing segment, which primarily includes AGR s generation fleet and AEGCo s Lawrenceburg Plant, both of which operate in PJM as well as a purchased power agreement related to a 54.7% interest in the Oklaunion Plant which operates in ERCOT.  Potential alternatives may include, but are not limited to, continued ownership of the merchant generation fleet, executing a purchased power agreement with OPCo for certain merchant generation units in Ohio under the filed settlement agreement currently pending with the PUCO or a sale of the merchant generation fleet.  Management has not made a decision regarding the potential alternatives, nor have they set a specific time frame for a decision.  Certain of these alternatives could result in a loss which could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Disposition of AEP River Operations 
    
  In October 2015, AEP signed an agreement to sell its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in November 2015.  AEP received net proceeds of $491 million, which resulted in a net gain of $253 million that was recorded in Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax, on the statement of income.  The nonaffiliated party acquired AEPRO by purchasing all of the common stock of AEP Resources, Inc., the parent company of AEPRO.  The nonaffiliated party assumed certain assets and liabilities of AEPRO, excluding  
    2 

    the investment in IMT, pension and benefit assets and liabilities and debt obligations.  Prior to the closing of the sale, AEP retired the debt obligations of AEPRO.  AEP retained ownership of its captive barge fleet for the company s regulated coal-fueled power plant units owned or leased by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo.  AEP signed a contract with the nonaffiliated party to dispatch and schedule its captive barge fleet for the company s regulated coal-fueled power plant units.  AEP also has a separate contract with the nonaffiliated party to barge coal for AGR.  Both agreements extend through the end of 2016. 
    
  AEPRO s assets and liabilities have been recorded as Assets from Discontinued Operations and Liabilities from Discontinued Operations, respectively, on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2014.  The results of operations of AEPRO have been classified as Discontinued Operations on the statements of income.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
    
  Merchant Portion of Turk Plant 
    
  SWEPCo constructed the Turk Plant, a base load 600 MW pulverized coal ultra-supercritical generating unit in Arkansas, which was placed into service in December 2012 and is included in the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment.  SWEPCo owns 73% (440 MW) of the Turk Plant and operates the facility. 
    
  The APSC granted approval for SWEPCo to build the Turk Plant by issuing a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need (CECPN) for the SWEPCo Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant (approximately 20%).  Following an appeal by certain intervenors, the Arkansas Supreme Court issued a decision that reversed the APSC s grant of the CECPN.  In June 2010, in response to an Arkansas Supreme Court decision, the APSC issued an order which reversed and set aside the previously granted CECPN.  This share of the Turk Plant output is currently not subject to cost-based rate recovery and is being sold into the wholesale market.  Approximately 80% of the Turk Plant investment is recovered under cost-based rate recovery in Texas, Louisiana, and through SWEPCo s wholesale customers under FERC-based rates. 
    
  If SWEPCo cannot ultimately recover its investment and expenses related to the Turk Plant, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Ohio Electric Security Plan Filings 
    
  2009 - 2011 ESP 
    
  In August 2012, the PUCO issued an order in a separate proceeding which implemented a PIRR to recover OPCo s deferred fuel costs in rates beginning September 2012.  In June 2015, the Supreme Court of Ohio issued a decision that reversed, as requested by OPCo, the PUCO order on the carrying cost rate issue and dismissed an appeal filed by the IEU.  In September 2015, the Supreme Court of Ohio denied a request for reconsideration filed by the IEU and in October 2015 this matter was remanded back to the PUCO for reinstatement of the WACC rate.  A decision from the PUCO is pending. 
    
  June 2012 - May 2015 Ohio ESP Including Capacity Charge 
    
  In August 2012, the PUCO issued an order which adopted and modified a new ESP that established base generation rates through May 2015.  This ruling was generally upheld in PUCO rehearing orders in January and March 2013. 
    
  In July 2012, the PUCO issued an order in a separate capacity proceeding which stated that OPCo must charge CRES providers the RPM price and authorized OPCo to defer a portion of its incurred capacity costs not recovered from CRES providers up to $188.88/MW day.  The OPCo RPM price collected from CRES providers, which includes reserve margins, was approximately $34/MW day through May 2014 and $150/MW day from June 2014 through May 2015.  In December 2012, various parties filed notices of appeal of the capacity costs decision with the Supreme Court of Ohio.  Oral arguments at the Supreme Court of Ohio were held in December 2015.  A decision from the Supreme Court of Ohio is pending. 
    3 

    As part of the August 2012 ESP order, the PUCO established a non-bypassable RSR, effective September 2012.  The RSR was collected from customers at $3.50/MWh through May 2014 and at $4.00/MWh for the period June 2014 through May 2015, with $1.00/MWh applied to the recovery of deferred capacity costs.  In April and May 2013, OPCo and various intervenors filed appeals with the Supreme Court of Ohio challenging portions of the PUCO s ESP order, including the RSR.  In April 2015, the PUCO issued an order that approved, with modifications, OPCo s July 2014 application to collect the unrecovered portion of the deferred capacity costs.  In May 2015, the PUCO granted intervenors requests for rehearing.  As of   December 31, 2015  , OPCo s net deferred capacity costs balance was $359 million, including debt carrying costs.  Through   December 31, 2015  , OPCo has collected $222 million in deferred capacity costs, and related carrying charges.   
    
  In 2013, the PUCO issued its Orders on Rehearing for the ESP which generally upheld its August 2012 order.  The PUCO clarified that a final reconciliation of revenues and expenses would be permitted for any over- or under-recovery on several riders including fuel.  In addition, the PUCO addressed certain issues around the energy auctions while other SSO issues related to the energy auctions were deferred to a separate docket related to the competitive bid process (CBP).  In 2013, OPCo and various intervenors filed appeals with the Supreme Court of Ohio challenging portions of the PUCO s ESP order.  Oral arguments at the Supreme Court of Ohio were held in May 2015. 
    
  In November 2013, the PUCO issued an order approving OPCo s competitive bid process with modifications.  The PUCO also approved the unbundling of the FAC into fixed and energy-related components and an intervenor proposal to blend the $188.88/MW day capacity price in proportion to the percentage of energy planned to be auctioned.  Additionally, the PUCO ordered that intervenor concerns related to the recovery of the fixed fuel costs through potentially both the FAC and the approved capacity charges be addressed in subsequent FAC proceedings. 
    
  In January 2014, the PUCO denied all rehearing requests and agreed to issue a supplemental request for an independent auditor in the 2012 - 2013 FAC proceeding to separately examine the recovery of the fixed fuel costs, including OVEC.  In March 2014, the PUCO approved OPCo s request to implement riders related to the unbundling of the FAC.  In October 2014, the independent auditor, selected by the PUCO, filed its report for the period August 2012 through May 2015 with the PUCO.  If the PUCO ultimately concludes that a portion of the fixed fuel costs are also recovered through OPCo s $188.88/MW day capacity charge, the independent auditor has recommended a methodology for calculating a refund of a portion of certain fixed fuel costs.  The retail share of these fixed fuel costs is approximately $90 million annually.  A hearing related to this matter has not been scheduled.  Management believes that no over-recovery of costs has occurred and disagrees with the findings in the audit report. 
    
  If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect all components of its ESP rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  June 2015 - May 2018 ESP Including PPA Application 
    
  In December 2013, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve an ESP that included proposed rate adjustments and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders effective June 2015 through May 2018.  The proposal also included a purchased power agreement (PPA) rider that would allow retail customers to receive a rate stabilizing charge or credit by hedging market-based prices with a cost-based PPA. 
    
  In February 2015, the PUCO issued an order approving OPCo s ESP application, subject to certain modifications, with a return on common equity of 10.2% on capital costs for certain riders.  The order included (a) approval of the Distribution Investment Rider (DIR) with modified rate caps established by the PUCO, (b) authorization to establish a zero rate rider for OPCo s proposed PPA, (c) the option for OPCo to reapply in a future proceeding with a more detailed PPA proposal and (d) a directive to continue to pursue the transfer of the OVEC contractual entitlement to AGR or to otherwise divest of its interest in OVEC.  In May 2015, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing that increased the DIR rate caps and deferred ruling on all requests for rehearing related to the establishment of the PPA rider.  In July 2015, the PUCO granted OPCo s and various intervenors  requests for rehearing related to the May 2015 order.  
    
    4 

    In October 2014, OPCo filed a separate application with the PUCO to propose a new extended PPA with AGR for 2,671 MW for inclusion in the PPA rider and an amended application was filed in May 2015.  In December 2015, a non-unanimous stipulation agreement related to the PPA application was filed with the PUCO.  The stipulation agreement is based upon a 10.38% return on common equity with the PPA Rider term extending through May 2024.  The stipulation agreement included (a) a revised affiliate PPA between OPCo and AGR to be included in the PPA Rider, (b) OPCo s OVEC contractual entitlement, (c) a potential additional customer credit to be included in the PPA Rider, (d) annual compliance reviews before the PUCO and (e) an agreement to retire, refuel or repower, to 100% natural gas, Conesville Plant, Units 5 and 6 and Cardinal Plant, Unit 1 by 2029 and 2030, respectively.  Additionally, OPCo agreed to develop and implement, by 2021, a solar energy project(s) of at least 400 MW and a wind energy project(s) of at least 500 MW, with 100% of all output to be received by OPCo.  OPCo would own up to 50% of these solar and wind projects and would include cost recovery in the proposed PPA rider, subject to PUCO review and approval.  OPCo agreed to file a carbon reduction plan with the PUCO by December 2016 that will focus on fuel diversification and carbon emission reductions.  Hearings related to this proposed stipulation agreement were held in January 2016.  Management anticipates receiving an order from the PUCO in the first quarter of 2016.  In January 2016, intervenors filed a complaint at the FERC related to the affiliate PPA.  The complaint asserts that the proposed affiliate PPA between AGR and OPCo is reviewable by the FERC under its standards for affiliate transactions.  
    
  If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect all components of its ESP rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  See  Ohio Electric Security Plan Filings  section of Note   4  . 
    
  2012 Texas Base Rate Case 
    
  Upon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap.  As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2013, SWEPCo reversed $114 million of previously recorded regulatory disallowances.  The resulting annual base rate increase was approximately $52 million.  In May 2014, intervenors filed appeals of the order with the Texas District Court.  If certain parts of the PUCT order are overturned it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  See the  2012 Texas Base Rate Case  section of Note   4  . 
    
  2012 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing 
    
  In 2012, SWEPCo initiated a proceeding to establish new formula base rates in Louisiana, including recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant.  In February 2013, a settlement was approved by the LPSC that increased SWEPCo s Louisiana total rates by approximately $2 million annually, effective March 2013.  The March 2013 base rates are based upon a 10% return on common equity and cost recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant and Stall Unit, subject to refund.  The settlement also provided that the LPSC will review base rates in 2014 and 2015 and that SWEPCo will recover non-fuel Turk Plant costs and a full weighted-average cost of capital return on the prudently incurred Turk Plant investment in jurisdictional rate base, effective January 2013.  In December 2014, the LPSC approved a settlement agreement related to the staff review of the cost of service.  The settlement agreement reduced the requested revenue increase by $3 million, primarily due to the timing of both the allowed recovery of certain existing regulatory assets and the establishment of a regulatory asset for certain previously expensed costs.  If the LPSC orders refunds based upon the pending prudence review of the Turk Plant investment, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  See the  2012 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing  section of Note   4  .  
    
  Welsh Plant - Environmental Impact 
    
  Management currently estimates that the investment necessary to meet proposed environmental regulations through 2025 for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 could cost approximately $900 million, excluding AFUDC.  As part of this investment, SWEPCo is currently constructing environmental control projects to meet Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 at a cost of approximately $400 million, excluding AFUDC.  As of   December 31, 2015  , SWEPCo had incurred costs of $343 million, including AFUDC, and had remaining contractual construction obligations of $40 million related to these projects.  SWEPCo will seek recovery of these project costs from customers through filings at the state commissions and the FERC.  See  Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs)  
    5 

    Regulation  and  Climate Change, CO   2    Regulation and Energy Policy  sections of  Environmental Issues  below.  Management continues to evaluate the impact of environmental rules and related project cost estimates.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the net book value of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 was $578 million, before cost of removal, including materials and supplies inventory and CWIP.  Welsh Plant, Unit 2 is scheduled for retirement during 2016 and is probable of abandonment.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the net book value of Welsh Plant, Unit 2 was $82 million, before cost of removal, including materials and supplies inventory and CWIP. 
    
  If any of these costs are not recoverable, including retirement-related costs for Welsh Plant, Unit 2, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  2015 Oklahoma Base Rate Case 
    
  In July 2015, PSO filed a request with the OCC to increase annual revenues by $137 million to recover costs associated with its environmental compliance plan and to recover investments and other costs that have increased since the last base rate case.  The annual increase consists of (a) a base rate increase of $89 million, which includes $48 million in increased depreciation expense, (b) a rider or base rate increase of $44 million to recover costs for environmental controls and (c) a request to include environmental consumable costs in the FAC, estimated to be $4 million annually.  The rate increase includes a proposed return on common equity of 10.5% to be effective in January 2016, except for the $44 million for environmental investments, which is effective in March 2016, after the Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 environmental controls go in service. 
    
  In addition, the filing also notified the OCC that the incremental replacement capacity and energy costs, including the first year effects of new PPAs, estimated to be $35 million, will be incurred related to the environmental compliance plan due to the closure of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4 in April 2016, which would be recovered through the FAC. 
    
  In October 2015, testimony was filed by OCC staff and intervenors with recommendations that included increases to base rates and/or the proposed environmental rider ranging from $10 million to $31 million, based upon returns on common equity ranging from 8.75% to 9.3%, and increases to depreciation expense ranging from $23 million to $46 million.  Additionally, recommendations by certain intervenors included (a) no recovery of PSO s investment in Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 environmental controls, (b) no recovery of the plant balances at the time the units are retired in 2016 and 2026, (c) denial of returns on the book values after the retirement dates, or to be set at only the cost of debt, and (d) the disallowance of the capacity costs associated with the PPAs.  Additionally, some intervenors did not support an increase in depreciation expense for the Northeastern Plant, Units 3 and 4 to permit cost recovery by Unit 3 s 2026 retirement date as the proposals called for no change in existing cost recovery by 2040.  Hearings at the OCC were held in December 2015.  In January 2016, PSO implemented an interim annual base rate increase of $75 million, subject to refund pending a final order from the OCC.  If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  See the  2015 Oklahoma Base Rate Case  section of Note   4  .  
    
  ETT Interim Transmission Rates 
    
  Parent has a 50% equity ownership interest in ETT.  Predominantly all of ETT s revenues are based on interim rate changes that can be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next filed base rate proceeding.  As of December 31, 2015, AEP s share of ETT s cumulative revenues, subject to review, is estimated to be $433 million based upon interim rate increases received from 2009 through 2015.      In November 2015, the PUCT ordered ETT to file a base rate case by February 2017.  A base rate review could produce a refund if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim increase was based.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring.  A refund of interim transmission rates could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Kingsport Base Rate Case 
    
  In January 2016, KGPCo refiled its request with the TRA to increase base rates by $12 million annually based upon a proposed return on common equity of 10.66%.  New rates are expected to be implemented in the third quarter of 2016.  See the  Kingsport Base Rate Case  section of Note   4  .  
    6 

    Virginia Legislation Affecting Biennial Reviews 
    
  In February 2015, amendments to Virginia law governing the regulation of investor-owned electric utilities were enacted.  Under the amended Virginia law, APCo s existing generation and distribution base rates are frozen until after the Virginia SCC rules on APCo s next biennial review, which APCo will file in March 2020 for the 2018 and 2019 test years.  These amendments also preclude the Virginia SCC from performing biennial reviews of APCo s earnings for the years 2014 through 2017.  APCo s financial statements adequately address the impact of these amendments.  The new law provides that APCo will absorb its Virginia jurisdictional share of incremental generation and distribution costs incurred during 2014 through 2017 that are associated with severe weather events and/or natural disasters and costs associated with potential asset impairments related to new carbon emission guidelines issued by the Federal EPA. 
    
  In February 2016, certain APCo industrial customers filed a petition with the Virginia SCC requesting the issuance of a declaratory order that finds the amendments to Virginia law suspending biennial reviews unconstitutional and, accordingly, directs APCo to make biennial review filings beginning March 2016.  In February 2016, APCo filed a motion to stay the Virginia SCC s consideration of the petition due to a pending appeal at the Supreme Court of Virginia by industrial customers of a non-related utility regarding the constitutionality of the 2015 amendments.  Oral arguments at the Virginia SCC are scheduled for March 2016.  Management is unable to predict the outcome of these challenges to the Virginia legislation.  If the biennial review process is reinstated in advance of March 2020, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  PJM Capacity Market 
    
  AGR is required to offer all of its available generation capacity in the PJM Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) auction, which is conducted three years in advance of the delivery year. 
    
  Through May 2015, AGR provided generation capacity to OPCo for both switched and non-switched OPCo generation customers.  For switched customers, OPCo paid AGR $188.88/MW day for capacity.  For non-switched OPCo generation customers, OPCo paid AGR its blended tariff rate for capacity consisting of $188.88/MW day for auctioned load and the non-fuel generation portion of its base rate for non-auctioned load.  As of June 2015, AGR s generation resources are compensated through the PJM capacity auction.  Shown below are the RPM results through the June 2017 through May 2018 period: 

In June 2015, FERC approved PJM s proposal to create a new Capacity Performance (CP) product, intended to improve generator performance and reliability during emergency events by allowing higher offers into the RPM auction and imposing greater charges for non-performance during emergency events.  PJM will procure approximately 80% CP and 20% Base Capacity for the June 2018 through May 2019 and June 2019 through May 2020 periods, while transitioning to 100% CP with the June 2020 through May 2021 period.  FERC also approved transition incremental auctions to procure CP for the June 2016 through May 2017 and June 2017 through May 2018 periods.

    In the third quarter of 2015, PJM conducted the two transition auctions.  The transition auctions allowed generators, including AGR, to re-offer cleared capacity that qualifies as CP.  Shown below are the results of the two transition auctions: 

AGR cleared 7,169MW at $134/MW-day for the June 2016 through May 2017 period, replacing the original auction clearing price of $59.37/MW-day.  AGR cleared 6,495MW for the June 2017 through May 2018 period at $151.50/MW-day, replacing the original auction clearing price of $120/MW-day.   
    
  In August 2015, PJM held its first base residual auction implementing CP rules for the June 2018 through May 2019 period.  PJM cleared approximately 81% of the capacity for the June 2018 through May 2019 period as CP and 19% as Base Capacity. AGR cleared 7,209 MW at the CP auction price of $164.77/MW-day. Shown below are the results for the June 2018 through May 2019 period: 

The FERC order exempted Fixed Resource Requirement entities, including APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo, from the CP rules through the delivery period ending May 2019. In July 2015, AEP filed a request seeking rehearing of the FERC order approving CP.  AEP is awaiting an order on its request for rehearing and will continue to advocate for further improvements to the CP rules and the capacity market as a whole through the PJM stakeholder process. 
    
  LITIGATION 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, AEP is involved in employment, commercial, environmental and regulatory litigation.  Since it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, management cannot predict the eventual resolution, timing or amount of any loss, fine or penalty.  Management assesses the probability of loss for each contingency and accrues a liability for cases that have a probable likelihood of loss if the loss can be estimated.  For details on the regulatory proceedings and pending litigation see Note   4     Rate Matters and Note   6     Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.  Adverse results in these proceedings have the potential to reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Rockport Plant Litigation 
    
  In July 2013, the Wilmington Trust Company filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AEGCo and I M alleging that it will be unlawfully burdened by the terms of the modified NSR consent decree after the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease expiration in December 2022.  The terms of the consent decree allow the installation of environmental emission control equipment, repowering or retirement of the unit.  The plaintiff further alleges that the defendants  actions constitute breach of the lease and participation agreement.  The plaintiff seeks a judgment declaring that the defendants breached the lease, must satisfy obligations related to installation of emission control equipment and indemnify the plaintiff.  The New York court granted a motion to transfer this case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  In October 2013, a motion to dismiss the case was filed on behalf of AEGCo and I M.  In January 2015, the court issued an opinion and order granting the motion in part and denying the motion in part.  The court dismissed certain of the plaintiff s claims.  Several claims remain, including the claim for breach of the participation agreement and a claim alleging breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  In June 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion for partial judgment on the claims seeking dismissal of the  
    8 

    breach of participation agreement claim as well as any claim for indemnification of costs associated with this case.  The plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint to add another claim under the lease and also filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  In November 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion to strike the plaintiff s motion for partial judgment and filed a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim.  Management will continue to defend against the remaining claims.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring. 
    
  ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
    
  AEP is implementing a substantial capital investment program and incurring additional operational costs to comply with environmental control requirements.  Additional investments and operational changes will need to be made in response to existing and anticipated requirements such as CAA requirements to reduce emissions of SO   2   , NO   x   , PM, CO   2    and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from fossil fuel-fired power plants, rules governing the beneficial use and disposal of coal combustion products, clean water rules and renewal permits for certain water discharges. 
    
  AEP is engaged in litigation about environmental issues, was notified of potential responsibility for the clean-up of contaminated sites and incurred costs for disposal of SNF and future decommissioning of the nuclear units.  AEP, along with various industry groups, affected states and other parties challenged some of the Federal EPA requirements in court.  Management is also engaged in the development of possible future requirements including the items discussed below and state plans to reduce CO   2    emissions to address concerns about global climate change.  Management believes that further analysis and better coordination of these environmental requirements would facilitate planning and lower overall compliance costs while achieving the same environmental goals. 
    
  AEP will seek recovery of expenditures for pollution control technologies and associated costs from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Environmental rules could result in accelerated depreciation, impairment of assets or regulatory disallowances.  If AEP is unable to recover the costs of environmental compliance, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Environmental Controls Impact on the Generating Fleet 
    
  The rules and proposed environmental controls discussed in the next several sections will have a material impact on the generating units in the AEP System.  Management continues to evaluate the impact of these rules, project scope and technology available to achieve compliance.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the AEP System had a total generating capacity of approximately 32,000 MWs, of which approximately 18,000 MWs are coal-fired.  Management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with these rules and other impacts of the environmental proposals on the fossil generating facilities.  Based upon management estimates, AEP s investment to meet these proposed requirements ranges from approximately $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion through 2025.  These amounts include investments to convert some of the coal generation to natural gas.   
    
  The cost estimates will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in the final rules.  The cost estimates will also change based on: (a) the states  implementation of these regulatory programs, including the potential for state implementation plans (SIPs) or federal implementation plans (FIPs) that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired and replaced, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and (g) other factors.  In addition, management is continuing to evaluate the economic feasibility of environmental investments on both regulated and nonregulated plants. 
    
    9 

    In May 2015, AEP retired the following plants or units of plants: 

As of December 31,   2015  , the net book value of the AGR units listed above was zero.  The net book value before cost of removal, including related materials and supplies inventory and CWIP balances, of the regulated plants in the table above was approved for recovery, except for $148 million which is pending regulatory approval. 
    
  Subject to the factors listed above and based upon continuing evaluation, management intends to retire the following units of plants during 2016: 

As of December 31,   2015  , the net book value before cost of removal, including related materials and supplies inventory and CWIP balances, of the PSO and SWEPCo units listed above was $176 million.  For Northeastern Station, Unit 4, management is seeking regulatory recovery of remaining net book values.  For Welsh Plant, Unit 2, management will seek regulatory recovery of remaining net book values.   
    
  In October 2015, management obtained permits following the KPSC s approval for the conversion of KPCo s 278 MW Big Sandy Plant, Unit 1 to natural gas.  Management expects to begin operations as a natural gas unit in the second quarter of 2016.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the net book value, before cost of removal, including related materials and supplies inventory and CWIP balances of Big Sandy Plant, Unit 1 was $91 million.  
    
  Management is in the process of obtaining permits following the Virginia SCC s and WVPSC s approval for the conversion of APCo s 470 MW Clinch River Plant, Units 1 and 2 to natural gas.  In the third and fourth quarters of 2015, APCo retired the coal-related assets of Clinch River Plant, Units 1 and 2.  For Clinch River Plant, Unit 3, which was retired in 2015, $23 million is pending regulatory approval.  Management expects to begin operations as a natural gas unit in the first quarter of 2016 for Clinch River Plant, Unit 1 and the second quarter of 2016 for Clinch River Plant, Unit 2.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the net book value before cost of removal, including related materials and supplies inventory and CWIP balances, of Clinch River Plant, Units 1 and 2 was $143 million. 
    
  To the extent existing generation assets and the cost of new equipment and converted facilities are not recoverable, it could materially reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

    Clean Air Act Requirements 
    
  The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation s air quality and control sources of air emissions.  The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements.   
    
  The Federal EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in 2005 requiring specific reductions in SO   2    and NO   x    emissions from power plants.  The Federal EPA issued the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) in August 2011 to replace CAIR.  The CSAPR was challenged in the courts.  In 2012, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision vacating and remanding CSAPR to the Federal EPA with instructions to continue implementing CAIR until a replacement rule is finalized.  That decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which reversed the decision and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered CSAPR to take effect on January 1, 2015 while the remand proceeding was still pending.  In July 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the rule to the Federal EPA.  All of the states in which AEP s power plants are located are covered by CSAPR.  See  Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)  section below. 
    
  The Federal EPA issued the final maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for coal and oil-fired power plants in 2012.  See  Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) Regulation  section below.  
    
  The Federal EPA issued a Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), detailing how the CAA s requirement that certain facilities install best available retrofit technology (BART) will address regional haze in federal parks and other protected areas.  BART requirements apply to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power plants.  CAVR will be implemented through SIPs or, if SIPs are not adequate or are not developed on schedule, through FIPs.  The Federal EPA proposed disapproval of SIPs in a few states, including Arkansas.  In March 2012, the Federal EPA disapproved certain portions of the Arkansas regional haze SIP.  In April 2015, the Federal EPA published a proposed FIP to replace the disapproved portions, including revised BART determinations for the Flint Creek Plant that are consistent with the environmental controls currently under construction.  In June 2012, the Federal EPA published revisions to the regional haze rules to allow states participating in the CSAPR trading programs to use those programs in place of source-specific BART for SO   2    and NO   x    emissions based on its determination that CSAPR results in greater visibility improvements than source-specific BART in the CSAPR states.  This rule is being challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  In July 2015, management submitted comments to the proposed Arkansas FIP and participated in comments filed by industry associations of which AEP is a member.  Management supports compliance with CSAPR programs as satisfaction of the BART requirements.  
    
  The Federal EPA issued rules for CO   2    emissions that apply to new and existing electric utility units.  See  Climate Change, CO   2    Regulation and Energy Policy  section below. 
    
  The Federal EPA also issued new, more stringent national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for PM, SO   2    and ozone.  In October 2015, the Federal EPA announced a lower final NAAQS for ozone of 70 parts per billion.  States are in the process of evaluating the attainment status and need for additional control measures in order to attain and maintain the new NAAQS and may develop additional requirements for facilities as a result of those evaluations.  Management cannot currently predict the nature, stringency or timing of those requirements. 
    
  Notable developments in significant CAA regulatory requirements affecting AEP s operations are discussed in the following sections. 
    11 

    Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) 
    
  In 2011, the Federal EPA issued CSAPR.  Certain revisions to the rule were finalized in 2012.  CSAPR relies on newly-created SO   2    and NO   x    allowances and individual state budgets to compel further emission reductions from electric utility generating units in 28 states.  Interstate trading of allowances is allowed on a restricted sub-regional basis.  Arkansas and Louisiana are subject only to the seasonal NO   x    program in the rule.  Texas is subject to the annual programs for SO   2    and NO   x    in addition to the seasonal NO   x    program.  The annual SO   2    allowance budgets in Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia were reduced significantly in the rule.  A supplemental rule includes Oklahoma in the seasonal NO   x    program.  The supplemental rule was finalized in December 2011 with an increased NO   x    emission budget for the 2012 compliance year.  The Federal EPA issued a final Error Corrections Rule and further CSAPR revisions in 2012 to make corrections to state budgets and unit allocations and to remove the restrictions on interstate trading in the first phase of CSAPR. 
    
  Numerous affected entities, states and other parties filed petitions to review the CSAPR in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  In 2012, the court issued a decision vacating and remanding CSAPR to the Federal EPA with instructions to continue implementing CAIR until a replacement rule is finalized.  The majority determined that the CAA does not allow the Federal EPA to  overcontrol  emissions in an upwind state and that the Federal EPA exceeded its statutory authority by failing to allow states an opportunity to develop their own implementation plans before issuing a FIP.  A petition for review filed by the Federal EPA and other parties in the U.S. Supreme Court was granted in June 2013.  In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision reversing in part the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and remanding the case for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.  The Federal EPA filed a motion to lift the stay and allow Phase I of CSAPR to take effect on January 1, 2015 and Phase II to take effect on January 1, 2017.  The court granted the Federal EPA s motion.  The parties filed briefs and presented oral arguments.  In July 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that the Federal EPA over-controlled the SO   2    and/or NO   x    budgets of 14 states.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the rule to the Federal EPA to timely revise the rule consistent with the court s opinion while CSAPR remains in place.  
    
  In December 2015, the Federal EPA issued a proposal to revise the ozone season NO   x    budgets in 23 states beginning in 2017 to address transport issues associated with the 2008 ozone standard and the budget errors identified in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit s July 2015 decision.  The proposal was open for public comment through February 1, 2016.  Management believes that the Federal EPA mistakenly relied on future projected retirements and failed to take into account actual operating experience when establishing the 2017 budgets.  Management also believes there is insufficient time to implement the required reductions.  
    
  Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) Regulation 
    
  In 2012, the Federal EPA issued a rule addressing a broad range of HAPs from coal and oil-fired power plants.  The rule establishes unit-specific emission rates for units burning coal on a 30-day rolling average basis for mercury, PM (as a surrogate for particles of nonmercury metals) and hydrogen chloride (as a surrogate for acid gases).  In addition, the rule proposes work practice standards, such as boiler tune-ups, for controlling emissions of organic HAPs and dioxin/furans.  The effective date of the final rule was April 16, 2012 and compliance was required within three years.  Management obtained a one-year administrative extension at several units to facilitate the installation of controls or to avoid a serious reliability problem.  In addition, the Federal EPA issued an enforcement policy describing the circumstances under which an administrative consent order might be issued to provide a fifth year for the installation of controls or completion of reliability upgrades.  
    
  In April 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied all of the petitions for review of the April 2012 final rule.  Industry trade groups and several states filed petitions for further review in the U.S. Supreme Court and the court granted those petitions in November 2014.  
    
    12 

    In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the MATS rule for further proceedings consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court s decision that the Federal EPA was unreasonable in refusing to consider costs in its determination whether to regulate emissions of HAPs from power plants.  The Federal EPA issued notice of a supplemental finding concluding that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate HAP emissions from coal-fired and oil-fired units. Management submitted comments on the proposal and will continue to monitor future regulatory developments.  The rule remains in effect. 
    
  Climate Change, CO   2    Regulation and Energy Policy 
    
  The majority of the states where AEP has generating facilities passed legislation establishing renewable energy, alternative energy and/or energy efficiency requirements that can assist in reducing carbon emissions.  Management is taking steps to comply with these requirements, including increasing wind power purchases and broadening the AEP System s portfolio of energy efficiency programs.   
    
  In October 2015, the Federal EPA published the final standards for new, modified and reconstructed fossil fired steam generating units and combustion turbines, and final guidelines for the development of state plans to regulate CO   2    emissions from existing sources.  The final standard for new combustion turbines is 1,000 pounds of CO   2    per MWh and the final standard for new fossil steam units is 1,400 pounds of CO   2    per MWh.  Reconstructed turbines are subject to the same standard as new units and no standard for modified combustion turbines was issued.  Reconstructed fossil steam units are subject to a standard of 1,800 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for larger units and 2,000 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for smaller units.  Modified fossil steam units will be subject to a site specific standard no lower than the standards that would be applied if the units were reconstructed.  
    
  The final emissions guidelines for existing sources, known as the Clean Power Plan, are based on a series of declining emission rates that are implemented beginning in 2022 through 2029.  The final emission rate is 771 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for existing natural gas combined cycle units and 1,305 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for existing fossil steam units in 2030 and thereafter.  The Federal EPA also developed a set of rate-based and mass-based state goals. 
    
  The Federal EPA also published proposed  model  rules that can be adopted by the states that would allow sources within  trading ready  state programs to trade, bank or sell allowances or credits issued by the states.  These rules would also be the basis for any federal plan issued by the Federal EPA in a state that fails to submit or receive approval for a state plan.  The Federal EPA intends to finalize either a rate-based or mass-based trading program that can be enforced in states that fail to submit approved plans by the deadlines established in the final guidelines.  States are required to submit final plans or an extension request by September 2016 to the Federal EPA.  States receiving an extension request must submit final plans by September 2018.  Management is reviewing the final rules and evaluating the rule s impacts as well as the anticipated actions by states where assets are located.  The final rules are being challenged in the courts.  In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on the final Clean Power Plan, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans.  The stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court considers any petition for review.  The Federal EPA established a 90-day public comment period on the proposed rules and management submitted comments. 
    
  Federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of CO   2    could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, which in turn, could lead to increased liquidity needs and higher financing costs.  Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force AEP to close some coal-fired facilities and could lead to possible impairment of assets. 
    
  Coal Combustion Residual Rule 
    
  In April 2015, the Federal EPA published a final rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals (CCR), including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired electric generating units and also FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants.   
    13 

    The final rule became effective in October 2015.  The Federal EPA will regulate CCR as a non-hazardous solid waste and issued new minimum federal solid waste management standards.  The rule applies to new and existing active CCR landfills and CCR surface impoundments at operating electric utility or independent power production facilities.  The rule imposes new and additional construction and operating obligations, including location restrictions, liner criteria, structural integrity requirements for impoundments, operating criteria and additional groundwater monitoring requirements.  The rule does not apply to inactive CCR landfills and inactive surface impoundments at retired generating stations or the beneficial use of CCR.  The rule is self-implementing so state action is not required.  Because of this self-implementing feature, the rule contains extensive record keeping, notice and internet posting requirements.  The CCR rule requirements contain a compliance schedule spanning an approximate four year implementation period.  If CCR units do not meet these standards within the timeframes provided, they will be required to close.  Extensions of time for closure are available provided there is no alternative disposal capacity or the owner can certify cessation of a boiler by a certain date.  Challenges to the rule by industry associations of which AEP is a member are proceeding.  
    
  Because AEP currently uses surface impoundments and landfills to manage CCR materials at generating facilities, significant costs will be incurred to upgrade or close and replace these existing facilities at some point in the future as the new rule is implemented.  Management recorded a $95 million increase in asset retirement obligations in the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to the publication of the final rule.  Management will continue to evaluate the rule s impact on operations.  
    
  In February 2014, the Federal EPA completed a risk evaluation of the beneficial uses of coal fly ash in concrete and FGD gypsum in wallboard and concluded that the Federal EPA supports these beneficial uses.  Currently, approximately 40% of the coal ash and other residual products from AEP s generating facilities are re-used in the production of cement and wallboard, as structural fill or soil amendments, as abrasives or road treatment materials and for other beneficial uses.  Encapsulated beneficial uses are not materially impacted by the new rule but additional demonstrations may be required to continue land applications in significant amounts except in road construction projects.  
    
  Clean Water Act (CWA) Regulations 
    
  In 2014, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant s cooling water intake screen (impingement) or entrained in the cooling water.  Entrainment is when small fish, eggs or larvae are drawn into the cooling water system and affected by heat, chemicals or physical stress.  The final rule affects all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day.  The rule offers seven technology options to comply with the impingement standard and requires site-specific studies to determine appropriate entrainment compliance measures at facilities withdrawing more than 125 million gallons per day.  Additional requirements may be imposed as a result of consultation with other federal agencies to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats.  Facilities with existing closed cycle recirculating cooling systems, as defined in the rule, are not expected to require any technology changes.  Facilities subject to both the impingement standard and site-specific entrainment studies will typically be given at least three years to conduct and submit the results of those studies to the permit agency.  Compliance timeframes will then be established by the permit agency through each facility s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for installation of any required technology changes, as those permits are renewed over the next five to eight years.  Petitions for review of the final rule were filed by industry and environmental groups and are currently pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    
  In addition, the Federal EPA developed revised effluent limitation guidelines for electricity generating facilities.  A final rule was issued in November 2015.  In addition to other requirements, the final rule establishes limits on flue gas desulfurization wastewater, zero discharge for fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater.  The applicability of these requirements is as soon as possible after November 2018 and no later than December 2023.  These new requirements will be implemented through each facility s wastewater discharge permit.  Management will continue to review the final rule in detail to evaluate whether the plants are currently meeting the proposed limitations, what technologies are incorporated into AEP s long-range plans and what additional costs might be incurred.  Management is assessing technology additions and retrofits. 
    14 

    In June 2015, the Federal EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jointly issued a final rule to clarify the scope of the regulatory definition of  waters of the United States  in light of recent U.S. Supreme Court cases.  The CWA provides for federal jurisdiction over  navigable waters  defined as  the waters of the United States.   This jurisdictional definition applies to all CWA programs, potentially impacting generation, transmission and distribution permitting and compliance requirements.  Among those programs are: permits for wastewater and storm water discharges, permits for impacts to wetlands and water bodies and oil spill prevention planning.  The final definition continues to recognize traditional navigable waters of the U.S. as jurisdictional as well as certain exclusions. The rule also contains a number of new specific definitions and criteria for determining whether certain other waters are jurisdictional because of a  significant nexus.   Management believes that clarity and efficiency in the permitting process is needed.  Management remains concerned that the rule introduces new concepts and could subject more of AEP s operations to CWA jurisdiction, thereby increasing the time and complexity of permitting.  The final rule is being challenged in both courts of appeal and district courts.  Challengers include industry associations of which AEP is a member.  The U.S. Court of Appeal for the Sixth Circuit granted a nationwide stay of the rule pending jurisdictional determinations. 
    
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  SEGMENTS 
    
  AEP s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.  Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight.  Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. 
    
  AEP s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below: 
    
  Vertically Integrated Utilities 

Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. 
       
  Transmission and Distribution Utilities 

Transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by OPCo, TCC and TNC. 
                
    OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve SSO customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load. 
       
  AEP Transmission Holdco 

Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEP s wholly-owned transmission subsidiaries and transmission only joint ventures.  These investments have PUCT-approved or FERC-approved returns on equity. 
       
  Generation   Marketing 

Nonregulated generation in ERCOT and PJM. 
                
    Marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO. 
       
  The remainder of AEP s activities are presented as Corporate and Other.  While not considered a reportable segment, Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries, Parent s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income and interest expense and other nonallocated costs.  With the sale of AEPRO in November 2015, the activities related to the AEP River Operations segment have been moved to Corporate and Other for the periods presented.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
    15 

    The table below presents Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders by segment for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . 

AEP CONSOLIDATED 
    
  2015   Compared to   2014    
    
  Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders increased from $1.6 billion in   2014   to $2 billion in   2015   primarily due to: 

Successful rate proceedings during 2015 in AEP s various jurisdictions. 
                
    The gain on the sale of commercial barge operations. 
                
    An increase in transmission investment which resulted in higher revenues and income. 
                
    A decrease in expenses due to a settlement and revision of certain asset retirement obligations. 
                
    Favorable retail, trading and marketing activity. 
       
  These increases were partially offset by: 

A decrease in generation revenues due to lower capacity revenue.

The major components of the decrease in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, purchased electricity and certain cost of service for retail operations were as follows: 

Generation   decreased $204 million primarily due to lower capacity revenue due to the termination of the Power Supply Agreement between AGR and OPCo in May 2015. 
                
    Retail, Trading and Marketing   increased $43 million primarily due to favorable wholesale trading and marketing performance as well as an increase in retail volumes. 
       
  Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses decreased $141 million primarily due to a settlement and revision of certain asset retirement obligations and decreased plant outage and maintenance costs. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses decreased $25 million primarily due to reduced plant in-service. 
                
    Taxes Other Than Income Taxes   decreased $9 million primarily due to a decrease in property taxes. 
                
    Interest Expense   decreased $5 million primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances and lower long-term interest rates.

  (in millions) 

The major components of the decrease in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, purchased electricity and certain cost of service for retail operations were as follows: 

Generation   increased $57 million primarily due to $111 million of increased demand and market prices driven by cold temperatures in the first quarter of 2014, partially offset by $54 million due to the termination of a long-term coal contract. 
       
  Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $27 million primarily due to increased asset retirement obligation costs related to planned retirements. 
                
    Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges   decreased $154 million due to the 2013 impairment of Muskingum River Plant, Unit 5. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses decreased $9 million primarily due to the 2013 impairment of Muskingum River Plant, Unit 5.

    CORPORATE AND OTHER 
    
  2015   Compared to   2014 
    
  Earnings attributable to AEP Common Shareholders from Corporate and Other increased from $53 million in 2014 to $242 million in 2015 primarily due to the gain on the sale of AEP River Operations that was recorded in Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax, on the statement of income.  
    
  2014   Compared to   2013 
    
  Earnings attributable to AEP Common Shareholders from Corporate and Other decreased from $137 million in 2013 to $53 million in 2014 primarily due to a favorable U.K. Windfall Tax decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase in AEP River Operations due to a 28% increase in barge freight revenue for 2014 compared to 2013.  The increase in 2014 freight revenue over 2013 was driven by strong barge freight demand particularly for export grain, strong northbound imports of fertilizer, salt and steel and increased shipments of domestic coal. 
    
  AEP SYSTEM INCOME TAXES 
    
  2015   Compared to   2014 
    
  Income Tax Expense increased $17 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income, partially offset by the recording of state income tax adjustments and other book/tax differences which are accounted for on a flow-through basis. 
    
  2014   Compared to   2013 
    
  Income Tax Expense increased $258 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income and the recording of state income tax adjustments and by a favorable U.K. Windfall Tax decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013. 
    
    FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  AEP measures financial condition by the strength of its balance sheet and the liquidity provided by its cash flows. 
    
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Debt and Equity Capitalization 

(a) 
    Amount excludes $83 million of Long-term Debt classified as Liabilities from Discontinued Operations on the balance sheet.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
       
  AEP s ratio of debt-to-total capital improved from 54.2% as of December 31,   2014   to 53.2% as of December 31,   2015   primarily due to an increase in common equity from earnings. 
    
    35 

    Liquidity 
    
  Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining AEP s financial stability.  Management believes AEP has adequate liquidity under its existing credit facilities.  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP had $3.5 billion in aggregate credit facility commitments to support its operations.  Additional liquidity is available from cash from operations and a receivables securitization agreement.  Management is committed to maintaining adequate liquidity.  AEP generally uses short-term borrowings to fund working capital needs, property acquisitions and construction until long-term funding is arranged.  Sources of long-term funding include issuance of long-term debt, sale-leaseback or leasing agreements or common stock. 
    
  Commercial Paper Credit Facilities 
    
  AEP manages liquidity by maintaining adequate external financing commitments.  As of December 31,   2015  , available liquidity was approximately $3.5 billion as illustrated in the table below: 

AEP has credit facilities totaling $3.5 billion to support its commercial paper program.  The credit facilities allow management to issue letters of credit in an amount up to $1.2 billion. 
    
  AEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries.  The program is used to fund both a Utility Money Pool, which funds the utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain nonutility subsidiaries.  In addition, the program also funds, as direct borrowers, the short-term debt requirements of other subsidiaries that are not participants in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons.  The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during   2015   was $788 million.  The weighted-average interest rate for AEP s commercial paper during   2015   was 0.46%. 
    
  Other Credit Facilities 
    
  An uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility.  AEP issues letters of credit under three uncommitted facilities totaling $225 million.  As of December 31,   2015  , the maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities was $125 million with maturities ranging from June 2016 to December 2016.   
    
  Financing Plan 
    
  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP has $1.8 billion of long-term debt due within one year which includes $607 million of Pollution Control Bonds with mandatory tender dates and credit support for variable interest rates that requires the debt be classified as current.  Also included in AEP s long-term debt due within one year is $407 million of securitization bonds and DCC Fuel notes which will be repaid.  Management plans to refinance the majority of the other maturities due within one year. 
    36 

    Securitized Accounts Receivables 
    
  AEP s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of $750 million from bank conduits to purchase receivables.  The agreement expires in June 2017.   
    
  Debt Covenants and Borrowing Limitations 
    
  AEP s credit agreements contain certain covenants and require it to maintain a percentage of debt to total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%.  The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually defined in AEP s credit agreements.  Debt as defined in the revolving credit agreements excludes securitization bonds and debt of AEP Credit.  As of December 31,   2015  , this contractually-defined percentage was 50.2%.  Nonperformance under these covenants could result in an event of default under these credit agreements.  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP complied with all of the covenants contained in these credit agreements.  In addition, the acceleration of AEP s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of AEP s major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements.  This condition also applies in a majority of AEP s non-exchange traded commodity contracts and would similarly allow lenders and counterparties to declare the outstanding amounts payable.  However, a default under AEP s non-exchange traded commodity contracts would not cause an event of default under its credit agreements. 
    
  The revolving credit facilities do not permit the lenders to refuse a draw on any facility if a material adverse change occurs. 
    
  Utility Money Pool borrowings and external borrowings may not exceed amounts authorized by regulatory orders and AEP manages its borrowings to stay within those authorized limits. 
    
  Dividend Policy and Restrictions 
    
  The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share in January   2016  .  Future dividends may vary depending upon AEP s profit levels, operating cash flow levels and capital requirements, as well as financial and other business conditions existing at the time.  Parent s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries.  Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends.   
    
  Management does not believe these restrictions related to AEP s various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements will have any significant impact on its ability to access cash to meet the payment of dividends on its common stock. 
    
  Credit Ratings 
    
  AEP does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit downgrade, but its access to the commercial paper market may depend on their credit ratings.  In addition, downgrades in AEP s credit ratings by one of the rating agencies could increase its borrowing costs.  Counterparty concerns about the credit quality of AEP or its utility subsidiaries could subject AEP to additional collateral demands under adequate assurance clauses under its derivative and non-derivative energy contracts. 
    
    37 

    CASH FLOW 
    
  AEP relies primarily on cash flows from operations, debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and investing activities.  AEP s investing and capital requirements are primarily capital expenditures, repaying of long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. 

AEP uses short-term debt, including commercial paper, as a bridge to long-term debt financing.  The levels of borrowing may vary significantly due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows. 
    
  Operating Activities 

Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities were $4.7 billion in   2015   consisting primarily of Income from Continuing Operations of $1.8 billion and $2 billion of noncash Depreciation and Amortization.  Other changes represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital, as well as items that represent future rights or obligations to receive or pay cash, such as regulatory assets and liabilities.      Deferred Income Taxes increased primarily due to provisions in the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 and an increase in tax versus book temporary differences from operations.   
    
  Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities were $4.6 billion in   2014   consisting primarily of Income from Continuing Operations of $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion of noncash Depreciation and Amortization.  Other changes represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital, as well as items that represent future rights or obligations to receive or pay cash, such as regulatory assets and liabilities.  Deferred Income Taxes increased primarily due to provisions in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 and an increase in tax versus book temporary differences from operations.  The reduction in Fuel, Material and Supplies balance reflects a decrease in fuel inventory due to cold winter weather and increased generation. 
    
  Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities were $4.1 billion in   2013   consisting primarily of Income from Continuing Operations of $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion of noncash Depreciation and Amortization and $226 million of Asset Impairments related to Muskingum River Plant, Unit 5, Big Sandy and Amos Plants, partially offset by $214 million of Ohio capacity deferrals as a result of a 2012 PUCO order.  Other changes represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital, as well as items that represent future rights or obligations to receive or pay cash, such as regulatory assets and liabilities.  Deferred Income Taxes increased primarily due to provisions in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and an increase in tax versus book temporary differences from operations.  Significant changes in other items include the favorable impact of a decrease in fuel inventory and net cash flows for Accrued Taxes as a result of the recognition of the tax benefit related to the U.K. Windfall Tax.

    Investing Activities 

Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Investing Activities were $4.6 billion in   2015   primarily due to Construction Expenditures for generation, distribution and transmission investments.  
    
  Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Investing Activities were $4.4 billion in   2014   primarily due to Construction Expenditures for generation, distribution and transmission investments.  AEP also purchased transmission assets for $38 million. 
    
  Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Investing Activities were $3.8 billion in   2013   primarily due to Construction Expenditures for generation, distribution and transmission investments. 
    
  Financing Activities 

Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Financing Activities in   2015   were $662 million.  AEP s net debt issuances were $493 million.  The net issuances included issuances of $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes, $140 million of pollution control bonds and $1.2 billion of other debt notes offset by retirements of $1 billion of senior unsecured notes, $342 million of securitization bonds, $308 of pollution control bonds and $716 million of other debt notes and a decrease in short term borrowing of $546 million.  AEP paid common stock dividends of $1.1 billion.  See Note   14     Financing Activities. 
    
  Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Financing Activities in   2014   were $151 million.  AEP s net debt issuances were $879 million.  The net issuances included issuances of $1.6 billion of senior unsecured notes and other debt notes, $444 million of pollution control bonds and an increase in short-term borrowing of $589 million offset by retirements of $1.1 billion of notes, $412 million of pollution control bonds and $306 million of securitization bonds.  AEP paid common stock dividends of $998 million.  See Note   14     Financing Activities. 
    
  Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Financing Activities in   2013   were $439 million.  AEP s net debt issuances were $388 million.

AEP paid common stock dividends of $954 million. 
    39 

    Cash Flow Activity from Discontinued Operations 
    
  In October 2015, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in November 2015 and resulted in net cash proceeds from the sale of $491 million, which were immediately available for use in AEP s continuing operations.  The cash proceeds of $539 million were recorded in Discontinued Investing Activities.  These proceeds were reduced by a make whole payment on the extinguishment of AEPRO long-term debt of $32 million, which was recorded in Discontinued Financing Activities, and transaction costs of $16 million, which were recorded in Discontinued Operating Activities.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
    
  The following financing activities occurred during   2015  : 
    
  AEP Common Stock: 

During 2015, AEP issued 1.7 million shares of common stock under the incentive compensation, employee saving and dividend reinvestment plans and received net proceeds of $82 million. 
       
  Debt: 

During 2015, AEP issued approximately $3.5 billion of long-term debt, including $2.1 billion of senior notes at interest rates ranging from 3.17% to 4.71%, $140 million of pollution control revenue bonds at interest rates ranging from 1.6% to 1.9%, and $1.2 billion of other debt at variable interest rates.  The proceeds from these issuances were used to fund long-term debt maturities and construction programs. 
                
    During 2015, AEP did not enter into any interest rate derivatives and settled $5 million of such transactions.  The settlements resulted in net cash received of $3 million.  As of December 31, 2015, AEP had in place $810 million of notional interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow and fair value hedges. 
       
  In 2016: 
    
          40 

    BUDGETED CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES  
    
  Management forecasts approximately $5 billion of construction expenditures in 2016.  For both 2017 and 2018, management forecasts construction expenditures of $5 billion.  The expenditures are generally for transmission, generation, distribution and required environmental investment to comply with the Federal EPA rules.  Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, weather, legal reviews and the ability to access capital.  Management expects to fund these construction expenditures through cash flows from operations and financing activities.  Generally, the Registrant Subsidiaries use cash or short-term borrowings under the money pool to fund these expenditures until long-term funding is arranged.  The 2016 estimated construction expenditures include generation, transmission and distribution related investments, as well as expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations as follows: 

The 2016 estimated construction expenditures by Registrant Subsidiary include distribution, transmission and generation related investments, as well as expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations as follows: 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  AEP s current guidelines restrict the use of off-balance sheet financing entities or structures to traditional operating lease arrangements that AEP enters in the normal course of business.  The following identifies significant off-balance sheet arrangements. 
    
  Rockport Plant, Unit 2 
    
  AEGCo and I M entered into a sale-and-leaseback transaction in 1989 with Wilmington Trust Company (Owner Trustee), an unrelated unconsolidated trustee for Rockport Plant, Unit 2 (the Plant).  The Owner Trustee was capitalized with equity from six owner participants with no relationship to AEP or any of its subsidiaries and debt from a syndicate of banks and certain institutional investors.  The future minimum lease payments for AEGCo and I M are $517 million each as of December 31,   2015  . 
    
  The gain from the sale was deferred and is being amortized over the term of the lease, which expires in 2022.  The Owner Trustee owns the Plant and leases it to AEGCo and I M.  AEP s subsidiaries account for the lease as an operating lease with the future payment obligations included in Note   13  .  The lease term is for 33 years with potential renewal options.  At the end of the lease term, AEGCo and I M have the option to renew the lease or the Owner Trustee can sell the Plant.  AEP, as well as AEP s subsidiaries, have no ownership interest in the Owner Trustee and do not guarantee its debt. 
    41 

    Railcars 
    
  In June 2003, AEP entered into an agreement with BTM Capital Corporation, as lessor, to lease 875 coal-transporting aluminum railcars.  The initial lease term was five years with three consecutive five-year renewal periods for a maximum lease term of twenty years.  AEP intends to maintain the lease for the full lease term of twenty years via the renewal options.  The lease is accounted for as an operating lease.  The future minimum lease obligation is $21 million for the remaining railcars as of December 31,   2015  .  Under a return-and-sale option, the lessor is guaranteed that the sale proceeds will equal at least a specified lessee obligation amount which declines with each five-year renewal.  As of December 31,   2015  , the maximum potential loss was approximately $19 million assuming the fair value of the equipment is zero at the end of the current five-year lease term.  However, management believes that the fair value would produce a sufficient sales price to avoid any loss.  AEP has other railcar lease arrangements that do not utilize this type of financing structure. 
    
    CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION INFORMATION 
    
  AEP s contractual cash obligations include amounts reported on the balance sheets and other obligations disclosed in the footnotes.  The following table summarizes AEP s contractual cash obligations as of December 31,   2015  : 

(a) 
    Represents principal only, excluding interest. 
              (b) 
    Interest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding as of December 31,   2015   and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early redemptions or debt issuances. 
              (c) 
    See  Long-term Debt  section of Note   14  .  Represents principal only, excluding interest. 
              (d) 
    See  Long-term Debt  section of Note   14  .  Represents principal only, excluding interest.  Variable rate debt had interest rates that ranged between 0.01% and 2.19% as of December 31,   2015  . 
               (f) 
    Represents contractual obligations to purchase coal, natural gas, uranium and other consumables as fuel for electric generation along with related transportation of the fuel. 
              (g) 
    Represents only capital assets for which there are signed contracts.  Actual payments are dependent upon and may vary significantly based upon the decision to build, regulatory approval schedules, timing and escalation of project costs. 
       
  AEP s $95 million liability related to uncertain tax positions is not included above because management cannot reasonably estimate the cash flows by period. 
    
    42 

    AEP s pension funding requirements are not included in the above table.  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP expects to make contributions to the pension plans totaling $94 million in   2016  .  Estimated contributions of $89 million in   2017   and $90 million in   2018   may vary significantly based on market returns, changes in actuarial assumptions and other factors.  Based upon the projected benefit obligation and fair value of assets available to pay pension benefits, the pension plans were 95.5% funded as of December 31,   2015  . 
    
  In addition to the amounts disclosed in the contractual cash obligations table above, additional commitments are made in the normal course of business.  These commitments include standby letters of credit, guarantees for the payment of obligation performance bonds and other commitments.  As of December 31,   2015  , the commitments outstanding under these agreements are summarized in the table below: 

(a) 
    Standby letters of credit (LOCs) are entered into with third parties.  These LOCs are issued in the ordinary course of business and cover items such as natural gas and electricity risk management contracts, construction contracts, insurance programs, security deposits and debt service reserves.  There is no collateral held in relation to any guarantees in excess of the ownership percentages.  In the event any LOC is drawn, there is no recourse to third parties.  See  Letters of Credit  section of Note   6  . 
              (b) 
    See  Guarantees of Third-Party Obligations  section of Note   6  . 
              (c) 
    Performance guarantees and indemnifications issued for energy trading and various sale agreements. 
       
  SIGNIFICANT TAX LEGISLATION 
    
  The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 provided for the extension of several business and energy industry tax deductions and credits, including the one-year extension of the 50% bonus depreciation to 2013.  The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 also included a one-year extension of the 50% bonus depreciation and provided for the extension of research and development, employment and several energy tax credits for 2014.   
    
  The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH) included an extension of the 50% bonus depreciation for three years through 2017, phasing down to 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019.  PATH also provided for the extension of research and development, employment and several energy tax credits for 2015.  PATH also includes provisions to extend the wind energy production tax credit through 2016 with a three-year phase-out (2017-2019), and to extend the 30% temporary solar investment tax credit for three years through 2019 with a two-year phase-out (2020-2021).  PATH also provided for a permanent extension of the Research and Development tax credit. 
    
  These enacted provisions had no material impact on net income or financial condition but did have a favorable impact on cash flows in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and are expected to have a favorable impact on future cash flows. 
    
    CYBER SECURITY 
    
  Cyber security presents a growing risk for electric utility systems because a cyber-attack could affect critical energy infrastructure.  Breaches to the cyber security of the grid or to the AEP System are potentially disruptive to people, property and commerce and create risk for business, investors and customers.  In February 2013, President Obama signed an executive order that addresses how government agencies will operate and support their functions in cyber security as well as redefines how the government interfaces with critical infrastructure, such as the electric grid.  The  
    43 

    AEP System already operates under regulatory cyber security standards to protect critical infrastructure.  The cyber security framework that was being developed through this executive order was reviewed by FERC and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  In 2014, the DOE published an Energy Sector Cyber Security Framework Implementation Guide for utilities to use in adopting and implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework.  AEP continues to be actively engaged in the framework adoption process. 
    
  The electric utility industry is one of the few critical infrastructure functions with mandatory cyber security requirements under the authority of FERC.  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC the authority to oversee reliability of the bulk power system, including the authority to implement mandatory cyber security reliability standards.  The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), which FERC certified as the nation s Electric Reliability Organization, developed mandatory critical infrastructure protection cyber security reliability standards.  AEP participated in the NERC GridEx II exercises in 2013 and GridEx III exercises in 2015.  These efforts, led by NERC, test and further develop the coordination, threat sharing and interaction between utilities and various government agencies relative to potential cyber and physical threats against the nation s electric grid. 
    
  Critical cyber assets, such as data centers, power plants, transmission operations centers and business networks are protected using multiple layers of cyber security and authentication.  The AEP System is constantly scanned for risks or threats.  Cyber hackers have been able to breach a number of very secure facilities, from federal agencies, banks and retailers to social media sites.  As these events become known and develop, AEP continually assesses its cyber security tools and processes to determine where to strengthen its defenses.  Management continually reviews its business continuity plan to develop an effective recovery effort that decreases response times, limits financial impacts and maintains customer confidence following any business interruption.  Management works closely with a broad range of departments, including Legal, Regulatory, Corporate Communications, Audit Services, Information Technology and Security, to ensure the corporate response to consequences of any breach or potential breach is appropriate both for internal and external audiences based on the specific circumstances surrounding the event. 
    
  Management continues to take steps to enhance the AEP System s capabilities for identifying risks or threats and has shared that knowledge of threats with utility peers, industry and federal agencies.  AEP operates a Cyber Security Intelligence and Response Center responsible for monitoring the AEP System for cyber threats as well as collaborating with internal and external threat sharing partners from both industry and government.  AEP is a member of an industry specific threat and information sharing community.  Funding for this community was initially provided by a grant from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act   U.S. Department of Energy Smart Grid Demonstration Program but is now fully funded by community membership. 
    
  AEP has partnered with a major defense contractor who has significant cyber security experience and technical capabilities developed through their work with the U.S. Department of Defense.  AEP works with a consortium of other utilities across the country, learning how best to share information about potential threats and collaborating with each other.  AEP continues to work with a nonaffiliated entity to conduct several seminars each year about recognizing and investigating cyber vulnerabilities.  Through these types of efforts, AEP is working to protect itself while helping its industry advance its cyber security capabilities. 
    
    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures, including amounts related to legal matters and contingencies.  Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:  

It requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and 
                
    Changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on net income or financial condition. 
       
    44 

    Management discusses the development and selection of critical accounting estimates as presented below with the Audit Committee of AEP s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee reviews the disclosures relating to them. 
    
  Management believes that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate.  However, actual results can differ significantly from those estimates. 
    
  The sections that follow present information about AEP s critical accounting estimates, as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate. 
    
  Regulatory Accounting 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required 
    
  The Registrants  financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that can result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. 
    
  The Registrants recognize regulatory assets (deferred expenses to be recovered in the future) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) for the economic effects of regulation.  Specifically, the timing of expense and income recognition is matched with regulated revenues.  Liabilities are also recorded for refunds, or probable refunds, to customers that have not been made. 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used 
    
  When incurred costs are probable of recovery through regulated rates, regulatory assets are recorded on the balance sheet.  Management reviews the probability of recovery at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur.  Similarly, regulatory liabilities are recorded when a determination is made that a refund is probable or when ordered by a commission.  Examples of new events that affect probability include changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of a regulatory commission order or passage of new legislation.  The assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to have an impact on the recovery of costs as well as the return of revenues, rate of return earned on invested capital and timing and amount of assets to be recovered through regulated rates.  If recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, that regulatory asset is written-off as a charge against earnings.  A write-off of regulatory assets or establishment of a regulatory liability may also reduce future cash flows since there will be no recovery through regulated rates. 
    
  Effect if Different Assumptions Used 
    
  A change in the above assumptions may result in a material impact on net income.  Refer to Note   5   for further detail related to regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities. 
    
  Revenue Recognition   Unbilled Revenues 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required 
    
  AEP records revenues when energy is delivered to the customer.  The determination of sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month.  At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue accrual is recorded.  This estimate is reversed in the following month and actual revenue is recorded based on meter readings.  PSO and SWEPCo do not record the fuel portion of unbilled revenue in accordance with the applicable state commission regulatory treatment in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. 
    
    45 

    The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP s Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $(63) million, $(29) million and $(9) million for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  The changes in unbilled electric revenues are primarily due to changes in weather and rates.  Accrued unbilled revenues for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $191 million and $254 million as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    
  The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP s Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment were $(30) million, $16 million and $(22) million for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  The changes in unbilled electric revenues are primarily due to changes in weather and rates.  Accrued unbilled revenues for the Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment were $151 million and $181 million as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    
  The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP s Generation   Marketing segment were $(3) million, $9 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  Accrued unbilled revenues for the Generation   Marketing segment were $47 million and $50 million as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used 
    
  For each Registrant, the monthly estimate for unbilled revenues is based upon a primary computation of net generation (generation plus purchases less sales) less the current month s billed KWh and estimated line losses, plus the prior month s unbilled KWh.  However, due to meter reading issues, meter drift and other anomalies, a secondary computation is made, based upon an allocation of billed KWh to the current month and previous month, on a billing cycle-by-cycle basis, and by dividing the current month aggregated result by the billed KWh.  The two methodologies are evaluated to confirm that they are not statistically different.   
    
  For AEP s Generation   Marketing segment, management calculates unbilled revenues by contract using the most recent historic daily activity adjusted for significant known changes in usage. 
    
  Effect if Different Assumptions Used 
    
  If the two methodologies used to estimate unbilled revenue are statistically different, a limiter adjustment is made to bring the primary computation within one standard deviation of the secondary computation. Additionally, significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period, weather, line losses or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the estimate of unbilled revenue.   
    
  Accounting for Derivative Instruments 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required 
    
  Management considers fair value techniques, valuation adjustments related to credit and liquidity and judgments related to the probability of forecasted transactions occurring within the specified time period to be critical accounting estimates.  These estimates are considered significant because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors. 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used 
    
  The Registrants measure the fair values of derivative instruments and hedge instruments accounted for using MTM accounting based primarily on exchange prices and broker quotes.  If a quoted market price is not available, the fair value is estimated based on the best market information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes, supply and demand market data and other assumptions.  Fair value estimates, based upon the best market information available, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment.  These uncertainties include projections of macroeconomic trends and future commodity prices, including supply and demand levels and future price volatility. 
    46 

    The Registrants reduce fair values by estimated valuation adjustments for items such as discounting, liquidity and credit quality.  Liquidity adjustments are calculated by utilizing bid/ask spreads to estimate the potential fair value impact of liquidating open positions over a reasonable period of time.  Credit adjustments on risk management contracts are calculated using estimated default probabilities and recovery rates relative to the counterparties or counterparties with similar credit profiles and contractual netting agreements. 
    
  With respect to hedge accounting, management assesses hedge effectiveness and evaluates a forecasted transaction s probability of occurrence within the specified time period as provided in the original hedge documentation. 
    
  Effect if Different Assumptions Used 
    
  There is inherent risk in valuation modeling given the complexity and volatility of energy markets.  Therefore, it is possible that results in future periods may be materially different as contracts settle. 
    
  The probability that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur by the end of the specified time period could change operating results by requiring amounts currently classified in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to be classified into operating income. 
    
  For additional information regarding derivatives, hedging and fair value measurements, see Notes   10   and   11  .  See  Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities  section of Note   1   for fair value calculation policy. 
    
  Long-Lived Assets 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required 
    
  In accordance with the requirements of  Property, Plant and Equipment  accounting guidance, the Registrants evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such assets may not be recoverable including planned abandonments and a probable disallowance for rate-making on a plant under construction or the assets meet the held-for-sale criteria.  The Registrants utilize a group composite method of depreciation to estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets.  The evaluations of long-lived, held and used assets may result from abandonments, significant decreases in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, as well as other economic or operations analyses.  If the carrying amount is not recoverable, the Registrants record an impairment to the extent that the fair value of the asset is less than its book value.  Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the undiscounted and discounted future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value, in some instances) associated with the asset.  For assets held for sale, an impairment is recognized if the expected net sales price is less than its book value.  For regulated assets, the earnings impact of an impairment charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset, if rate recovery is probable.  For nonregulated assets, any impairment charge is recorded against earnings. 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used 
    
  The fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available.  In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, the Registrants estimate fair value using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow projections or other market indicators of fair value such as bids received, comparable sales or independent appraisals.  Cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made.  Estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.  Also, when measuring fair value, management evaluates the characteristics of the asset or liability to determine if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the  
    47 

    measurement date.  Such characteristics include, for example, the condition and location of the asset or restrictions of the use of the asset.  The Registrants perform depreciation studies that include a review of any external factors that may affect the useful life to determine composite depreciation rates and related lives which are subject to periodic review by state regulatory commissions for cost-based regulated assets.  The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. 
    
  Effect if Different Assumptions Used 
    
  In connection with the evaluation of long-lived assets in accordance with the requirements of  Property, Plant and Equipment  accounting guidance, the fair value of the asset can vary if different estimates and assumptions would have been used in the applied valuation techniques.  The estimate for depreciation rates takes into account the history of interim capital replacements and the amount of salvage expected.  In cases of impairment, the best estimate of fair value was made using valuation methods based on the most current information at that time.  Fluctuations in realized sales proceeds versus the estimated fair value of the asset are generally due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, differences in subsequent market conditions, the level of bidder interest, timing and terms of the transactions and management s analysis of the benefits of the transaction. 
    
    Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
    
  AEP maintains a qualified, defined benefit pension plan (Qualified Plan), which covers substantially all nonunion and certain union employees, and unfunded, nonqualified supplemental plans (Nonqualified Plans) to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted under the provisions of the tax law for participants in the Qualified Plan (collectively the Pension Plans).  Additionally, AEP entered into individual employment contracts with certain current and retired executives that provide additional retirement benefits as a part of the Nonqualified Plans.  AEP also sponsors other postretirement benefit plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (Postretirement Plans).  The Pension Plans and Postretirement Plans are collectively referred to as the Plans. 
    
  For a discussion of investment strategy, investment limitations, target asset allocations and the classification of investments within the fair value hierarchy, see  Investments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities  and  Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities  sections of Note   1  .  See Note   8   for information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement and postretirement benefits. 
    
  The following table shows the net periodic cost (credit) of the Plans: 

The net periodic benefit cost is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including expected long-term rates of return on the Plans  assets.  In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for   2016  , management evaluated input from actuaries and investment consultants, including their reviews of asset class return expectations as well as long-term inflation assumptions.  Management also considered historical returns of the investment markets and changes in tax rates which affect a portion of the Postretirement Plans  assets.  Management anticipates that the investment managers employed for the Plans will invest the assets to generate future returns averaging   6%   for the Qualified Plan and   7%   for the Postretirement Plans. 
    
    48 

    The expected long-term rate of return on the Plans  assets is based on management s targeted asset allocation and expected investment returns for each investment category.  Assumptions for the Plans are summarized in the following table: 

Management regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the investments to the targeted allocation.  Management believes that   6%   for the Qualified Plan and   7%   for the Postretirement Plans are reasonable estimates of the long-term rate of return on the Plans  assets.  The Pension Plans  assets had an actual gain of 0.8% and 10.6% for the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  The Postretirement Plans  assets had an actual loss of 0.9% for the year ended December 31,   2015   and an actual gain of 7.2% for the year ended December 31,   2014  .  Management will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust the assumptions as necessary. 
    
  AEP bases the determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year volatility.  This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur.  Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets.  Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP had cumulative losses of approximately $23 million that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets.  These unrecognized net actuarial losses may result in increases in the future pension costs depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor in accordance with  Compensation   Retirement Benefits  accounting guidance. 
    
  The method used to determine the discount rate that AEP utilizes for determining future obligations is a duration-based method in which a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds is constructed with cash flows matching the benefit plan liability.  The composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio is used as the discount rate for the plan.  The discount rate as of December 31,   2015   under this method was   4.3%   for the Qualified Plan,   4.05%   for the Nonqualified Plans and   4.3%   for the Postretirement Plans.  Due to the effect of the unrecognized actuarial losses and based on an expected rate of return on the Pension Plans  assets of   6%  , discount rates of   4.3%   and   4.05%   and various other assumptions, management estimates that the pension costs for the Pension Plans will approximate $105 million, $78 million and $67 million in   2016  ,   2017   and   2018  , respectively.  Based on an expected rate of return on the Postretirement Plans  assets of   7%  , a discount rate of   4.3%   and various other assumptions, management estimates Postretirement Plan credits will approximate $74 million, $77 million and $79 million in   2016  ,   2017   and   2018  , respectively.  Future actual costs will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the Plans.  The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results.  The effects of a 50 basis point change to selective actuarial assumptions are included in the  Effect if Different Assumptions Used  section below. 
    
    49 

    The value of AEP s Pension Plans  assets decreased to   $4.8 billion   as of December 31,   2015   from $5 billion as of December 31,   2014   primarily due to benefit payments in excess of investment returns and company contributions from AEP System companies.  During   2015  , the Qualified Plan paid $325 million and the Nonqualified Plans paid $5 million in benefits to plan participants.  The value of AEP s Postretirement Plans  assets decreased to   $1.6 billion   as of December 31,   2015   from $1.7 billion as of December 31,   2014   primarily due to benefit payments and investment losses  in excess of contributions from AEP System companies and the participants.  The Postretirement Plans paid   $129 million   in benefits to plan participants during   2015  . 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required 
    
  AEP sponsors pension and other retirement and postretirement benefit plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements.  These benefits are accounted for under  Compensation  and  Plan Accounting  accounting guidance.  The measurement of pension and postretirement benefit obligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions. 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used 
    
  The critical assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: 

Discount rate 
                
    Compensation increase rate 
                
    Cash balance crediting rate 
                
    Health care cost trend rate 
                
    Expected return on plan assets 
       
  Other assumptions, such as retirement, mortality and turnover, are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience. 
    
  Effect if Different Assumptions Used 
    
  The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, longer or shorter life spans of participants or higher or lower lump sum versus annuity payout elections by plan participants.  These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recorded.  If a 50 basis point change were to occur for the following assumptions, the approximate effect on the financial statements would be as follows: 

NA 
    Not applicable.

      ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During 2015 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2014-08  Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant and Equipment  changing the presentation of discontinued operations on the statements of income and other requirements for reporting discontinued operations.  Under the new standard, a disposal of a component or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results when the component meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale or is disposed.  The amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about discontinued operations and disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations.  Management adopted ASU 2014-08 effective January 1, 2015.  
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2015-03  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheets.  Under the new standard, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability will be presented on the balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with discounts.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted.  Management adopted ASU 2015-03 in October 2015 and applied the new standard retrospectively for all periods presented.  Prior to adoption, AEP included debt issuance costs in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets. 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2015-13  Application of the Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Scope Exception to Certain Electricity Contracts within Nodal Energy Markets  clarifying whether a contract for the purchase or sale of electricity on a forward basis should be eligible to meet the physical delivery criterion of the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception when either the delivery location is within a nodal energy market or the contract necessitates transmission through a nodal energy market and one of the contracting parties incurs charges (or credits) for the transmission of electricity based in part on locational marginal pricing differences payable to (or receivable from) an independent system operator.  Under the new standard, the use of locational marginal pricing by an independent system operator does not cause a contract to fail to meet the physical delivery criterion of the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception.  As a result, an entity may elect to designate that contract as a normal purchase or normal sale.  The new accounting guidance is effective upon issuance and applied prospectively.  Management has analyzed the impact of this new standard and determined that it had no impact on the accounting of the Registrants  contracts.  Additionally, adoption had no impact on net income.  Management adopted ASU 2015-13 upon its issuance date. 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2015-17  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes on the balance sheets.  Under the new standard, deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent on the balance sheets.  The new accounting guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  Management adopted ASU 2015-17 upon its issuance date and applied the new standard prospectively. 
    
  Pronouncements Effective in the Future 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  clarifying the method used to determine the timing and requirements for revenue recognition on the statements of income.  Under the new standard, an entity must identify the performance obligations in a contract, determine the transaction price and allocate the price to specific performance obligations to recognize the revenue when the obligation is completed.  The amendments in this update also require disclosure of sufficient information to allow users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contracts.  The FASB deferred implementation of ASU 2014-09 under the terms in ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.   The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption on revenue or net income.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018. 
    
    51 

      The FASB issued ASU 2015-01  Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items  eliminating the concept of extraordinary items for presentation on the face of the income statement.  Under the new standard, a material event or transaction that is unusual in nature, infrequent or both shall be reported as a separate component of income from continuing operations.  Alternatively, it may be disclosed in the notes to financial statements.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  As applicable, this standard may change the presentation of amounts in the income statements.  Management adopted ASU 2015-01 effective January 1, 2016. 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2015-05  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  providing guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted.  Management adopted ASU 2015-05 prospectively, effective January 1, 2016, with no impact on results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2015-11  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  to simplify the guidance on the subsequent measurement of inventory, excluding inventory measured using last-in, first out or the retail inventory method.  Under the new standard, inventory should be at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  Management does not expect the new standard to impact its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2015-11 prospectively, effective January 1, 2017. 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2016-01  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  enhancing the reporting model for financial instruments.  Under the new standard, equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  The new standard also amends disclosure requirements and requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  The amendments also clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption on net income.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018. 
    
  Future Accounting Changes 
    
  The FASB s standard-setting process is ongoing and until new standards have been finalized and issued, management cannot determine the impact on the reporting of operations and financial position that may result from any such future changes.  The FASB is currently working on several projects including financial instruments, leases, insurance, hedge accounting, consolidation policy and pension and postretirement benefits.  The ultimate pronouncements resulting from these and future projects could have an impact on future net income and financial position.

      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Market Risks 
    
  The Vertically Integrated Utilities segment is exposed to certain market risks as a major power producer and through  transactions in power, coal, natural gas and marketing contracts.  These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk.  In addition, this segment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk from occasionally procuring various services and materials used in its energy business from foreign suppliers.  These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates. 
    
  The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment was exposed to FTR price risk as it related to RTO congestion during the June 2012   May 2015 Ohio ESP period.  Additional risks include energy procurement risk and interest rate risk. 
    
  The Generation   Marketing segment conducts marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO.  This segment is exposed to certain market risks as a marketer of wholesale and retail electricity.  These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk.  These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates.  In addition, the Generation   Marketing segment is also exposed to certain market risks as a major power producer and through transactions in wholesale electricity and natural gas and marketing contracts. 
    
  Management employs risk management contracts including physical forward purchase-and-sale contracts and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts.  Management engages in risk management of power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business.  As a result, AEP is subject to price risk.  The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.  AEPSC s market risk oversight staff independently monitors risk policies, procedures and risk levels and provides members of the Commercial Operations Risk Committee (Regulated Risk Committee) and the Energy Supply Risk Committee (Competitive Risk Committee) various reports regarding compliance with policies, limits and procedures.  The Regulated Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President of Generation, Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations and Chief Risk Officer.  The Competitive Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Risk Officer in addition to Energy Supply s President and Vice President.  When commercial activities exceed predetermined limits, positions are modified to reduce the risk to be within the limits unless specifically approved by the respective committee.

      The following table summarizes the reasons for changes in total MTM value as compared to December 31,   2014  : 

(a) 
    Reflects fair value on primarily long-term structured contracts which are typically with customers that seek fixed pricing to limit their risk against fluctuating energy prices.  The contract prices are valued against market curves associated with the delivery location and delivery term.  A significant portion of the total volumetric position has been economically hedged. 
              (b) 
    Market fluctuations are attributable to various factors such as supply/demand, weather, etc. 
              (c) 
    Relates to the net gains (losses) of those contracts that are not reflected on the statements of income.  These net gains (losses) are recorded as regulatory liabilities/assets. 
     See Note   10     Derivatives and Hedging and Note   11     Fair Value Measurements for additional information related to risk management contracts.  The following tables and discussion provide information on credit risk and market volatility risk. 
    
    54 

      Credit Risk 
    
  Credit risk is limited in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis.  Management uses Moody s Investors Service, Standard   Poor s and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial statements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis. 
    
  AEP has risk management contracts with numerous counterparties.  Since open risk management contracts are valued based on changes in market prices of the related commodities, exposures change daily.  As of December 31,   2015  ,  credit exposure net of collateral to sub investment grade counterparties was approximately 7.1%, expressed in terms of net MTM assets, net receivables and the net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM (representing economic risk even though there may not be risk of accounting loss).  As of December 31,   2015  , the following table approximates  AEP s counterparty credit quality and exposure based on netting across commodities, instruments and legal entities where applicable: 

In addition, AEP is exposed to credit risk related to participation in RTOs.  For each of the RTOs in which AEP participates, this risk is generally determined based on the proportionate share of member gross activity over a specified period of time. 
    
    55 

      Value at Risk (VaR) Associated with Risk Management Contracts 
    
  Management uses a risk measurement model, which calculates VaR, to measure AEP s commodity price risk in the risk management portfolio.  The VaR is based on the variance-covariance method using historical prices to estimate volatilities and correlations and assumes a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period.  Based on this VaR analysis, as of December 31,   2015  , a near term typical change in commodity prices is not expected to materially impact net income, cash flows or financial condition. 
    
  Management calculates the VaR for both a trading and non-trading portfolio.  The trading portfolio consists primarily of contracts related to energy trading and marketing activities.  The non-trading portfolio consists primarily of economic hedges of generation and retail supply activities.  The following tables show the end, high, average and low market risk as measured by VaR for the periods indicated: 
    
  VaR Model 
  Trading Portfolio 

VaR Model 
  Non-Trading Portfolio 

Management back-tests VaR results against performance due to actual price movements.  Based on the assumed 95% confidence interval, the performance due to actual price movements would be expected to exceed the VaR at least once every 20 trading days. 
    
  As the VaR calculation captures recent price movements, management also performs regular stress testing of the trading portfolio to understand AEP s exposure to extreme price movements.  A historical-based method is employed whereby the current trading portfolio is subjected to actual, observed price movements from the last several years in order to ascertain which historical price movements translated into the largest potential MTM loss.  Management then researches the underlying positions, price movements and market events that created the most significant exposure and reports the findings to the Risk Executive Committee, Regulated Risk Committee, or Competitive Risk Committee as appropriate. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Management utilizes an Earnings at Risk (EaR) model to measure interest rate market risk exposure.  EaR statistically quantifies the extent to which interest expense could vary over the next twelve months and gives a probabilistic estimate of different levels of interest expense.  The resulting EaR is interpreted as the dollar amount by which actual interest expense for the next twelve months could exceed expected interest expense with a one-in-twenty chance of occurrence.  The primary drivers of EaR are from the existing floating rate debt (including short-term debt) as well as long-term debt issuances in the next twelve months.  As calculated on debt outstanding as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , the estimated EaR on AEP s debt portfolio for the following twelve months was $25 million and $33 million, respectively.

  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of  
  American Electric Power Company, Inc.: 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and subsidiary companies (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of  
  American Electric Power Company, Inc.: 
    
  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and subsidiary companies (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework     (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
    
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
    
  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
    
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

      APPALACHIAN POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
    COMPANY OVERVIEW 
    
  As a public utility, APCo engages in the generation and purchase of electric power, and the subsequent sale, transmission and distribution of that power to 957,000 retail customers in its service territory in southwestern Virginia and southern West Virginia.  APCo consolidates Cedar Coal Company, Central Appalachian Coal Company, Southern Appalachian Coal Company and Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  APCo sells power at wholesale to municipalities.  APCo shares off-system sales margins with its customers. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2014, the Interconnection Agreement and the AEP System Interim Allowance Agreement were terminated.  Also effective January 1, 2014, the FERC approved a PCA among APCo, I M and KPCo with AEPSC as the agent to coordinate the participants  respective power supply resources.  Effective May 2015, the PCA was revised and approved by the FERC to include WPCo.  Under the PCA, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo are individually responsible for planning their respective capacity obligations.  Further, the Restated and Amended PCA allows, but does not obligate, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo to participate collectively under a common fixed resource requirement capacity plan in PJM and to participate in specified collective off-system sales and purchase activities. 
    
  Also effective January 1, 2014, the FERC approved a Bridge Agreement among AGR, APCo, I M, KPCo and OPCo with AEPSC as the agent.  The Bridge Agreement is an interim arrangement to: (a) address the treatment of purchases and sales made by AEPSC on behalf of member companies that extend beyond termination of the Interconnection Agreement and (b) address how member companies would fulfill their existing obligations under the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement through the 2014/2015 PJM planning year.  Under the Bridge Agreement, AGR is committed to meet capacity obligations of member companies. 
    
  AEPSC conducts power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other risk management activities on behalf of APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo.  Effective January 1, 2014, and revised in May 2015, power and natural gas risk management activities are allocated based on the member companies  respective equity positions.  Risk management activities primarily include power and natural gas physical transactions, financially-settled swaps and exchange-traded futures.  AEPSC settles the majority of the physical forward contracts by entering into offsetting contracts.  APCo shared in the revenues and expenses associated with these risk management activities with the member companies. 
    
  Under the SIA, AEPSC allocates physical and financial revenues and expenses from transactions with neighboring utilities, power marketers and other power and natural gas risk management activities based upon the location of such activity, with margins resulting from trading and marketing activities originating in PJM and MISO generally accruing to the benefit of APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo and trading and marketing activities originating in SPP generally accruing to the benefit of PSO and SWEPCo.  Margins resulting from other transactions are allocated among APCo, I M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo based upon the common shareholder s equity of these companies. 
  To minimize the credit requirements and operating constraints when operating within PJM, participating AEP companies, including APCo, agreed to a netting of certain payment obligations incurred by the participating AEP companies against certain balances due to such AEP companies and to hold PJM harmless from actions that any one or more AEP companies may take with respect to PJM. 
    
  APCo is jointly and severally liable for activity conducted by AEPSC on behalf of AEP companies related to power purchase and sale activity.

      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  KWh Sales/Degree Days 

Heating degree days and cooling degree days are metrics commonly used in the utility industry as a measure of the impact of weather on revenues. 

(a) 
    Heating degree days are calculated on a 55 degree temperature base. 
              (b) 
    Normal Heating/Cooling represents the thirty-year average of degree days. 
              (c) 
    Cooling degree days are calculated on a 65 degree temperature base.

      2015   Compared to   2014    
    
  Reconciliation of Year Ended December 31,   2014   to Year Ended December 31,   2015    
  Net Income 
  (in millions) 

The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $132 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $137 million increase primarily due to increases in rates in West Virginia, as well as an adjustment due to the amended Virginia law impacting biennial reviews.  Of these increases, $4 million relate to riders/trackers which have corresponding increases in other expense items below. 
                
    An $11 million decrease in generation related PJM expenses due to the polar vortex in 2014 net of recovery or offsets. 
                
    A $9 million increase due to a prior period true-up of previously unrecovered wind PPA costs relating to certain wind farms in Virginia.  The true-up is caused by a new commission approved recovery method. 
                
    A $7 million decrease in fuel expense from wholesale customers due to the timing of fuel recovery in 2014. 
                
    A $6 million decrease in consumables and allowances expenses. 
     This overall increase was partially offset by: 
             
    A $33 million decrease in weather-normalized margins primarily due to lower usage. 
                
    A $25 million decrease in weather-related usage primarily due to an 18% decrease in heating degree days. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   decreased by $18 million primarily due to lower Network Integration Transmission Service revenues. 
       
    69 

      Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses decreased $18 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $16 million decrease in employee-related expenses. 
                
    A $10 million decrease in plant maintenance expenses primarily at Amos Plant. 
      These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $15 million increase in distribution expenses due to an increase in vegetation management and storm amortization.  This increase in expense is offset within Retail Margins above. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses decreased $12 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $14 million decrease due to prior year amortization of Virginia environmental deferrals. This decrease in expense is offset within Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $2 million decrease due to prior year amortization of West Virginia ENEC deferrals. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $5 million increase due to higher depreciable base. 
                
    Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction   increased $7 million primarily due to increased transmission projects.  
                
    Interest Expense   decreased $17 million primarily due to lower interest rates on long-term debt. 
                
    Income Tax Expense   increased $39 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income, partially offset by the recording of federal and state income tax adjustments and other book/tax differences which are accounted for on a flow-through basis.

      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of 
  Appalachian Power Company: 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Appalachian Power Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in common shareholder s equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Appalachian Power Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

      INDIANA MICHIGAN POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
    COMPANY OVERVIEW 
    
  As a public utility, I M engages in the generation and purchase of electric power, and the subsequent sale, transmission and distribution of that power to 588,000 retail customers in its service territory in northern and eastern Indiana and southwestern Michigan.

I M sells power at wholesale to municipalities and electric cooperatives.  I M s River Transportation Division provides barging services to affiliates and nonaffiliated companies.  The revenues from barging represent the majority of other revenues.  I M shares off-system sales margins with its customers. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2014, the Interconnection Agreement and the AEP System Interim Allowance Agreement were terminated.  Effective January 1, 2014, the FERC approved a PCA among APCo, I M and KPCo with AEPSC as the agent to coordinate the participants  respective power supply resources.  Effective May 2015, the PCA was revised and approved by the FERC to include WPCo.  Under the PCA, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo are individually responsible for planning their respective capacity obligations.  Further, the Restated and Amended PCA allows, but does not obligate, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo to participate collectively under a common fixed resource requirement capacity plan in PJM and to participate in specified collective off-system sales and purchase activities. 
    
  Also effective January 1, 2014, the FERC approved a Bridge Agreement among AGR, APCo, I M, KPCo and OPCo with AEPSC as the agent.  The Bridge Agreement is an interim arrangement to: (a) address the treatment of purchases and sales made by AEPSC on behalf of member companies that extend beyond termination of the Interconnection Agreement and (b) address how member companies would fulfill their existing obligations under the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement through the 2014/2015 PJM planning year.  Under the Bridge Agreement, AGR is committed to meet capacity obligations of member companies. 
    
  AEPSC conducts power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other risk management activities on behalf of APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo.  Effective January 1, 2014, and revised in May 2015, power and natural gas risk management activities are allocated based on the member companies  respective equity positions.  Risk management activities primarily include power and natural gas physical transactions, financially-settled swaps and exchange-traded futures.  AEPSC settles the majority of the physical forward contracts by entering into offsetting contracts.  I M shared in the revenues and expenses associated with these risk management activities with the member companies. 
    
  Under a unit power agreement, I M purchases AEGCo s 50% share of the 2,620 MW Rockport Plant capacity unless it is sold to other utilities.  Another unit power agreement between AEGCo and KPCo provides for the sale of 390 MW of AEGCo s Rockport Plant capacity to KPCo through 2022.  Under these agreements, I M purchases 910 MW of AEGCo s 50% share of Rockport Plant capacity. 
    
  Under the SIA, AEPSC allocates physical and financial revenues and expenses from transactions with neighboring utilities, power marketers and other power and natural gas risk management activities based upon the location of such activity, with margins resulting from trading and marketing activities originating in PJM and MISO generally accruing to the benefit of APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo and trading and marketing activities originating in SPP generally accruing to the benefit of PSO and SWEPCo.  Margins resulting from other transactions are allocated among APCo, I M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo based upon the common shareholder s equity of these companies. 
    
  To minimize the credit requirements and operating constraints when operating within PJM, participating AEP companies, including I M, agreed to a netting of certain payment obligations incurred by the participating AEP companies against certain balances due to such AEP companies and to hold PJM harmless from actions that any one or more AEP companies may take with respect to PJM. 
    
  I M is jointly and severally liable for activity conducted by AEPSC on behalf of AEP companies related to power purchase and sale activity.

  Net Income 
  (in millions) 

The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $85 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $51 million increase from successful rate proceedings in the Indiana service territory.  The increase in retail margins relating to riders/trackers has corresponding increases in other items below. 
                
    A $38 million increase in FERC municipal and cooperative revenues due to the annual true-up adjustment of formula rates to actual costs and formula rate changes.   
                
    A $13 million decrease in PJM charges not currently recovered in rate recovery riders/trackers. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $15 million decrease in weather-normalized usage for the residential and industrial classes. 
                
    A $12 million decrease in weather-related usage primarily due to a 19% decrease in heating degree days, partially offset by a 12% increase in cooling degree days. 
                
    Margins from Off-system Sales   decreased $60 million due to lower market prices and decreased sales volumes. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   decreased $3 million primarily due to lower Network Integration Transmission Service revenues. 
                
    Other Revenues   decreased $6 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    An $11 million decrease in barging deliveries to the Rockport Plant by River Transportation Division (RTD).  The decrease in RTD revenue was offset by a corresponding decrease in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for barging below. 
     This decrease was partially offset by: 
     
    82 

      Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses decreased $49 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $21 million decrease in steam generation expenses primarily due to the retirement of Tanners Creek Plant in May 2015. 
                
    A $14 million decrease in environmental liabilities. 
                
    An $11 million decrease in RTD expenses for barging activities.  The decrease in RTD expenses was offset by a corresponding decrease in Other Revenues from barging activities above. 
                
    An $11 million decrease in general and administrative expenses. 
                
    An $8 million decrease in distribution expenses primarily due to lower storm restoration and forestry expense. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $7 million increase in nuclear expenses primarily related to Cook Plant, Unit 1 diesel generator repairs, partially offset by the recovery of a Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited insurance claim. 
                
    A $4 million increase in transmission expenses primarily due to increased PJM expenses.   
                
    Interest Expense   decreased $3 million primarily due to a lower interest rate on remarketed Pollution Control Bonds. 
                
    Income Tax Expense   increased $17 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income, partially offset by the recording of federal and state income tax adjustments.

      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of 
  Indiana Michigan Power Company: 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Indiana Michigan Power Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in common shareholder s equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Indiana Michigan Power Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

      MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
    
  The management of Indiana Michigan Power Company and subsidiaries (I M) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  I M s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  Management assessed the effectiveness of I M s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2015  .  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013) in Internal Control   Integrated Framework.  Based on management s assessment, I M s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,   2015  . 
    
  This annual report does not include an attestation report of I M s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit I M to provide only management s report in this annual report.

      OHIO POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
    COMPANY OVERVIEW 
    
  As a public utility, OPCo engages in the transmission and distribution of power to 1,468,000 retail customers in the northwestern, central, eastern and southern sections of Ohio.  OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve its remaining generation service customers.  In accordance with the PUCO s corporate separation order, OPCo remains responsible to provide power and capacity to OPCo customers who have not switched electric providers.  Effective January 1, 2014, OPCo purchased power from both affiliated and nonaffiliated entities, subject to auction requirements and PUCO approval, to meet the energy and capacity needs of customers.  OPCo consolidates Ohio Phase-in Recovery Funding LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2014, the Interconnection Agreement and the AEP System Interim Allowance Agreement were terminated.  Also effective January 1, 2014, the FERC approved a Bridge Agreement among AGR, APCo, I M, KPCo and OPCo with AEPSC as the agent.  The Bridge Agreement is an interim arrangement to: (a) address the treatment of purchases and sales made by AEPSC on behalf of member companies that extend beyond termination of the Interconnection Agreement and (b) address how member companies would fulfill their existing obligations under the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement through the 2014/2015 PJM planning year.  Under the Bridge Agreement, AGR is committed to meet capacity obligations of member companies. 
    
  In 2007, OPCo and AEGCo entered into a 10-year unit power agreement for the entire output from the Lawrenceburg Plant with an option for an additional 2-year period.  OPCo paid AEGCo for the capacity, depreciation, fuel, operation, maintenance and tax expenses.  These payments were due regardless of whether the plant operated.  Effective January 1, 2014, OPCo assigned the unit power agreement to AGR, which includes AGR s option to extend for an additional 2 years. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2014, AEPSC conducts only gasoline, diesel fuel, energy procurement and risk management activities on OPCo s behalf.  With the transfer of OPCo s generation assets to AGR, OPCo no longer participates in other risk management activities.   
    
  To minimize the credit requirements and operating constraints when operating within PJM, participating AEP companies, including OPCo, agreed to a netting of certain payment obligations incurred by the participating AEP companies against certain balances due to such AEP companies and to hold PJM harmless from actions that any one or more AEP companies may take with respect to PJM. 
    
  OPCo is jointly and severally liable for activity conducted by AEPSC on behalf of AEP companies related to power purchase and sale activity.

  Net Income 
  (in millions) 

The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of purchased electricity and amortization of generation deferrals were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $181 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $131 million increase in transmission and PJM revenues primarily due to the energy supplied as result of the Ohio auction and a regulatory change which resulted in revenues collected through a non-bypassable transmission rider, partially offset by a corresponding decrease in Transmission Revenues below. 
                
    A $50 million increase in rider revenues associated with the Distribution Investment Rider (DIR), the   gridSMART        Rider, the Enhanced Service Reliability (ESR) Rider and the Retail Stability Rider (RSR).  These increases in rider revenues are partially offset by net increase in other expense items below. 
      These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $25 million decrease in revenues associated with the recovery of 2012 storm costs under the Storm Damage Recovery Rider which ended in April 2015.  This decrease in Retail Margins is offset by a decrease in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses below. 
                
    A $17 million decrease in rider revenues associated with the Energy Efficiency/Peak Demand Reduction Cost Recovery Rider (EE/PDR).  This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses below. 
                
    An $11 million decrease in revenues associated with the Universal Service Fund (USF) surcharge.  This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses below. 
                
    Margins from Off-system Sales   decreased $27 million primarily due to losses from a power contract with OVEC. 
       
    95 

Transmission Revenues   decreased $107 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    An $82 million decrease in Network Integrated Transmission Service (NITS) revenue primarily due to OPCo assuming the responsibility for items determined to be cost-based transmission-related charges that were the responsibility of the CRES providers prior to June 2015, partially offset by a corresponding increase in Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $12 million decrease in revenues related to a lower annual transmission formula rate true-up. 
                 
    Other Revenues   increased $11 million primarily due to increased pole attachment revenue. 
       
   Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $6 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $31 million increase in recoverable PJM expenses. 
                
    A $17 million increase in recoverable   gridSMART        expenses.  This increase was offset by a corresponding increase in Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $12 million increase related to a regulatory settlement. 
                
    A $6 million increase due to PUCO ordered contributions to the Ohio Growth Fund. 
                
    A $3 million increase due to write-offs of material no longer in use. 
                
    A $3 million increase in recoverable distribution vegetation management expenses related to the ESR Rider.  This increase was offset by a corresponding increase in Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $2 million increase in joint use pole rental expenses. 
                
    A $2 million increase for expenses related to an AEP safety awareness media campaign. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $26 million decrease due to the completion of the amortization of 2012 deferred storm expenses in April 2015.  This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in Retail Margins above.  
                
    A $17 million decrease in EE/PDR costs and associated deferrals.  This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $13 million decrease related to charitable donations and community development contributions. 
                
    An $11 million decrease in remitted USF surcharge payments to the Ohio Department of Development to fund an energy assistance program for qualified Ohio customers.  This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in Retail Margins above. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses increased $4 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $12 million increase in depreciation expense primarily due to an increase in depreciable base of transmission and distribution assets. 
                
    An $8 million increase in amortization expenses for the collection of carrying costs on deferred capacity charges beginning June 2015.  This increase was offset by a corresponding increase in Retail Margins above. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $9 million decrease in recoverable DIR depreciation expense.  This decrease was offset by a decrease in Retail Margins above. 
                
    An $8 million decrease in recoverable   gridSMART        depreciation expenses.  This decrease was offset by a decrease in Retail Margins above. 
                
    Taxes Other Than Income Taxes   increased $20 million primarily due to an increase in property taxes due to additional investment in transmission and distribution assets and higher tax rates. 
                
    Carrying Costs Income   decreased $15 million primarily due to   the collection of carrying costs on deferred capacity charges beginning June 2015. 
                
    Income Tax Expense   decreased $6 million primarily due to the recording of state income tax adjustments, partially offset by an increase in pretax book income.

  As a public utility, PSO engages in the generation and purchase of electric power, and the subsequent sale, transmission and distribution of that power to approximately 545,000 retail customers in its service territory in eastern and southwestern Oklahoma.  PSO sells electric power at wholesale to other utilities, municipalities and electric cooperatives.  PSO shares off-system sales margins with its customers. 
    
  In March 2014, SPP changed from an energy imbalance service market to a fully integrated power market.  Previously, PSO and SWEPCo satisfied their load requirements with their own generation resources or through the Operating Agreement.  In the new integrated power market, PSO and SWEPCo operate as standalone entities and offer their respective generation into the SPP power market.  SPP then economically dispatches the resources. 
    
  AEPSC conducts power, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other risk management activities on PSO s behalf.  PSO shares in the revenues and expenses associated with these risk management activities, as described in the preceding paragraph, with SWEPCo.  Power and natural gas risk management activities are allocated based on the Operating Agreement.  Risk management activities primarily include power and natural gas and physical transactions, financially-settled swaps and exchange-traded futures.  AEPSC settles the majority of the physical forward contracts by entering into offsetting contracts. 
    
  Under the SIA, AEPSC allocates physical and financial revenues and expenses from transactions with neighboring utilities, power marketers and other power and natural gas risk management activities based upon the location of such activity, with margins resulting from trading and marketing activities originating in PJM and MISO generally accruing to the benefit of APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo and trading and marketing activities originating in SPP generally accruing to the benefit of PSO and SWEPCo.  Margins resulting from other transactions are allocated among APCo, I M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo based upon the common shareholder s equity of these companies. 
    
  PSO is jointly and severally liable for activity conducted by AEPSC on the behalf of PSO and SWEPCo related to power purchase and sale activity.

(a) 
    Includes firm wholesale sales to municipals and cooperatives. 
       
  The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $20 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $25 million increase primarily due to revenue increases from rate riders. This increase in retail margins has corresponding increases to riders/trackers recognized in other expense items below. 
     This increase was partially offset by: 
             
    A $6 million decrease primarily due to lower weather-normalized retail sales. 
       
  Expenses and Other and changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $2 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $5 million increase in transmission expenses primarily due to increased SPP transmission services. 
                
    A $3 million increase in distribution expenses primarily due to the amortization of 2013 storm restoration expenses that began in the second quarter of 2015.                     
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $3 million decrease in generation plant maintenance expenses. 
                
    A $2 million decrease in general and administrative expenses.             
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses increased $17 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $9 million increase in amortization primarily related to an advanced metering rider implemented in November 2014.   
                
    A $7 million increase due to a higher depreciable base.  
                
    Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction   increased $6 million primarily due to increased environmental projects.  
                
    Interest Expense   increased $4 million primarily due to increased long-term debt outstanding.

      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of  
  Public Service Company of Oklahoma: 
    
  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Public Service Company of Oklahoma (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in common shareholder s equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Public Service Company of Oklahoma as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

      MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
    
  The management of Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  PSO s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  Management assessed the effectiveness of PSO s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2015  .  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013) in Internal Control   Integrated Framework.  Based on management s assessment, PSO s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,   2015  . 
    
  This annual report does not include an attestation report of PSO s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit PSO to provide only management s report in this annual report.

      SOUTHWESTERN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY CONSOLIDATED 
  MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
    COMPANY OVERVIEW 
    
  As a public utility, SWEPCo engages in the generation and purchase of electric power, and the subsequent sale, transmission and distribution of that power to approximately 531,000 retail customers in its service territory in northeastern and panhandle of Texas, northwestern Louisiana and western Arkansas.  SWEPCo consolidates its wholly-owned subsidiary, Southwest Arkansas Utilities Corporation.  SWEPCo also consolidates Sabine Mining Company, a variable interest entity.  SWEPCo sells electric power at wholesale to other utilities, municipalities and electric cooperatives.  SWEPCo shares off-system sales margins with its customers. 
    
  In March 2014, SPP changed from an energy imbalance service market to a fully integrated power market.  Previously, PSO and SWEPCo satisfied their load requirements with their own generation resources or through the Operating Agreement.  In the new integrated power market, PSO and SWEPCo operate as standalone entities and offer their respective generation into the SPP power market.  SPP then economically dispatches the resources.

  Earnings Attributable to SWEPCo Common Shareholder 
  (in millions) 

(a) 
    Includes firm wholesale sales to municipals and cooperatives. 
       
  The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased   $95 million   primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $56 million increase primarily due to revenue increases from rate riders in Louisiana and Texas. 
                
    A $21 million increase in municipal and cooperative revenues primarily due to annual formula rate adjustments. 
                
    An $18 million increase primarily due to higher fuel cost recovery. 
                
    A $14 million net increase in weather-related usage primarily due to a 20% increase in cooling degree days, partially offset by a decrease in heating degree days. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $15 million decrease primarily due to lower weather-normalized retail sales. 
                
    Margins from Off-system Sales   decreased   $13 million   primarily due to decreased sales volumes and lower 
     market prices. 
             
    Transmission Revenues   increased   $6 million   primarily due to higher SPP margins. 
       
    120 

      Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased   $28 million   primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $16 million increase in transmission expenses primarily due to increased SPP transmission services. 
                
    An $11 million increase in distribution expenses primarily due to increased vegetation management expenses. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses increased   $7 million   primarily due to a higher depreciable base. 
                
    Taxes Other Than Income Taxes   increased   $4 million   primarily due to higher property taxes. 
                
    Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction   increased   $15 million   primarily due to increased environmental and transmission projects. 
                
    Interest Expense   decreased   $6 million   primarily due to the following: 
                
    An $8 million increase in the debt component of AFUDC due to increased environmental and transmission projects. 
     This decrease was partially offset by: 
             
    A $2 million increase due to increased long-term debt outstanding. 
                
    Income Tax Expense   increased   $18 million   primarily due to an increase in pretax book income, partially offset by other   book/tax differences which are accounted for on a flow-through basis.

      1.    ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  ORGANIZATION 
    
  The Registrants engage in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power.  The Registrant Subsidiaries that conduct most of these activities are regulated by the FERC under the Federal Power Act and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and maintain accounts in accordance with the FERC and other regulatory guidelines.  Most of these companies are subject to further regulation with regard to rates and other matters by state regulatory commissions. 
    
  AEP provides competitive electric and gas supply for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Illinois and other deregulated electricity markets and also provides energy management solutions throughout the United States, including energy efficiency services through its independent retail electric supplier. 
    
  The Registrants also engage in wholesale electricity, natural gas and other commodity marketing and risk management activities in the United States and provide various energy-related services.  In addition, operations include barging operations and nonregulated wind farms.  I M provides barging services to both affiliated and nonaffiliated companies.  SWEPCo, through consolidated and nonconsolidated affiliates, conducts lignite mining operations to fuel certain of its generation facilities.   
    
  Corporate Separation (Applies to AEP, APCo, I M and OPCo) 
    
  On December 31, 2013, as approved by the FERC and the PUCO, OPCo transferred its generation assets and related generation liabilities at net book value to AGR.  In accordance with Ohio law, OPCo remains responsible to provide power and capacity to OPCo customers who have not switched electric providers.  Effective January 1, 2014, OPCo began purchasing power from both affiliated and nonaffiliated entities, subject to PUCO approval, to meet the energy and capacity needs of customers.  In 2013, in connection with corporate separation of OPCo s generation assets and liabilities, OPCo transferred its ownership of Cook Coal Terminal to AEGCo and sold the majority of its assets related to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Conesville Coal Preparation Company (CCPC).  On December 31, 2013, subsequent to the transfer of OPCo s generation assets and associated liabilities to AGR, AGR transferred at net book value its ownership (867 MW) in Amos Plant, Unit 3 to APCo and one-half of its interest (780 MW) in the Mitchell Plant to KPCo.   
    
  APCo s acquisition of the two-thirds ownership in Amos Plant, Unit 3 qualifies as an acquisition of a business under common control, which is typically accounted for as if the transfer had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, pursuant to accounting guidance for  Business Combinations.   However, management determined the retrospective application of this transfer to be quantitatively and qualitatively immaterial when taken as a whole in relation to APCo s financial statements.  As a result, APCo s financial statements were not retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer. 
    
  Other Impacts of Corporate Separation 
    
  The Interconnection Agreement was terminated effective January 1, 2014.  The AEP System Interim Allowance Agreement which provided for, among other things, the transfer of SO   2    emission allowances associated with transactions under the Interconnection agreement was also terminated. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2014, the FERC approved: 

A PCA among APCo, I M and KPCo with AEPSC as the agent to coordinate the participants  respective power supply resources.  Under the PCA, APCo, I M and KPCo are individually responsible for planning their respective capacity obligations and there are no capacity equalization charges/credits under the PCA on deficit/surplus companies.   Further, the PCA allows, but does not obligate, APCo, I M and KPCo to participate collectively under a common fixed resource requirement capacity plan in PJM and to participate in specified collective off-system sales and purchase activities. 
       131 

A Bridge Agreement among AGR, APCo, I M, KPCo and OPCo with AEPSC as agent.  The Bridge Agreement is an interim arrangement to: (a) address the treatment of purchases and sales made by AEPSC on behalf of member companies that extend beyond termination of the Interconnection Agreement and (b) address how member companies would fulfill their existing obligations under the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement through the 2014/2015 PJM planning year.  Under the Bridge Agreement, AGR is committed to use its capacity to help meet the PJM capacity obligations of member companies. 
                
    A Power Supply Agreement (PSA) between AGR and OPCo that provided for AGR to supply capacity for OPCo s switched (at   $188.88  /MW day) and non-switched retail load for the period January 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015 and to supply the energy needs of OPCo s non-switched retail load that was not acquired through auctions in 2014. 
       
  Disposition of AEP River Operations 
    
  In October 2015, AEP signed an agreement to sell its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated third party.  The sale closed in November 2015.  AEPRO s assets and liabilities have been recorded as Assets from Discontinued Operations and Liabilities from Discontinued Operations, respectively, on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2014.  The results of operations of AEPRO have been classified as Discontinued Operations on the statements of income for the current period and prior periods presented.  The transaction was accounted for in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant and Equipment.   Material disclosures within the notes to the financial statements exclude amounts related to Discontinued Operations for all periods presented as well as amounts related to Assets from Discontinued Operations and Liabilities from Discontinued Operations as of December 31, 2014.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
    
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Rates and Service Regulation 
    
  AEP s public utility subsidiaries  rates are regulated by the FERC and state regulatory commissions in the eleven state operating territories in which they operate.  The FERC also regulates the Registrants  affiliated transactions, including AEPSC intercompany service billings which are generally at cost, under the 2005 Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal Power Act.  The FERC also has jurisdiction over the issuances and acquisitions of securities of the public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company.  For non-power goods and services, the FERC requires a nonregulated affiliate to bill an affiliated public utility company at no more than market while a public utility must bill the higher of cost or market to a nonregulated affiliate.  The state regulatory commissions also regulate certain intercompany transactions under various orders and affiliate statutes.  Both the FERC and state regulatory commissions are permitted to review and audit the relevant books and records of companies within a public utility holding company system. 
    
  The FERC regulates wholesale power markets and wholesale power transactions.  The Registrants  wholesale power transactions are generally market-based.  Wholesale power transactions are cost-based regulated when a cost-based contract is negotiated and filed with the FERC or the FERC determines that the Registrants have  market power  in the region where the transaction occurs.  Wholesale power supply contracts have been entered into with various municipalities and cooperatives that are FERC-regulated, cost-based contracts.  These contracts are generally formula rate mechanisms, which are trued up to actual costs annually.   
    
  The state regulatory commissions regulate all of the retail distribution operations and rates of the Registrants  retail public utility subsidiaries on a cost basis.  The state regulatory commissions also regulate the retail generation/power supply operations and rates except in Ohio and the ERCOT region of Texas.  For generation in Ohio, customers who have not switched to a CRES provider for generation pay market-based auction rates.  In addition, all OPCo distribution customers pay for certain     deferred generation-related     costs through non-bypassable charges.  In the ERCOT region of Texas, the generation/supply business is under customer choice and market pricing is conducted by Texas Retail Electric Providers (REPs).  AEP has no active REPs in ERCOT.  AEP s nonregulated subsidiaries enter into short and long- 
    132 

    term wholesale transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in the ERCOT market.  In addition, these nonregulated subsidiaries control certain wind and coal-fired generation assets, the power from which is marketed and sold in ERCOT.   
    
  The FERC also regulates the Registrants  wholesale transmission operations and rates.  Retail transmission rates are based upon the FERC OATT rate when retail rates are unbundled in connection with restructuring.  OPCo s retail transmission rates in Ohio, APCo s retail transmission rates in Virginia, I M s retail transmission rates in Michigan and TCC s and TNC s retail transmission rates in Texas are unbundled.  OPCo s retail transmission rates in Ohio, APCo s retail transmission rates in Virginia and I M s retail transmission rates in Michigan are based on formula rates included in the PJM OATT that are cost-based.  Although TCC s and TNC s retail transmission rates in Texas are unbundled, retail transmission rates are regulated, on a cost basis, by the PUCT.  Bundled retail transmission rates are regulated, on a cost basis, by the state commissions.  Transmission rates for AEP s seven wholly-owned transmission subsidiaries within the AEP Transmission Holdco segment are based on formula rates included in the applicable RTO s OATT that are cost-based. 
    
  In West Virginia, APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-service basis.  
    
  In addition, the FERC regulates the SIA, the Operating Agreement, the Transmission Agreement and the Transmission Coordination Agreement, all of which allocate shared system costs and revenues among the utility subsidiaries that are parties to each agreement.  In accordance with management s 2012 filing with the FERC, the Interconnection Agreement was terminated effective January 1, 2014.  The AEP System Interim Allowance Agreement which provided for, among other things, the transfer of SO   2    emission allowances associated with transactions under the Interconnection Agreement was also terminated.  In December 2013, the FERC issued orders approving the creation of a PCA and a PSA, effective January 1, 2014.  The PCA is among APCo, I M and KPCo with AEPSC as the agent to coordinate the participants  respective power supply resources.  Effective May 2015, the PCA was revised and approved by the FERC to include WPCo.  Also effective January 1, 2014, the FERC approved the creation of a Bridge Agreement among AGR, APCo, I M, KPCo and OPCo with AEPSC as the agent.  Effective June 1, 2014, the FERC approved the cancellation of the System Transmission Integration Agreement. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  AEP s consolidated financial statements include its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs of which AEP is the primary beneficiary.  The consolidated financial statements for APCo include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding (a substantially-controlled VIE).  The consolidated financial statements for I M include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and DCC Fuel (substantially-controlled VIEs).  The consolidated financial statements for OPCo include the Registrant Subsidiary and Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding (a substantially-controlled VIE).  The consolidated financial statements for SWEPCo include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiary and Sabine (a substantially-controlled VIE).  Intercompany items are eliminated in consolidation.  The equity method of accounting is used for equity investments where the Registrants exercise significant influence but do not hold a controlling financial interest.  Such investments are initially recorded at cost in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets.  The proportionate share of the investee s equity earnings is included in Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on the statements of income.  Equity method investments are required to be tested for impairment when it is determined there may be an other-than-temporary loss in value.  AEP, I M, PSO and SWEPCo have ownership interests in generating units that are jointly-owned.  The proportionate share of the operating costs associated with such facilities is included in the income statements and the assets and liabilities are reflected in the balance sheets.  See Note   17     Variable Interest Entities and Note   18     Property, Plant and Equipment. 
    
    133 

    Accounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation 
    
  The Registrants  financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated.  In accordance with accounting guidance for  Regulated Operations,  regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and by matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  These estimates include, but are not limited to, inventory valuation, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment, unbilled electricity revenue, valuation of long-term energy contracts, the effects of regulation, long-lived asset recovery, storm costs, the effects of contingencies and certain assumptions made in accounting for pension and postretirement benefits.  The estimates and assumptions used are based upon management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements.  Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents include temporary cash investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
    
  Other Temporary Investments (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Other Temporary Investments include funds held by trustees primarily for the payment of securitization bonds and securities available for sale, including marketable securities that management intends to hold for less than one year and investments by its protected cell of EIS. 
    
  Management classifies investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity in accordance with the provisions of  Investments   Debt and Equity Securities  accounting guidance.  AEP does not have any investments classified as trading. 
    
  Available-for-sale securities reflected in Other Temporary Investments are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, reported in AOCI.  Held-to-maturity securities reflected in Other Temporary Investments are carried at amortized cost.  The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification or weighted average cost method. 
    
  In evaluating potential impairment of securities with unrealized losses, management considers, among other criteria, the current fair value compared to cost, the length of time the security s fair value has been below cost, intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value and current economic conditions.  See  Fair Value Measurements of Other Temporary Investments  in Note   11  . 
    
  Restricted Cash for Securitized Funding (Applies to APCo and OPCo) 
    
  Restricted Cash for Securitized Funding includes funds held by trustees primarily for the payment of securitization bonds. 
    
  Inventory 
    
  Fossil fuel inventories are generally carried at average cost with the exception of AGR and TNC which are carried at the lower of average cost or market.  Materials and supplies inventories are carried at average cost. 
    134 

    Accounts Receivable 
    
  Customer accounts receivable primarily include receivables from wholesale and retail energy customers, receivables from energy contract counterparties related to risk management activities and customer receivables primarily related to other revenue-generating activities. 
    
  Revenue is recognized from electric power sales when power is delivered to customers.  To the extent that deliveries have occurred but a bill has not been issued, the Registrants accrue and recognize, as Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the balance sheets, an estimate of the revenues for energy delivered since the last billing. 
    
  AEP Credit factors accounts receivable on a daily basis, excluding receivables from risk management activities, through purchase agreements with I M, KGPCo, KPCo, OPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and a portion of APCo.  Since APCo does not have regulatory authority to sell accounts receivable in its West Virginia regulatory jurisdiction, only a portion of APCo s accounts receivable are sold to AEP Credit.  AEP Credit has a receivables securitization agreement with bank conduits.  Under the securitization agreement, AEP Credit receives financing from bank conduits for the interest in the billed and unbilled receivables AEP Credit acquires from affiliated utility subsidiaries.  See  Sale of Receivables   AEP Credit  section of Note   14   for additional information. 
    
  Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts 
    
  Generally, AEP Credit records bad debt expense based upon a 12-month rolling average of bad debt write-offs in proportion to gross accounts receivable purchased from participating AEP subsidiaries.  For receivables related to APCo s West Virginia operations, the bad debt reserve is calculated based on a rolling two-year average write-off in proportion to gross accounts receivable.  For customer accounts receivables relating to risk management activities, accounts receivables are reviewed for bad debt reserves at a specific counterparty level basis.  For the wires business of TCC and TNC, bad debt reserves are calculated using the specific identification of receivable balances greater than 120 days delinquent, and for those balances less than 120 days where the collection is doubtful.  For miscellaneous accounts receivable, bad debt expense is recorded for all amounts outstanding 180 days or greater at 100%, unless specifically identified.  Miscellaneous accounts receivable items open less than 180 days may be reserved using specific identification for bad debt reserves. 
    
  Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries) 
    
  The Registrant Subsidiaries do not have any significant customers that comprise 10% or more of their operating revenues as of December 31,   2015  . 
    
  The Registrant Subsidiaries monitor credit levels and the financial condition of their customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk.  The regulatory commissions allow recovery in rates for a reasonable level of bad debt costs.  Management believes adequate provisions for credit loss have been made in the accompanying Registrant Subsidiary financial statements. 
    
  Emission Allowances 
    
  In regulated jurisdictions, the Registrants record emission allowances at cost, including the annual SO   2    and NO   x    emission allowance entitlements received at no cost from the Federal EPA.  For AEP s nonregulated business, management records allowances at the lower of cost or market.  Prior to corporate separation and the distribution of all emission allowances to AGR on December 31, 2013, OPCo recorded allowances at the lower of cost or market.  The Registrants follow the inventory model for these allowances.  Allowances expected to be consumed within one year are reported in Materials and Supplies on the balance sheets.  Allowances with expected consumption beyond one year are included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets.  The purchases and sales of allowances are reported in the Operating Activities section of the statements of cash flows.  These allowances are consumed in the production of energy and are recorded in Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation at an average cost on the statements of income.  The net margin on sales of emission allowances is included in Vertically  
    135 

    Integrated Utilities Revenue on AEP s statements of income and in Electric Generation, Transmission and Distribution Revenues for nonaffiliated transactions and in Sales to AEP Affiliates for affiliated transactions on Registrant Subsidiaries  statements of income because of its integral nature to the production process of energy and the Registrants  revenue optimization strategy for their operations.  The net margin on sales of emission allowances affects the determination of deferred fuel or deferred emission allowance costs and the amortization of regulatory assets for certain jurisdictions. 
    
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
    
  Regulated 
    
  Electric utility property, plant and equipment for rate-regulated operations are stated at original cost. Additions, major replacements and betterments are added to the plant accounts.  Under the group composite method of depreciation, continuous interim routine replacements of items such as boiler tubes, pumps, motors, etc. result in original cost retirements, less salvage, being charged to accumulated depreciation.  The group composite method of depreciation assumes that on average, asset components are retired at the end of their useful lives and thus there is no gain or loss.  The equipment in each primary electric plant account is identified as a separate group.  The depreciation rates that are established take into account the past history of interim capital replacements and the amount of removal cost incurred and salvage received.  These rates and the related lives are subject to periodic review.  Removal costs are charged to regulatory liabilities.  The costs of labor, materials and overhead incurred to operate and maintain plant and equipment are included in operating expenses. 
    
  Long-lived assets are required to be tested for impairment when it is determined that the carrying value of the assets may no longer be recoverable or when the assets meet the held-for-sale criteria under the accounting guidance for  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.   When it becomes probable that an asset in service or an asset under construction will be abandoned and regulatory cost recovery has been disallowed, the cost of that asset shall be removed from plant-in-service or CWIP and charged to expense. 
    
  The fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, as opposed to a forced or liquidation sale.  Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available.  In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow analysis and appraisals. 
    
  Nonregulated 
    
  Nonregulated operations generally follow the policies of rate-regulated operations listed above but with the following exceptions.  Property, plant and equipment of nonregulated operations are stated at original cost (or as adjusted for any applicable impairments) plus the original cost of property acquired or constructed since the acquisition, less disposals.  Normal and routine retirements from the plant accounts, net of salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation for most nonregulated operations under the group composite method of depreciation.  A gain or loss would be recorded if the retirement is not considered an interim routine replacement.  Removal costs are charged to expense. 
    
  Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalization 
    
  For regulated operations, AFUDC represents the estimated cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction projects that is capitalized and recovered through depreciation over the service life of regulated electric utility plant.  The Registrants record the equity component of AFUDC in Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction and the debt component of AFUDC as a reduction to Interest Expense.  For nonregulated operations, including certain generating assets, interest is capitalized during construction in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Capitalization of Interest.  
    
    136 

    Valuation of Nonderivative Financial Instruments 
    
  The book values of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Advances to/from Affiliates, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Short-term Debt approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.  The book value of the pre-April 1983 spent nuclear fuel disposal liability approximates the best estimate of its fair value. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The accounting guidance for  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).  Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2.  When quoted market prices are not available, pricing may be completed using comparable securities, dealer values, operating data and general market conditions to determine fair value.  Valuation models utilize various inputs such as commodity, interest rate and, to a lesser degree, volatility and credit that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, market corroborated inputs (i.e. inputs derived principally from, or correlated to, observable market data) and other observable inputs for the asset or liability.  The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of AEP s Board of Directors.  AEPSC s market risk oversight staff independently monitors risk policies, procedures and risk levels and provides members of the Commercial Operations Risk Committee (Regulated Risk Committee) and the Energy Supply Risk Committee (Competitive Risk Committee) various reports regarding compliance with policies, limits and procedures.  The Regulated Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President of Generation, Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations and Chief Risk Officer.  The Competitive Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer in addition to Energy Supply s President and Vice President. 
    
  For commercial activities, exchange traded derivatives, namely futures contracts, are generally fair valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.  Level 2 inputs primarily consist of OTC broker quotes in moderately active or less active markets, as well as exchange traded contracts where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in Level 1.  Management verifies price curves using these broker quotes and classifies these fair values within Level 2 when substantially all of the fair value can be corroborated.  Management typically obtains multiple broker quotes, which are nonbinding in nature but are based on recent trades in the marketplace.  When multiple broker quotes are obtained, the quoted bid and ask prices are averaged.  In certain circumstances, a broker quote may be discarded if it is a clear outlier.  Management uses a historical correlation analysis between the broker quoted location and the illiquid locations.  If the points are highly correlated, these locations are included within Level 2 as well.  Certain OTC and bilaterally executed derivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information.  Illiquid transactions, complex structured transactions, FTRs and counterparty credit risk may require nonmarket based inputs.  Some of these inputs may be internally developed or extrapolated and utilized to estimate fair value.  When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized as Level 3.  The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3 is the inability to substantiate energy price curves in the market.  A portion of the Level 3 instruments have been economically hedged which limits potential earnings volatility. 
    
  AEP utilizes its trustee s external pricing service to estimate the fair value of the underlying investments held in the benefit plan and nuclear trusts.  AEP s investment managers review and validate the prices utilized by the trustee to determine fair value.  AEP s management performs its own valuation testing to verify the fair values of the securities.  AEP receives audit reports of the trustee s operating controls and valuation processes.  The trustee uses multiple pricing vendors for the assets held in the trusts. 
    
    137 

    Assets in the benefits and nuclear trusts, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Other Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash for Securitized Funding are classified using the following methods.  Equities are classified as Level 1 holdings if they are actively traded on exchanges.  Items classified as Level 1 are investments in money market funds, fixed income and equity mutual funds and domestic equity securities.  They are valued based on observable inputs, primarily unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  Items classified as Level 2 are primarily investments in individual fixed income securities and cash equivalent funds.  Fixed income securities generally do not trade on exchanges and do not have an official closing price but their valuation inputs are based on observable market data.  Pricing vendors calculate bond valuations using financial models and matrices.  The models use observable inputs including yields on benchmark securities, quotes by securities brokers, rating agency actions, discounts or premiums on securities compared to par prices, changes in yields for U.S. Treasury securities, corporate actions by bond issuers, prepayment schedules and histories, economic events and, for certain securities, adjustments to yields to reflect changes in the rate of inflation.  Other securities with model-derived valuation inputs that are observable are also classified as Level 2 investments.  Investments with unobservable valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 investments.  Benefit plan assets included in Level 3 are primarily real estate and private equity investments that are valued using methods requiring judgment including appraisals.  The fair value of real estate investments is measured using market capitalization rates, recent sales of comparable investments and independent third-party appraisals.  The fair value of private equity investments is measured using cost and purchase multiples, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data.  Depending on the specific situation, one or multiple approaches are used to determine the valuation of a real estate or private equity investment.   
    
  Deferred Fuel Costs 
    
  The cost of fuel and related emission allowances and emission control chemicals/consumables is charged to Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expense when the fuel is burned or the allowance or consumable is utilized.  The cost of fuel also includes the cost of nuclear fuel burned which is computed primarily on the units-of-production method.  In regulated jurisdictions with an active FAC, fuel cost over-recoveries (the excess of fuel-related revenues over applicable fuel costs incurred) are generally deferred as current regulatory liabilities and under-recoveries (the excess of applicable fuel costs incurred over fuel-related revenues) are generally deferred as current regulatory assets.  Fuel cost over-recovery and under-recovery balances are classified as noncurrent when there is a phase-in plan or the FAC has been suspended.  These deferrals are amortized when refunded or when billed to customers in later months with the state regulatory commissions  review and approval.  The amount of an over-recovery or under-recovery can also be affected by actions of the state regulatory commissions.  On a routine basis, state regulatory commissions review and/or audit the Registrants  fuel procurement policies and practices, the fuel cost calculations and FAC deferrals.  FAC deferrals are adjusted when costs are no longer probable of recovery or when refunds of fuel reserves are probable. 
    
  Changes in fuel costs, including purchased power in Kentucky for KPCo, Indiana and Michigan for I M, in Ohio (through the ESP related to standard service offer load served through auctions) for OPCo, in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas for SWEPCo, in Oklahoma for PSO, in Virginia and West Virginia (upon securitization in November 2013) for APCo and in West Virginia for WPCo are reflected in rates in a timely manner generally through the FAC.  Changes in fuel costs, including purchased power in Ohio (from 2009 through 2011) for OPCo and in West Virginia for APCo (prior to securitization in November 2013) are reflected in rates through FAC phase-in plans.  The FAC generally includes some sharing of off-system sales margins.  In West Virginia for APCo and WPCo, all of the non-merchant margins from off-system sales are given to customers through the FAC.  Prior to corporate separation, none of the margins from off-system sales were given to customers through the FAC in Ohio for OPCo.  A portion of margins from off-system sales are given to customers through the FAC and other rate mechanisms in Oklahoma for PSO, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas for SWEPCo, Kentucky for KPCo, Virginia for APCo and in Indiana and Michigan for I M.  Where the FAC or off-system sales sharing mechanism is capped, frozen or non-existent, changes in fuel costs or sharing of off-system sales impact earnings. 
    
    138 

    Revenue Recognition 
    
  Regulatory Accounting 
    
  The Registrants  financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that can result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated.  Regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and by matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. 
    
  When regulatory assets are probable of recovery through regulated rates, assets are recorded on the balance sheets.  Regulatory assets are tested for probability of recovery at each balance sheet date or whenever new events occur.  Examples of new events include the issuance of a regulatory commission order or passage of new legislation.  If it is determined that recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, the regulatory asset is written off as a charge against income. 
    
  Electricity Supply and Delivery Activities 
    
  The Registrants recognize revenues from retail and wholesale electricity sales and electricity transmission and distribution delivery services.  The Registrants recognize the revenues on the statements of income upon delivery of the energy to the customer and include unbilled as well as billed amounts.  In accordance with the applicable state commission regulatory treatment, PSO and SWEPCo do not record the fuel portion of unbilled revenue.  Wholesale transmission revenue is based on FERC approved formula rate filings made for each calendar year using estimated costs.  The annual rate filing is compared to actual costs with an over- or under-recovery being trued-up with interest and refunded or recovered in a future year s rates.   
    
  Most of the power produced at the generation plants is sold to PJM or SPP.  The Registrants also purchase power from PJM and SPP to supply power to customers.  Generally, these power sales and purchases are reported on a net basis as revenues on the statements of income.  However, purchases of power in excess of sales to PJM or SPP, on an hourly net basis, used to serve retail load are recorded gross as Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income.  With the exception of certain dedicated load bilateral power supply contracts, the transactions of AEP s nonregulated subsidiaries are reported as gross purchases or sales. 
    
  Physical energy purchases arising from non-derivative contracts are accounted for on a gross basis in Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income.  Energy purchases arising from non-trading derivative contracts are recorded based on the transaction s facts and circumstances.  Purchases under non-trading derivatives used to serve accrual based obligations are recorded in Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income.  All other non-trading derivative purchases are recorded net in revenues. 
    
  In general, the Registrants record expenses when purchased electricity is received and when expenses are incurred, with the exception of certain power purchase contracts that are derivatives and accounted for using MTM accounting where generation/supply rates are not cost-based regulated.  In jurisdictions where the generation/supply business is subject to cost-based regulation, the unrealized MTM amounts are deferred as regulatory assets (for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains). 
    
  Energy Marketing and Risk Management Activities 
    
  The Registrants engage in power, capacity and, to a lesser extent, natural gas marketing as major power producers and participants in electricity and natural gas markets.  The Registrants also engage in power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity risk management activities focused on markets where the AEP System owns assets and adjacent markets.  These activities include the purchase-and-sale of energy under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices.  These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and options.  Certain energy marketing and risk management transactions are with RTOs. 
    139 

    The Registrants recognize revenues and expenses from marketing and risk management transactions that are not derivatives upon delivery of the commodity.  The Registrants use MTM accounting for marketing and risk management transactions that are derivatives unless the derivative is designated in a qualifying cash flow hedge relationship or elected normal under the normal purchase normal sale election.  The Registrants include realized gains and losses on marketing and risk management transactions in revenues or expense based on the transaction s facts and circumstances.  In certain jurisdictions subject to cost-based regulation, unrealized MTM amounts and some realized gains and losses are deferred as regulatory assets (for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains).  Unrealized MTM gains and losses are included on the balance sheets as Risk Management Assets or Liabilities as appropriate. 
    
  Certain qualifying marketing and risk management derivatives transactions are designated as hedges of variability in future cash flows as a result of forecasted transactions (cash flow hedge).  The Registrants initially record the effective portion of the cash flow hedge s gain or loss as a component of AOCI.  When the forecasted transaction is realized and affects net income, the Registrants subsequently reclassify the gain or loss on the hedge from AOCI into revenues or expenses within the same financial statement line item as the forecasted transaction on their statements of income.  In regulated jurisdictions, the ineffective portion is deferred as regulatory assets (for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains).  See  Accounting for Cash Flow Hedging Strategies  section of Note   10  . 
    
  Barging Activities (Applies to AEP) 
    
  AEP River Operations  revenue, which is presented in Discontinued Operations, was recognized based on percentage of voyage completion.  The proportion of freight transportation revenue to be recognized was determined by applying a percentage to the contractual charges for such services.  The percentage was determined by dividing the number of miles from the loading point to the position of the barge as of the end of the accounting period by the total miles to the destination specified in the customer s freight contract.  The position of the barge at accounting period end was determined by AEP s computerized barge tracking system.  See the  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7  . 
    
  SPP Integrated Power Market (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo) 
    
  In March 2014, SPP changed from an energy imbalance service market to a fully integrated power market.  In the past, PSO and SWEPCo would satisfy their load requirements with their own generation resources or through the Operating Agreement.  In the new integrated power market, PSO and SWEPCo operate as standalone entities by offering their respective generation into the SPP power market, which then economically dispatches the resources.  This change further enables retail customers to obtain power through either internal generation or power purchases from the SPP market.  The new integrated power market now operates in a similar manner as the PJM power market for the AEP East Companies.  The change in the SPP integrated power market did not have a significant effect on the results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Levelization of Nuclear Refueling Outage Costs (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  In accordance with regulatory orders, I M defers incremental operation and maintenance costs associated with periodic refueling outages at its Cook Plant and amortizes the costs over the period beginning with the month following the start of each unit s refueling outage and lasting until the end of the month in which the same unit s next scheduled refueling outage begins.  I M adjusts the amortization amount as necessary to ensure full amortization of all deferred costs by the end of the refueling cycle. 
    
  Maintenance 
    
  The Registrants expense maintenance costs as incurred.  If it becomes probable that the Registrants will recover specifically-incurred costs through future rates, a regulatory asset is established to match the expensing of those maintenance costs with their recovery in cost-based regulated revenues.  In certain regulated jurisdictions, the Registrants defer costs above the level included in base rates and amortize those deferrals commensurate with recovery through rate riders. 
    140 

    Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits 
    
  The Registrants use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities which will result in a future tax consequence. 
    
  When the flow-through method of accounting for temporary differences is reflected in regulated revenues (that is, when deferred taxes are not included in the cost of service for determining regulated rates for electricity), deferred income taxes are recorded and related regulatory assets and liabilities are established to match the regulated revenues and tax expense. 
    
  Investment tax credits are accounted for under the flow-through method except where regulatory commissions have reflected investment tax credits in the rate-making process on a deferral basis.  Investment tax credits that have been deferred are amortized over the life of the plant investment. 
    
  The Registrants account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Income Taxes.   The Registrants classify interest expense or income related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense or income as appropriate and classify penalties as Other Operation expense. 
    
  Excise Taxes 
    
  As agents for some state and local governments, the Registrants collect from customers certain excise taxes levied by those state or local governments on customers.  The Registrants do not record these taxes as revenue or expense. 
    
  Debt 
    
  Gains and losses from the reacquisition of debt used to finance regulated electric utility plants are deferred and amortized over the remaining term of the reacquired debt in accordance with their rate-making treatment unless the debt is refinanced.  If the reacquired debt associated with the regulated business is refinanced, the reacquisition costs attributable to the portions of the business that are subject to cost-based regulatory accounting are generally deferred and amortized over the term of the replacement debt consistent with its recovery in rates.  Operations not subject to cost-based rate regulation report gains and losses on the reacquisition of debt in Interest Expense on the statements of income upon reacquisition. 
    
  Debt discount or premium and debt issuance expenses are deferred and amortized generally utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related debt.  The straight-line method approximates the effective interest method and is consistent with the treatment in rates for regulated operations.  The net amortization expense is included in Interest Expense on the statements of income. 
    
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Applies to AEP) 
    
  When AEP acquires businesses, management records the fair value of all assets and liabilities, including intangible assets.  To the extent that consideration exceeds the fair value of identified assets, goodwill is recorded.  Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized.  Management tests acquired goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually at their estimated fair value.  Management tests goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangibles at the asset level.  Fair value is the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available.  In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, management estimates fair value using various internal and external valuation methods.  AEP amortizes intangible assets with finite lives over their respective estimated lives to their estimated residual values.  AEP also reviews the lives of the amortizable intangibles with finite lives on an annual basis. 
    141 

    Investments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities 
    
  AEP has several trust funds with significant investments intended to provide for future payments of pension and OPEB benefits, nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal.  All of the trust funds  investments are diversified and managed in compliance with all laws and regulations.  The investment strategy for the trust funds is to use a diversified portfolio of investments to achieve an acceptable rate of return while managing the investment risk of the assets relative to the associated liabilities.  To minimize investment risk, the trust funds are broadly diversified among classes of assets, investment strategies and investment managers.  Management regularly reviews the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalances the investments to targeted allocations when appropriate.  Investment policies and guidelines allow investment managers in approved strategies to use financial derivatives to obtain or manage market exposures and to hedge assets and liabilities.  The investments are reported at fair value under the  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  accounting guidance. 
    
  Benefit Plans 
    
  All benefit plan assets are invested in accordance with each plan s investment policy.  The investment policy outlines the investment objectives, strategies and target asset allocations by plan. 
    
  The investment philosophies for AEP s benefit plans support the allocation of assets to minimize risks and optimize net returns.  Strategies used include: 

Maintaining a long-term investment horizon. 
                
    Diversifying assets to help control volatility of returns at acceptable levels. 
                
    Managing fees, transaction costs and tax liabilities to maximize investment earnings. 
                
    Using active management of investments where appropriate risk/return opportunities exist. 
                
    Keeping portfolio structure style-neutral to limit volatility compared to applicable benchmarks. 
                
    Using alternative asset classes such as real estate and private equity to maximize return and provide additional portfolio diversification. 
       
  The objective of the investment policy for the pension fund is to maintain the funded status of the plan while providing for growth in the plan assets to offset the growth in the plan liabilities.  The current target asset allocations are as follows: 
                     Pension Plan Assets

The investment policy for each benefit plan contains various investment limitations.  The investment policies establish concentration limits for securities and prohibit the purchase of securities issued by AEP (with the exception of proportionate and immaterial holdings of AEP securities in passive index strategies).  However, the investment policies do not preclude the benefit trust funds from receiving contributions in the form of AEP securities, provided that the AEP securities acquired by each plan may not exceed the limitations imposed by law. 
    
    142 

    For equity investments, the concentration limits are as follows: 

No security in excess of 5% of all equities.  
                
    Cash equivalents must be less than 10% of an investment manager s equity portfolio.  
                
    No individual stock may be more than 10% and 7% for pension and OPEB investments, respectively, of each manager s equity portfolio.  
                
    No investment in excess of 5% of an outstanding class of any company.  
                
    No securities may be bought or sold on margin or other use of leverage.  
       
  For fixed income investments, the concentration limits must not exceed: 

3% in any single issuer.  
                
    5% for private placements.  
                
    5% for convertible securities.  
                
    60% for bonds rated AA+ or lower.  
                
    50% for bonds rated A+ or lower.  
                
    10% for bonds rated BBB- or lower.  
       
  For obligations of non-government issuers within the fixed income portfolio, the following limitations apply: 

AAA rated debt:  a single issuer should account for no more than 5% of the portfolio.  
                
    AA+, AA, AA- rated debt:  a single issuer should account for no more than 3% of the portfolio. 
                
    Debt rated A+ or lower:  a single issuer should account for no more than 2% of the portfolio. 
                
    No more than 10% of the portfolio may be invested in high yield and emerging market debt combined at any time. 
       
  Each investment manager s portfolio is compared to a diversified benchmark index. 
    
  A portion of the pension assets is invested in real estate funds to provide diversification, add return and hedge against inflation.  Real estate properties are illiquid, difficult to value and not actively traded.  The pension plan uses external real estate investment managers to invest in commingled funds that hold real estate properties.  To mitigate investment risk in the real estate portfolio, commingled real estate funds are used to ensure that holdings are diversified by region, property type and risk classification.  Real estate holdings include core, value-added and development risk classifications and some investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts, which are publicly traded real estate securities. 
    
  A portion of the pension assets is invested in private equity.  Private equity investments add return and provide diversification and typically require a long-term time horizon to evaluate investment performance.  Private equity is classified as an alternative investment because it is illiquid, difficult to value and not actively traded.  The pension plan uses limited partnerships and commingled funds to invest across the private equity investment spectrum.   The private equity holdings are with multiple general partners who help monitor the investments and provide investment selection expertise.  The holdings are currently comprised of venture capital, buyout and hybrid debt and equity investment instruments.  Commingled private equity funds are used to enhance the holdings  diversity. 
    
  AEP participates in a securities lending program with BNY Mellon to provide incremental income on idle assets and to provide income to offset custody fees and other administrative expenses.  AEP lends securities to borrowers approved by BNY Mellon in exchange for collateral.  All loans are collateralized by at least 102% of the loaned asset s market value and the collateral is invested.  The difference between the rebate owed to the borrower and the collateral rate of return determines the earnings on the loaned security.  The securities lending program s objective is providing modest incremental income with a limited increase in risk. 
    
    143 

    Trust owned life insurance (TOLI) underwritten by The Prudential Insurance Company is held in the OPEB plan trusts.  The strategy for holding life insurance contracts in the taxable Voluntary Employees  Beneficiary Association  trust is to minimize taxes paid on the asset growth in the trust.  Earnings on plan assets are tax-deferred within the TOLI contract and can be tax-free if held until claims are paid.  Life insurance proceeds remain in the trust and are used to fund future retiree medical benefit liabilities.  With consideration to other investments held in the trust, the cash value of the TOLI contracts is invested in   two   diversified funds.  A portion is invested in a commingled fund with underlying investments in stocks that are actively traded on major international equity exchanges.  The other portion of the TOLI cash value is invested in a diversified, commingled fixed income fund with underlying investments in government bonds, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents are held in each trust to provide liquidity and meet short-term cash needs.  Cash equivalent funds are used to provide diversification and preserve principal.  The underlying holdings in the cash funds are investment grade money market instruments including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, treasury bills and other types of investment grade short-term debt securities.  The cash funds are valued each business day and provide daily liquidity. 
    
  Nuclear Trust Funds (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  Nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel trust funds represent funds that regulatory commissions allow I M to collect through rates to fund future decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal liabilities.  By rules or orders, the IURC, the MPSC and the FERC established investment limitations and general risk management guidelines.  In general, limitations include: 

Acceptable investments (rated investment grade or above when purchased). 
                
    Maximum percentage invested in a specific type of investment. 
                
    Prohibition of investment in obligations of AEP, I M or their affiliates. 
                
    Withdrawals permitted only for payment of decommissioning costs and trust expenses. 
       
  I M maintains trust funds for each regulatory jurisdiction.  Regulatory approval is required to withdraw decommissioning funds.  These funds are managed by external investment managers who must comply with the guidelines and rules of the applicable regulatory authorities.  The trust assets are invested to optimize the net of tax earnings of the trust giving consideration to liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives. 
    
  I M records securities held in these trust funds in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on its balance sheets.  I M records these securities at fair value.  I M classifies securities in the trust funds as available-for-sale due to their long-term purpose.  Other-than-temporary impairments for investments in both debt and equity securities are considered realized losses as a result of securities being managed by an external investment management firm.  The external investment management firm makes specific investment decisions regarding the debt and equity investments held in these trusts and generally intends to sell debt securities in an unrealized loss position as part of a tax optimization strategy.  Impairments reduce the cost basis of the securities which will affect any future unrealized gain or realized gain or loss due to the adjusted cost of investment.  I M records unrealized gains and other-than-temporary impairments from securities in these trust funds as adjustments to the regulatory liability account for the nuclear decommissioning trust funds and to regulatory assets or liabilities for the SNF disposal trust funds in accordance with their treatment in rates.  Consequently, changes in fair value of trust assets do not affect earnings or AOCI.  See the  Nuclear Contingencies  section of Note   6   for additional discussion of nuclear matters.  See  Fair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal  section of Note   11   for disclosure of the fair value of assets within the trusts. 
    
  Comprehensive Income     (Loss) 
    
  Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources.  It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.  Comprehensive income (loss) has two components: net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). 
    144 

    Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Applies to AEP) 
    
  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP had performance units and restricted stock units outstanding under the American Electric Power System Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).  Upon vesting, performance units are paid in cash and restricted stock units are settled in AEP common shares, except for restricted stock units granted after January 1, 2013 and vesting to executive officers, which are paid in cash.  The impact of AEP s stock-based compensation plans are insignificant to the financial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries.  
    
  AEP maintains a variety of tax qualified and nonqualified deferred compensation plans for employees and non-employee directors that include, among other options, an investment in or an investment return equivalent to that of AEP common stock.  This includes AEP career shares maintained under the American Electric Power System Stock Ownership Requirement Plan, which facilitates executives in meeting minimum stock ownership requirements assigned to them by the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors.  AEP career shares are derived from vested performance units granted to employees under the LTIP.  AEP career shares are equal in value to shares of AEP common stock and become payable to executives in cash after their service ends.  AEP career shares accrue additional dividend shares in an amount equal to dividends paid on AEP common shares, and are reinvested in such shares at the closing market price on the dividend payments date. 
    
  AEP compensates their non-employee directors, in part, with stock units under the American Electric Power Company, Inc. Stock Unit Accumulation Plan for Non-Employee Directors.  These stock units become payable in cash to directors after their service ends. 
    
  Management measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.  For share-based payment awards with service only vesting conditions, management recognizes compensation expense using the straight-line single-option method.  Stock-based compensation expense recognized on the statements of income for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   is based on awards ultimately expected to vest.  Therefore, stock-based compensation expense has been reduced to reflect estimated forfeitures.  Accounting guidance for  Compensation - Stock Compensation  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 
    
  For the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , compensation expense is included in Net Income for the performance units, career shares, restricted stock units and the non-employee director s stock units.  See Note   15   for additional discussion. 
    
  Earnings Per Share (EPS) (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding common shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. 
    145 

    The following table presents AEP s basic and diluted EPS calculations included on the statements of income: 

There were   no   antidilutive shares outstanding as of December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . 
    
  OPCo Revised Depreciation Rates (Applies to AEP and OPCo) 
    
  In the second quarter of 2013, OPCo impaired Muskingum River Plant, Unit 5 (MR5).  As a result of the impairment of the full book value of this generating unit, OPCo ceased depreciation on MR5 effective July 1, 2013. 
    
  Supplementary Related Party Information (Applies to AEP) 
    
  AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC.  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP s ownership and investment in OVEC were   43.47%   and   $4.4 million  , respectively. 
    
  OVEC s owners are members to an intercompany power agreement.  Participants of this agreement are entitled to receive and obligated to pay for all OVEC generating capacity, approximately   2,400   MWs, in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of certain AEP utility subsidiaries is   43.47%  .  The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and provide a return on capital.  The intercompany power agreement ends in June 2040. 
    
  AEP and other nonaffiliated owners authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests.  OVEC financed capital expenditures totaling   $1.3 billion   in connection with the engineering and construction of FGD projects and the associated waste disposal landfills at its   two   generation plants.  These environmental projects were funded through debt issuances.  As of December 31,   2015  , both generation plants were operating with environmental controls. 
    
  The following details related party transactions for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  :   

(a)     AEP did not ship coal to OVEC in 2015.

      2  .    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  Upon issuance of final pronouncements, management reviews the new accounting literature to determine its relevance, if any, to the Registrants  business.  The following final pronouncements will impact the financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2014-08  Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant and Equipment  (ASU 2014-08) 
    
  In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08 changing the presentation of discontinued operations on the statements of income and other requirements for reporting discontinued operations.  Under the new standard, a disposal of a component or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results when the component meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale or is disposed.  The amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about discontinued operations and disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations.  This standard must be prospectively applied to all reporting periods presented in financial reports issued after the effective date. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014.  If applicable, this standard will change the presentation of financial statements but will not affect the calculation of net income, comprehensive income or earnings per share.  Management adopted ASU 2014-08 effective January 1, 2015.  
    
  ASU 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (ASU 2014-09) 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 clarifying the method used to determine the timing and requirements for revenue recognition on the statements of income.  Under the new standard, an entity must identify the performance obligations in a contract, determine the transaction price and allocate the price to specific performance obligations to recognize the revenue when the obligation is completed.  The amendments in this update also require disclosure of sufficient information to allow users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contracts. 
    
  The FASB deferred implementation of ASU 2014-09 under the terms in ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic: 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.   The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  As applicable, this standard may change the amount of revenue recognized in the income statements in each reporting period.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption on revenue or net income.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018. 
    
  ASU 2015-01  Income Statement       Extraordinary and Unusual Items  (ASU 2015-01) 
    
  In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01 eliminating the concept of extraordinary items for presentation on the face of the income statement.  Under the new standard, a material event or transaction that is unusual in nature, infrequent or both shall be reported as a separate component of income from continuing operations.  Alternatively, it may be disclosed in the notes to financial statements. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  As applicable, this standard may change the presentation of amounts in the income statements.  Management adopted ASU 2015-01 effective January 1, 2016. 
    
  ASU 2015-03  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  (ASU 2015-03) 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheets.  Under the new standard, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability will be presented on the balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with discounts.  
    
    149 

      The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted.  Management adopted ASU 2015-03 in October 2015 and applied the new standard retrospectively for all periods presented.  Prior to adoption, the Registrants included debt issuance costs in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets.  The effect of the reclassification between assets and liabilities for each Registrant as of December 31, 2014 is disclosed in the table below. 

ASU 2015-05  Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  (ASU 2015-05) 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05 providing guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted.  Management adopted ASU 2015-05 prospectively, effective January 1, 2016, with no impact on results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  
    
  ASU 2015-11  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  (ASU 2015-11) 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 simplifying the guidance on the subsequent measurement of inventory, excluding inventory measured using last-in, first out or the retail inventory method.  Under the new standard, inventory should be at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  Management does not expect the new standard to impact its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2015-11 prospectively, effective January 1, 2017. 
    
  ASU 2015-13  Application of the Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Scope Exception to Certain Electricity Contracts within Nodal Energy Markets  (ASU 2015-13) 
    
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-13 clarifying whether a contract for the purchase or sale of electricity on a forward basis should be eligible to meet the physical delivery criterion of the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception when either the delivery location is within a nodal energy market or the contract necessitates transmission through a nodal energy market and one of the contracting parties incurs charges (or credits) for the transmission of electricity based in part on locational marginal pricing differences payable to (or receivable from) an independent system operator.  Under the new standard, the use of locational marginal pricing by an independent system operator does not cause a contract to fail to meet the physical delivery criterion of the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception.  As a result, an entity may elect to designate that contract as a normal purchase or normal sale. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective upon issuance and applied prospectively.  Management has analyzed the impact of this new standard and determined that it had no impact on the accounting of the Registrants  contracts.  Additionally, adoption had no impact on net income.  Management adopted ASU 2015-13 upon its issuance date.

      ASU 2015-17  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  (ASU 2015-17) 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes on the balance sheets.  Under the new standard, deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent on the balance sheets.  The new accounting guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  Management adopted ASU 2015-17 upon its issuance date and applied the new standard prospectively.  As a result, the new standard impacted the December 31, 2015 presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  
    
  ASU 2016-01  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  (ASU 2016-01) 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 enhancing the reporting model for financial instruments.  Under the new standard, equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  The new standard also amends disclosure requirements and requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  The amendments also clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted.  The amendments should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption on net income.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018.

      4  .    RATE MATTERS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  The Registrants are involved in rate and regulatory proceedings at the FERC and their state commissions.  Rate matters can have a material impact on net income, cash flows and possibly financial condition.  The Registrants  recent significant rate orders and pending rate filings are addressed in this note. 
    
  APCo and WPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and APCo) 
    
  2014 West Virginia Base Rate Case 
    
  In May 2015, the WVPSC issued an order on APCo and WPCo s combined base rate case.  Upon implementation of the order in May 2015, and consistent with the WVPSC authorized total combined revenue, annual base rates were authorized to be increased by   $99 million   (  $85 million   related to APCo) based upon a   9.75%   return on common equity.  The order included a delayed billing of   $25 million   (  $22 million   related to APCo) of the annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016.  The order provided for carrying charges based upon a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate for the $25 million annual delayed billing through June 2016, and stated recovery would be addressed concurrent with the next ENEC change in rates.  Additionally, the order included approval of (a) an initial vegetation management rider of   $45 million   (  $38 million   related to APCo) annually, (b) revised deprecation rates, including recovery of plants to be retired in the second quarter of 2015 and (c) the recovery of   $89 million   (  $77 million   related to APCo) in previously recorded regulatory assets, which will predominantly be recovered over five years.  In February 2016, APCo and WPCo filed a petition with the WVPSC to implement recovery of the delayed billing totaling   $29 million   (  $26 million   related to APCo), which includes carrying charges through June 2016.  Recovery of the $29 million was requested over two years, beginning July 2016, with the unpaid principal subject to carrying charges. 
    
  2015 Virginia Regulatory Asset Proceeding 
    
  In 2015, the Virginia SCC initiated a proceeding to address the proper treatment of APCo s authorized regulatory assets  and briefs related to this proceeding were filed by various parties.  The Virginia SCC has no statutory deadline to issue its decision in this proceeding.  As of   December 31, 2015  , APCo s authorized regulatory assets under review in this proceeding were   $10 million  .  If any of these costs, or any additional costs that may be subject to review, are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  
    
  Virginia Legislation Affecting Biennial Reviews 
    
  In February 2015, amendments to Virginia law governing the regulation of investor-owned electric utilities were enacted.  Under the amended Virginia law, APCo s existing generation and distribution base rates are frozen until after the Virginia SCC rules on APCo s next biennial review, which APCo will file in March 2020 for the 2018 and 2019 test years.  These amendments also preclude the Virginia SCC from performing biennial reviews of APCo s earnings for the years 2014 through 2017.  APCo s financial statements adequately address the impact of these amendments.  The new law provides that APCo will absorb its Virginia jurisdictional share of incremental generation and distribution costs incurred during 2014 through 2017 that are associated with severe weather events and/or natural disasters and costs associated with potential asset impairments related to new carbon emission guidelines issued by the Federal EPA. 
    
  In February 2016, certain APCo industrial customers filed a petition with the Virginia SCC requesting the issuance of a declaratory order that finds the amendments to Virginia law suspending biennial reviews unconstitutional and, accordingly, directs APCo to make biennial review filings beginning March 2016.  In February 2016, APCo filed a motion to stay the Virginia SCC s consideration of the petition due to a pending appeal at the Supreme Court of Virginia by industrial customers of a non-related utility regarding the constitutionality of the 2015 amendments.  Oral arguments at the Virginia SCC are scheduled for March 2016.  Management is unable to predict the outcome of these challenges to the Virginia legislation.  If the biennial review process is reinstated in advance of March 2020, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    163 

      ETT Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP) 
    
  ETT Interim Transmission Rates 
    
  Parent has a   50%   equity ownership interest in ETT.  Predominantly all of ETT s revenues are based on interim rate changes that can be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next filed base rate proceeding.  As of December 31, 2015, AEP s share of ETT s cumulative revenues, subject to review, is estimated to be   $433 million   based upon interim rate increases received from 2009 through 2015.      In November 2015, the PUCT ordered ETT to file a base rate case by February 2017.  A base rate review could produce a refund if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim increase was based.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring.  A refund of interim transmission rates could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  I M Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  Tanners Creek Plant 
    
  In October 2014, I M filed an application with the IURC seeking approval of revised depreciation rates for Rockport Plant, Unit 1 and the Tanners Creek Plant.  Upon retirement of the Tanners Creek Plant, I M proposed that, for purposes of determining its depreciation rates, the net book value of the Tanners Creek Plant be recovered over the remaining life of the Rockport Plant.  The new depreciation rates would result in a decrease in I M s Indiana jurisdictional electric depreciation expense which I M proposed to reduce customer rates through a credit rider.  In May 2015, the IURC issued an order approving I M s request for revised depreciation rates.  Revised depreciation rates were previously approved by the MPSC in 2014, along with a credit rider to reduce customer rates upon retirement of Tanners Creek Plant. 
    
  In May 2015, Tanners Creek Plant was retired.  Upon retirement,   $265 million   was reclassified as Regulatory Assets on the balance sheet related to the net book value of Tanners Creek Plant and is being amortized over   29   years.  An additional   $38 million   was reclassified as Regulatory Assets on the balance sheet for related asset retirement obligations and materials and supplies, which are currently not being amortized, pending regulatory approval. 
    
  Transmission, Distribution and Storage System Improvement Charge (TDSIC) 
    
  In 2014, I M filed petitions with the IURC for approval of a TDSIC Rider and approval of I M s seven-year TDSIC Plan for eligible transmission, distribution and storage system improvements totaling   $787 million  .  In 2015, the IURC granted I M s motion to withdraw its application for reconsideration and/or rehearing and I M withdrew its appeal with the Indiana Court of Appeals. 
    
  KPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Plant Transfer 
    
  Consistent with KPCo s December 2012 plant transfer filing that was approved by the KPSC, Big Sandy Plant, Unit 2 was retired in May 2015.  Upon retirement,   $194 million   was reclassified as Regulatory Assets on the balance sheet related to the net book value of Big Sandy Plant, Unit 2 and the related asset retirement obligations, costs of removal and materials and supplies.  These regulatory assets will be amortized over   25   years, effective July 2015. 
    
  In October 2013, the KPSC issued an order that approved a modified settlement agreement which included the approval to transfer to KPCo a one-half interest in the Mitchell Plant, comprising 780 MW of average annual generating capacity.  In December 2013, the transfer of a one-half interest in the Mitchell Plant to KPCo was completed.  In April 2015, the Franklin County Circuit Court issued an order that affirmed the KPSC s October 2013 order.  In May 2015, the Attorney General filed an appeal with the Kentucky Court of Appeals of the April 2015 order.  In December 2015, KPCo, the Attorney General and the KPSC filed a joint motion to dismiss the appeals filed with the Kentucky Court of Appeals and in February 2016, the joint motion to dismiss was granted.

      Kentucky Fuel Adjustment Clause Review 
    
  In January 2015, the KPSC issued an order disallowing certain FAC costs during the period of January 2014 through May 2015 while KPCo owned and operated both Big Sandy Plant, Unit 2 and its one-half interest in the Mitchell Plant.  As a result of this order, KPCo recorded a regulatory disallowance of   $36 million   in December 2014.  In February 2015, KPCo filed an appeal of this order with the Franklin County Circuit Court.  In September 2015, the Franklin County Circuit Court issued an order that dismissed all appeals filed related to this FAC review, as agreed to by the parties to the stipulation agreement in the  2014 Kentucky Base Rate Case  discussed below. 
    
  2014 Kentucky Base Rate Case 
    
  In December 2014, KPCo filed a request with the KPSC for a net increase in rates of   $70 million  .  In April 2015, a stipulation agreement between KPCo and certain intervenors was filed with the KPSC that recommended a net revenue increase of   $45 million  , which consisted of a   $68 million   increase in rider rates, offset by a   $23 million   decrease in annual base rates, to be effective July 2015.  The proposed net increase reflected KPCo s ownership interest in the Mitchell Plant, riders to recover the Big Sandy Plant retirement and operational costs and the inclusion of an environmental compliance plan.  The proposed net increase of $45 million also included (a) recovery of   $12 million   of deferred storm costs, (b) any difference between the actual off-system sales margins and the   $15 million   included in the proposed annual base rates to be shared with   75%   to the customer and   25%   to KPCo and (c) dismissal of the KPCo and the Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers appeals of the KPSC order in the KPCo fuel adjustment clause review.  See  Kentucky Fuel Adjustment Clause Review  discussed above.  
    
  In June 2015, the KPSC issued an order that approved a modified stipulation agreement.  The order approved a net revenue increase of   $45 million  , as proposed in the stipulation agreement, and contained modifications that included (a) approval to recover   $2 million   of IGCC and certain carbon capture study costs, both over   25   years, (b) no deferral of certain PJM costs and (c) denial of the recovery of certain potential purchased power costs through a rider.  
    
  KGPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Kingsport Base Rate Case 
    
  In September 2015, KGPCo filed a request with the TRA to increase base rates by   $12 million   annually based upon a proposed return on common equity of   10.66%  .  In December 2015, KGPCo withdrew its base rate case filing for administrative purposes and refiled its request with the TRA in January 2016.  If KGPCo does not recover its costs, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  
    
  OPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and OPCo) 
    
  Ohio Electric Security Plan Filings 
    
  2009   2011 ESP 
    
  The PUCO issued an order in March 2009 that modified and approved the ESP which established rates at the start of the April 2009 billing cycle through 2011.  The order also provided a phase-in FAC, which was authorized to be recovered through a non-bypassable surcharge over the period 2012 through 2018. 
    
  In August 2012, the PUCO issued an order in a separate proceeding which implemented a PIRR to recover deferred fuel costs in rates beginning September 2012.  The PUCO ruled that carrying charges should be calculated without an offset for accumulated deferred income taxes and that a long-term debt rate should be applied when collections begin.  In November 2012, OPCo appealed that PUCO order to the Supreme Court of Ohio claiming a long-term debt rate modified the previously adjudicated 2009 - 2011 ESP order, which granted a WACC rate.  In June 2015, the Supreme Court of Ohio issued a decision that reversed the PUCO order on the carrying cost rate issue and dismissed an appeal filed by the IEU.  In September 2015, the Supreme Court of Ohio denied a request for reconsideration filed by the IEU and in October 2015 this matter was remanded back to the PUCO for reinstatement of the WACC rate.  A decision from the PUCO is pending. 
    165 

      June 2012   May 2015 ESP Including Capacity Charge 
    
  In August 2012, the PUCO issued an order which adopted and modified a new ESP that established base generation rates through May 2015.  This ruling was generally upheld in rehearing orders in January and March 2013. 
    
  In July 2012, the PUCO issued an order in a separate capacity proceeding which stated that OPCo must charge CRES providers the RPM price and authorized OPCo to defer a portion of its incurred capacity costs not recovered from CRES providers up to   $188.88  /MW day.  The OPCo RPM price collected from CRES providers, which includes reserve margins, was approximately   $34  /MW day through May 2014 and   $150  /MW day from June 2014 through May 2015.  In December 2012, various parties filed notices of appeal of the capacity costs decision with the Supreme Court of Ohio.  Oral arguments at the Supreme Court of Ohio were held in December 2015.  A decision from the Supreme Court of Ohio is pending. 
    
  As part of the August 2012 ESP order, the PUCO established a non-bypassable RSR, effective September 2012.  The RSR was collected from customers at   $3.50  /MWh through May 2014 and at   $4.00  /MWh for the period June 2014 through May 2015, with   $1.00  /MWh applied to the recovery of deferred capacity costs.  In April 2015, the PUCO issued an order that approved, with modifications, OPCo s July 2014 application to collect the unrecovered portion of the deferred capacity costs.  The order included approval to continue the collection of deferred capacity costs at a rate of   $4.00  /MWh beginning June 1, 2015 for approximately   32   months, with carrying costs at a long-term cost of debt rate.  Additionally, the order stated that an audit will be conducted of the May 31, 2015 capacity deferral balance, which was   $444 million  .  In May 2015, the PUCO granted intervenors requests for rehearing.  As of   December 31, 2015  , OPCo s net deferred capacity costs balance of   $359 million  , including debt carrying costs, was recorded in Regulatory Assets on the balance sheet.  Through   December 31, 2015  , OPCo has collected   $222 million   in deferred capacity costs, and related carrying charges.   
    
  In 2013, the PUCO issued its Orders on Rehearing for the ESP which generally upheld its August 2012 order.  The PUCO clarified that a final reconciliation of revenues and expenses would be permitted for any over- or under-recovery on several riders including fuel.  In addition, the PUCO addressed certain issues around the energy auctions while other SSO issues related to the energy auctions were deferred to a separate docket related to the competitive bid process (CBP).  In 2013, OPCo and various intervenors filed appeals with the Supreme Court of Ohio challenging portions of the PUCO s ESP order.  Oral arguments at the Supreme Court of Ohio were held in May 2015. 
    
  In November 2013, the PUCO issued an order approving OPCo s CBP with modifications.  The PUCO also approved the unbundling of the FAC into fixed and energy-related components and an intervenor proposal to blend the $188.88/MW day capacity price in proportion to the percentage of energy planned to be auctioned.  Additionally, the PUCO ordered that intervenor concerns related to the recovery of the fixed fuel costs through potentially both the FAC and the approved capacity charges be addressed in subsequent FAC proceedings. 
    
  In January 2014, the PUCO denied all rehearing requests and agreed to issue a supplemental request for an independent auditor in the 2012 - 2013 FAC proceeding to separately examine the recovery of the fixed fuel costs, including OVEC.  In March 2014, the PUCO approved OPCo s request to implement riders related to the unbundling of the FAC.  In October 2014, the independent auditor, selected by the PUCO, filed its report for the period August 2012 through May 2015 with the PUCO.  If the PUCO ultimately concludes that a portion of the fixed fuel costs are also recovered through OPCo s $188.88/MW day capacity charge, the independent auditor has recommended a methodology for calculating a refund of a portion of certain fixed fuel costs.  The retail share of these fixed fuel costs is approximately   $90 million   annually.  A hearing related to this matter has not been scheduled.  Management believes that no over-recovery of costs has occurred and disagrees with the findings in the audit report. 
    
  If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect all components of its ESP rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

      June 2015 - May 2018 ESP Including PPA Application 
    
  In December 2013, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve an ESP that included proposed rate adjustments and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders, including the Distribution Investment Rider (DIR), effective June 2015 through May 2018.  The proposal also included a purchased power agreement (PPA) rider that would allow retail customers to receive a rate stabilizing charge or credit by hedging market-based prices with a cost-based PPA.  The PPA would initially be based upon the OVEC contractual entitlement and could, upon further approval, be expanded to include other contracts involving other Ohio legacy generation assets. 
    
  In February 2015, the PUCO issued an order approving OPCo s ESP application, subject to certain modifications, with a return on common equity of   10.2%   on capital costs for certain riders.  The order included (a) approval of the DIR, with modified rate caps established by the PUCO, (b) authorization to establish a zero rate rider for OPCo s proposed PPA, (c) the option for OPCo to reapply in a future proceeding with a more detailed PPA proposal and (d) a directive to continue to pursue the transfer of the OVEC contractual entitlement to AGR or to otherwise divest of its interest in OVEC.  In May 2015, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing that increased the DIR rate caps and deferred ruling on all requests for rehearing related to the establishment of the PPA rider.  In July 2015, the PUCO granted OPCo s and various intervenors  requests for rehearing related to the May 2015 order.  In July 2015, intervenors filed appeals with the Supreme Court of Ohio that included opposition to the authorization of a PPA rider and the modifications to a transmission rider.  In October 2015, the Supreme Court of Ohio granted the PUCO s motion to dismiss these intervenor appeals, without prejudice, since rehearing related to the PPA issues was still pending. 
    
  In October 2014, OPCo filed a separate application with the PUCO to propose a new extended PPA with AGR for 2,671 MW for inclusion in the PPA rider.  In May 2015, OPCo filed an amended PPA application between OPCo and AGR that (a) included OPCo s OVEC contractual entitlement, (b) addressed the PPA requirements set forth in the PUCO s February 2015 order, (c) updated supporting testimony to reflect a current analysis of the PPA proposal and (d) included the 2,671 MW to be available for capacity, energy and ancillary services, produced by AGR over the lives of the respective generating units.  Hearings at the PUCO related to the PPA were concluded in November 2015.  
    
  In December 2015, a non-unanimous stipulation agreement related to the PPA application was filed with the PUCO.  The stipulation agreement is based upon a   10.38%   return on common equity with the PPA Rider term extending through May 2024.  The stipulation agreement included (a) a revised affiliate PPA between OPCo and AGR to be included in the PPA Rider, (b) OPCo s OVEC contractual entitlement, (c) a potential additional customer credit to be included in the PPA Rider, (d) annual compliance reviews before the PUCO and (e) an agreement to retire, refuel or repower, to 100% natural gas, Conesville Plant, Units 5 and 6 and Cardinal Plant, Unit 1 by 2029 and 2030, respectively.  Additionally, OPCo agreed to develop and implement, by 2021, a solar energy project(s) of at least   400   MW and a wind energy project(s) of at least   500   MW, with   100%   of all output to be received by OPCo.  OPCo would own up to   50%   of these solar and wind projects and would include cost recovery in the proposed PPA rider, subject to PUCO review and approval.  OPCo agreed to file a carbon reduction plan with the PUCO by December 2016 that will focus on fuel diversification and carbon emission reductions.  Hearings related to this proposed stipulation agreement were held in January 2016.  Management anticipates receiving an order from the PUCO in the first quarter of 2016.  In January 2016, intervenors filed a complaint at the FERC related to the affiliate PPA.  The complaint asserts that the proposed affiliate PPA between AGR and OPCo is reviewable by the FERC under its standards for affiliate transactions.  
    
  If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect all components of its ESP rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Significantly Excessive Earnings Test Filings 
    
  In January 2011, the PUCO issued an order on the 2009 SEET filing.  The order gave consideration for a future commitment to invest   $20 million   to support the development of a large solar farm.  In January 2013, the PUCO found there was not a need for the large solar farm.  The PUCO noted that OPCo remains obligated to spend $20 million on this solar project or another project.  In September 2013, a proposed second phase of OPCo s   gridSMART        program was filed with the PUCO which included a proposed project to satisfy this PUCO directive.  A decision from the PUCO is pending. 
    167 

      In June 2015, OPCo submitted its 2014 SEET filing with the PUCO.  Management believes its financial statements adequately address the impact of 2014 SEET requirements. 
    
  Corporate Separation 
    
  In October 2012, the PUCO issued an order which approved the corporate separation and transfer of OPCo s generation assets and associated generation liabilities at net book value to AGR.  In June 2013, the IEU filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio claiming the PUCO order approving the corporate separation was unlawful.  In December 2013, corporate separation of OPCo s generation assets was completed.  In December 2015, the IEU withdrew its appeal. 
    
  2009 Fuel Adjustment Clause Audit 
    
  In January 2012, the PUCO issued an order in OPCo s 2009 FAC that the remaining   $65 million   in proceeds from a 2008 coal contract settlement agreement be applied against OPCo s under-recovered fuel balance.  In April 2012, on rehearing, the PUCO ordered that the settlement credit only needed to reflect the Ohio retail jurisdictional share of the gain not already flowed through the FAC with carrying charges.  As a result, OPCo recorded a   $30 million   net favorable adjustment on the statement of income in 2012.  The January 2012 PUCO order also stated that a consultant should be hired to review the coal reserve valuation and recommend whether any additional value should benefit ratepayers.   
    
  In September 2014, the Supreme Court of Ohio upheld the PUCO order on appeal.  A review of the coal reserve valuation by an outside consultant has not been initiated by the PUCO.  If the PUCO ultimately determines that additional amounts should benefit ratepayers as a result of the consultant s review of the coal reserve valuation, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  2012 and 2013 Fuel Adjustment Clause Audits 
    
  In May 2014, the PUCO-selected outside consultant provided its final report related to its 2012 and 2013 FAC audit which included certain unfavorable recommendations related to the FAC recovery for 2012 and 2013.  These recommendations are opposed by OPCo.  In addition, the PUCO will consider the results of the final audit of the recovery of fixed fuel costs that was issued in October 2014.  See the  June 2012 - May 2015 ESP Including Capacity Charge  section above.  If the PUCO orders a reduction to the FAC deferral or a refund to customers, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Ormet 
    
  Ormet, a large aluminum company, had a contract to purchase power from OPCo through 2018.  In 2013, Ormet filed for bankruptcy and subsequently shut down operations.  In March 2014, the PUCO issued an order in OPCo s Economic Development Rider (EDR) filing allowing OPCo to include   $39 million   of Ormet-related foregone revenues in the EDR effective April 2014.  The order stated that if the stipulation agreement between OPCo and Ormet is subsequently adopted by the PUCO, OPCo could file an application to modify the EDR rate for the remainder of the period requesting recovery of the remaining   $10 million   of Ormet deferrals.  In November 2015, the PUCO issued an order approving the stipulation agreement and OPCo s request to recover its remaining   $10 million   of Ormet deferrals through the EDR. 
    
  In addition, in the 2009 - 2011 ESP proceeding, intervenors requested that OPCo be required to refund the Ormet-related revenues under a previous interim arrangement (effective from January 2009 through September 2009) and requested that the PUCO prevent OPCo from collecting Ormet-related revenues in the future.  Through September 2009, the last month of the interim arrangement, OPCo had   $64 million   of deferred FAC costs related to the interim arrangement, excluding   $2 million   of unrecognized equity carrying costs.  The PUCO did not take any action on this request.  The intervenors raised this issue again in response to OPCo s November 2009 filing to approve recovery of the deferral under the interim agreement.  
    
  To the extent amounts discussed above are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

      PSO Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and PSO) 
    
  2015 Oklahoma Base Rate Case 
    
  In July 2015, PSO filed a request with the OCC to increase annual revenues by   $137 million   to recover costs associated with its environmental compliance plan for the Federal EPA s Regional Haze Rule and Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, and to recover investments and other costs that have increased since the last base rate case.  The annual increase consists of (a) a base rate increase of   $89 million  , which includes   $48 million   in increased depreciation expense that reflects, among other things, recovery through June 2026 of Northeastern Plant, Units 3 and 4, (b) a rider or base rate increase of   $44 million   to recover costs for the environmental controls being installed on Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 and the Comanche Plant and (c) a request to include environmental consumable costs in the FAC, estimated to be   $4 million   annually.  The rate increase includes a proposed return on common equity of   10.5%   to be effective in January 2016, except for the   $44 million   for environmental investments, which is effective in March 2016, after the Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 environmental controls go in service.  The total estimated cost of the environmental controls to be installed at Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 and the Comanche Plant is   $219 million  , excluding AFUDC.  As of   December 31, 2015  , PSO had incurred costs of   $190 million   related to these projects, including AFUDC. 
    
  In addition, the filing also notified the OCC that the incremental replacement capacity and energy costs, including the first year effects of new PPAs, estimated to be   $35 million  , will be incurred related to the environmental compliance plan due to the closure of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4 in April 2016, which would be recovered through the FAC.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the net book value of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4 was   $93 million  , before cost of removal, including materials and supplies inventory and CWIP.  
    
  In October 2015, testimony was filed by OCC staff and intervenors with recommendations that included increases to base rates and/or the proposed environmental rider ranging from   $10 million   to   $31 million  , based upon returns on common equity ranging from   8.75%   to   9.3%  , and increases to depreciation expense ranging from   $23 million   to   $46 million  .  Additionally, recommendations by certain intervenors included (a) no recovery of PSO s investment in Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 environmental controls, (b) no recovery of the plant balances at the time the units are retired in 2016 and 2026, (c) denial of returns on the book values after the retirement dates, or to be set at only the cost of debt, and (d) the disallowance of the capacity costs associated with the PPAs.  Additionally, some intervenors did not support an increase in depreciation expense for the Northeastern Plant, Units 3 and 4 to permit cost recovery by Unit 3 s 2026 retirement date as the proposals called for no change in existing cost recovery by 2040.  Hearings at the OCC were held in December 2015.  In January 2016, PSO implemented an interim annual base rate increase of   $75 million  .  These interim rates are subject to refund pending a final order from the OCC related to the initial $137 million request.  An order from the OCC is anticipated in the second quarter of 2016.   
    
  If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  2014 Oklahoma Base Rate Case 
    
  In April 2015, the OCC issued an order that approved a stipulation agreement between PSO, the OCC staff and certain intervenors.  The approved stipulation provides for no overall change to the transmission rider or to annual revenues, other than additional revenues through a separate rider related to advanced metering costs and that the terms of the stipulation be effective November 2014.  The advanced metering rider provides   $24 million   of revenues over   14   months beginning in November 2014 and increases to   $27 million   in 2016.  The stipulation also included (a) new depreciation rates for advanced metering investments and existing meters, also effective November 2014, (b) a return on common equity of   9.85%   to be used only in the formula to calculate AFUDC, factoring of customer receivables and for riders with an equity component and (c) recovery of regulatory assets for 2013 storms and regulatory case expenses.  The advanced metering cost rider was implemented in November 2014.

      SWEPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
    
  2012 Texas Base Rate Case 
    
  In 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk Plant.  In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo s recovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs.  Additionally, the PUCT deferred consideration of the requested increase in depreciation expense related to the change in the 2016 retirement date of the Welsh Plant, Unit 2.   
    
  Upon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap.  As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2013, SWEPCo reversed   $114 million   of previously recorded regulatory disallowances.  The resulting annual base rate increase was approximately   $52 million  .  In May 2014, intervenors filed appeals of that order with the Texas District Court.  In June 2014, SWEPCo intervened in those appeals and filed initial responses. 
    
  If certain parts of the PUCT order are overturned or if SWEPCo cannot ultimately recover its Texas jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant investment, including AFUDC, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
  2012 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing 
    
  In 2012, SWEPCo initiated a proceeding to establish new formula base rates in Louisiana, including recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share (approximately   29%  ) of the Turk Plant.  In February 2013, a settlement was filed and approved by the LPSC.  The settlement increased SWEPCo s Louisiana total rates by approximately   $2 million   annually, effective March 2013, which consisted of an increase in base rates of approximately   $85 million   annually offset by a decrease in fuel and other rates of approximately   $83 million   annually.  The March 2013 base rates are based on a   10%   return on common equity and cost recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant and Stall Unit.  The rates are subject to refund based on the prudency review of the Turk Plant.  The settlement also provided that the LPSC review base rates in 2014 and 2015 and that SWEPCo recover non-fuel Turk Plant costs and a full weighted-average cost of capital return on the prudently incurred Turk Plant investment in jurisdictional rate base, effective January 2013.  In December 2014, the LPSC approved a settlement agreement related to the staff review of the cost of service.  The settlement agreement reduced the requested revenue increase by   $3 million  , primarily due to the timing of both the allowed recovery of certain existing regulatory assets and the establishment of a regulatory asset for certain previously expensed costs.  If the LPSC orders refunds based upon the pending prudence review of the Turk Plant investment, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  
    
  2014 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing 
    
  In April 2014, SWEPCo filed its annual formula rate plan for test year 2013 with the LPSC.  The filing included a   $5 million   annual increase, which was effective August 2014.  SWEPCo also proposed to increase rates by an additional   $15 million   annually, effective January 2015, for a total annual increase of   $20 million  .  This additional increase reflects the cost of incremental generation to be used to serve Louisiana customers in 2015 due to the expiration of a purchased power agreement attributable to Louisiana customers.  In December 2014, the LPSC approved a partial settlement agreement that included the implementation of the   $15 million   annual increase in rates effective January 2015.  These increases are subject to LPSC staff review and are subject to refund.   If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.   
    
    170 

      2015 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing 
    
  In April 2015, SWEPCo filed its formula rate plan for test year 2014 with the LPSC.  The filing included a   $14 million   annual increase, which was effective August 2015.  This increase is subject to LPSC staff review and is subject to refund.   If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Welsh Plant - Environmental Impact 
    
  Management currently estimates that the investment necessary to meet proposed environmental regulations through 2025 for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 could cost approximately   $900 million  ,   excluding AFUDC.  As part of this investment, SWEPCo is currently constructing environmental control projects to meet Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 at a cost of approximately   $400 million  , excluding AFUDC.  As of   December 31, 2015  , SWEPCo had incurred costs of   $343 million  , including AFUDC, and had remaining contractual construction obligations of   $40 million   related to these projects.  SWEPCo will seek recovery of these project costs from customers through filings at the state commissions and the FERC.  Management continues to evaluate the impact of environmental rules and related project cost estimates.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the net book value of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 was   $578 million  , before cost of removal, including materials and supplies inventory and CWIP.  Welsh Plant, Unit 2 is scheduled for retirement during 2016 and is probable of abandonment.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the net book value of Welsh Plant, Unit 2 was   $82 million  , before cost of removal, including materials and supplies inventory and CWIP. 
    
  If any of these costs are not recoverable, including retirement-related costs for Welsh Plant, Unit 2, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

      6  .    COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  The Registrants are subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.  In addition, the Registrants business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment.  The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Registrants cannot be predicted.  Management accrues contingent liabilities only when management concludes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  When management determines that it is not probable, but rather reasonably possible that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, management discloses such contingencies and the possible loss or range of loss if such estimate can be made.  Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties.  Any estimated range of possible loss may not represent the maximum possible loss exposure.  Circumstances change over time and actual results may vary significantly from estimates. 
     
  For current proceedings not specifically discussed below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
    COMMITMENTS 
    
  Construction and Commitments 
    
  The AEP System has substantial construction commitments to support its operations and environmental investments.  In managing the overall construction program and in the normal course of business, AEP subsidiaries contractually commit to third-party construction vendors for certain material purchases and other construction services.  Fuel, materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment are also purchased under contract as part of the normal course of business.  Certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination. 
    
  In accordance with the accounting guidance for  Commitments , the following tables summarize the Registrants  actual contractual commitments as of December 31,   2015  : 

185 

(a) 
    Represents contractual commitments to purchase coal, natural gas, uranium and other consumables as fuel for electric generation along with related transportation of the fuel. 
              (b) 
    Represents only capital assets for which there are signed contracts.  Actual payments are dependent upon and may vary significantly based upon the decision to build, regulatory approval schedules, timing and escalation of project costs. 
       
    GUARANTEES 
    
  Liabilities for guarantees are recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Guarantees.   There is no collateral held in relation to any guarantees.  In the event any guarantee is drawn, there is no recourse to third parties unless specified below. 
    
  Letters of Credit (Applies to AEP, APCo, I M and OPCo) 
    
  Standby letters of credit are entered into with third parties.  These letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business and cover items such as natural gas and electricity risk management contracts, construction contracts, insurance programs, security deposits and debt service reserves. 
    
  AEP has two revolving credit facilities totaling   $3.5 billion  , under which up to   $1.2 billion   may be issued as letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries.  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP s maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facilities were   $23 million   with maturities ranging from February 2016 to December 2016.  In January 2016, the letter of credit maturing in February 2016 was replaced with a new letter of credit expiring in January 2017. 
    
    186 

    An uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility.  AEP also issues letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under three uncommitted facilities totaling   $225 million  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Registrants  maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities were as follows:  

The Registrants have $477 million of variable rate Pollution Control Bonds supported by $482 million of bilateral letters of credit as follows: 

Guarantees of Third-Party Obligations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
    
  As part of the process to receive a renewal of a Texas Railroad Commission permit for lignite mining, SWEPCo provides guarantees of mine reclamation of   $115 million  .  Since SWEPCo uses self-bonding, the guarantee provides for SWEPCo to commit to use its resources to complete the reclamation in the event the work is not completed by Sabine.  This guarantee ends upon depletion of reserves and completion of final reclamation.  Based on the latest study completed in 2010, it is estimated the reserves will be depleted in 2036 with final reclamation completed by 2046 at an estimated cost of approximately   $58 million  .  Actual reclamation costs could vary due to period inflation and any changes to actual mine reclamation.  As of   December 31, 2015  , SWEPCo has collected approximately   $65 million   through a rider for final mine closure and reclamation costs, of which   $15 million   is recorded in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities and   $50 million   is recorded in Asset Retirement Obligations on SWEPCo s balance sheet.   
    
  Sabine charges SWEPCo, its only customer, all of its costs.  SWEPCo passes these costs to customers through its fuel clause. 
    
  Indemnifications and Other Guarantees 
    
  Contracts 
    
  The Registrants enter into certain types of contracts which require indemnifications.  Typically these contracts include, but are not limited to, sale agreements, lease agreements, purchase agreements and financing agreements.  Generally, these agreements may include, but are not limited to, indemnifications around certain tax, contractual and environmental matters.  With respect to sale agreements, exposure generally does not exceed the sale price.  As of December 31,   2015  , there were no material liabilities recorded for any indemnifications. 
    
  APCo, I M and OPCo are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted by AEPSC on behalf of AEP companies related to power purchase and sale activity.  PSO and SWEPCo are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted by AEPSC on behalf of PSO and SWEPCo related to power purchase and sale activity. 
    
    187 

    Lease Obligations 
    
  Certain Registrants lease certain equipment under master lease agreements.  See  Master Lease Agreements ,  Railcar Lease  and  AEPRO Boat and Barge Leases  sections of Note   13   for disclosure of lease residual value guarantees. 
    
    ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES 
    
  The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation  
    
  By-products from the generation of electricity include materials such as ash, slag, sludge, low-level radioactive waste and SNF.  Coal combustion by-products, which constitute the overwhelming percentage of these materials, are typically treated and deposited in captive disposal facilities or are beneficially utilized.  In addition, the generation plants and transmission and distribution facilities have used asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and other hazardous and nonhazardous materials.  The Registrants currently incur costs to dispose of these substances safely. 
    
  Superfund addresses clean-up of hazardous substances that are released to the environment.  The Federal EPA administers the clean-up programs.  Several states enacted similar laws.  As of December 31,   2015  , APCo and OPCo are named as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) for one site and three sites, respectively, by the Federal EPA for which alleged liability is unresolved.  There are nine additional sites for which APCo, I M, OPCo, SWEPCo and other AEP subsidiaries received information requests which could lead to PRP designation.  I M has also been named potentially liable at two sites under state law including the I M site discussed in the next paragraph.  SWEPCo has also been named potentially liable at one site under state law.  In those instances where a PRP or defendant has been named, disposal or recycling activities were in accordance with the then-applicable laws and regulations.  Superfund does not recognize compliance as a defense, but imposes strict liability on parties who fall within its broad statutory categories.  Liability has been resolved for a number of sites with no significant effect on net income. 
    
  In 2008, I M received a letter from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) concerning conditions at a site under state law and requesting I M take voluntary action necessary to prevent and/or mitigate public harm.  I M started remediation work in accordance with a plan approved by MDEQ.  In 2014, I M recorded an accrual for remediation at certain additional sites in Michigan.  As a result of receiving approval of completed remediation work from the MDEQ in March 2015, I M s accrual was reduced.  As of December 31,   2015  , I M s accrual for all of these sites is   $8 million  .  As the remediation work is completed, I M s cost may change as new information becomes available concerning either the level of contamination at the sites or changes in the scope of remediation.  Management cannot predict the amount of additional cost, if any. 
    
  Management evaluates the potential liability for each Superfund site separately, but several general statements can be made about potential future liability.  Allegations that materials were disposed at a particular site are often unsubstantiated and the quantity of materials deposited at a site can be small and often nonhazardous.  Although Superfund liability has been interpreted by the courts as joint and several, typically many parties are named as PRPs for each site and several of the parties are financially sound enterprises.  At present, management s estimates do not anticipate material cleanup costs for identified Superfund sites, except the I M sites discussed above. 
    
  NUCLEAR CONTINGENCIES (APPLIES TO AEP AND I M) 
    
  I M owns and operates the two-unit 2,191 MW Cook Plant under licenses granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  I M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of SNF and to safely decommission and decontaminate the plant.  The licenses to operate the two nuclear units at the Cook Plant expire in 2034 and 2037.  The operation of a nuclear facility also involves special risks, potential liabilities and specific regulatory and safety requirements.  By agreement, I M is partially liable, together with all other electric utility companies that own nuclear generation units, for a nuclear power plant incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S.  Should a nuclear incident occur at any nuclear power plant in the U.S., the resultant liability could be substantial. 
    
    188 

    Decommissioning and Low Level Waste Accumulation Disposal  
    
  The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations and the SNF disposal program.  Decommissioning costs are accrued over the service life of the Cook Plant.  The most recent decommissioning cost study was performed in 2015.  According to that study, the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste is   $1.6 billion   in 2015 nondiscounted dollars, with additional ongoing costs of   $5 million   per year for post decommissioning storage of SNF and an eventual cost of   $57 million   for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility, also in 2015 nondiscounted dollars.  I M recovers estimated decommissioning costs for the Cook Plant in its rates.  The amounts recovered in rates were   $9 million  ,   $9 million   and   $10 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  Decommissioning costs recovered from customers are deposited in external trusts. 
     
  As of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , the total decommissioning trust fund balance was   $1.8 billion   and   $1.8 billion  , respectively.  Trust fund earnings increase the fund assets and decrease the amount remaining to be recovered from ratepayers.  The decommissioning costs (including interest, unrealized gains and losses and expenses of the trust funds) increase or decrease the recorded liability. 
    
  I M continues to work with regulators and customers to recover the remaining estimated costs of decommissioning the Cook Plant.  However, future net income and cash flows would be reduced and financial condition could be impacted if the cost of SNF disposal and decommissioning continues to increase and cannot be recovered. 
    
  SNF Disposal 
    
  The federal government is responsible for permanent SNF disposal and assesses fees to nuclear plant owners for SNF disposal.  A fee of one mill per KWh for fuel consumed after April 6, 1983 at the Cook Plant is being collected from customers and remitted to the U.S. Treasury.  This fee was terminated in May 2014.  As of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , fees and related interest of   $266 million   and   $266 million  , respectively, for fuel consumed prior to April 7, 1983 have been recorded as Long-term Debt and funds collected from customers along with related earnings totaling   $309 million   and   $309 million  , respectively, to pay the fee are recorded as part of Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts.  I M has not paid the government the pre-April 1983 fees due to continued delays and uncertainties related to the federal disposal program. 
    
  In 2011, I M signed a settlement agreement with the federal government which permits I M to make annual filings to recover certain SNF storage costs incurred as a result of the government s delays in accepting SNF for permanent storage.  Under the settlement agreement, I M received   $13 million  ,   $22 million   and   $31 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, to recover costs and will be eligible to receive additional payment of annual claims for allowed costs that are incurred through December 31, 2016.  The proceeds reduced costs for dry cask storage.  As of December 31,   2015  , I M has deferred   $6 million   in Prepayments and Other Current Assets and   $21 million   in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheet of dry cask storage and related operation and maintenance costs for recovery under this agreement. 
    
  See  Fair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal  section of Note   11   for disclosure of the fair value of assets within the trusts. 
    
  Nuclear Incident Liability  
    
  I M carries insurance coverage for a nuclear incident at the Cook Plant for property damage, decommissioning and decontamination in the amount of   $2.8 billion  .  Insurance coverage for a nonnuclear incident at the Cook Plant is   $1.7 billion  .  Additional insurance provides coverage for a weekly indemnity payment resulting from an insured accidental outage.  I M utilizes industry mutual insurers for the placement of this insurance coverage.  Participation in this mutual insurance requires a contingent financial obligation of up to   $49 million   for I M which is assessable if the insurer s financial resources would be inadequate to pay for losses.  
    189 

    The Price-Anderson Act, extended through December 31, 2025, establishes insurance protection for public liability arising from a nuclear incident at   $13.5 billion   and covers any incident at a licensed reactor in the U.S.  Commercially available insurance, which must be carried for each licensed reactor, provides   $375 million   of coverage.  In the event of a nuclear incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S., the remainder of the liability would be provided by a deferred premium assessment of   $127 million   on each licensed reactor in the U.S. payable in annual installments of   $19 million  .  As a result, I M could be assessed   $255 million   per nuclear incident payable in annual installments of   $38 million  .  The number of incidents for which payments could be required is not limited.  
    
  In the event of an incident of a catastrophic nature, I M is initially covered for the first   $375 million   through commercially available insurance.  The next level of liability coverage of up to   $13.1 billion   would be covered by claims made under the Price-Anderson Act.  If the liability were in excess of amounts recoverable from insurance and retrospective claim payments made under the Price-Anderson Act, I M would seek to recover those amounts from customers through rate increases.  In the event nuclear losses or liabilities are underinsured or exceed accumulated funds and recovery from customers is not possible, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  
    
  OPERATIONAL CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Insurance and Potential Losses  
    
  The Registrants maintain insurance coverage normal and customary for electric utilities, subject to various deductibles.  The Registrants also maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain physical damage or third-party injuries caused by cyber security incidents.  Insurance coverage includes all risks of physical loss or damage to nonnuclear assets, subject to insurance policy conditions and exclusions.  Covered property generally includes power plants, substations, facilities and inventories.  Excluded property generally includes transmission and distribution lines, poles and towers.  The insurance programs also generally provide coverage against loss arising from certain claims made by third parties and are in excess of retentions absorbed by the Registrants.  Coverage is generally provided by a combination of the protected cell of EIS and/or various industry mutual and/or commercial insurance carriers. 
    
  See  Nuclear Contingencies  section of this footnote for a discussion of I M s nuclear exposures and related insurance. 
    
  Some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities relating to a cyber security incident or damage to the Cook Plant and costs of replacement power in the event of an incident at the Cook Plant.  Future losses or liabilities, if they occur, which are not completely insured, unless recovered from customers, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Rockport Plant Litigation (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  In July 2013, the Wilmington Trust Company filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AEGCo and I M alleging that it will be unlawfully burdened by the terms of the modified NSR consent decree after the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease expiration in December 2022.  The terms of the consent decree allow the installation of environmental emission control equipment, repowering or retirement of the unit.  The plaintiff further alleges that the defendants  actions constitute breach of the lease and participation agreement.  The plaintiff seeks a judgment declaring that the defendants breached the lease, must satisfy obligations related to installation of emission control equipment and indemnify the plaintiff.  The New York court granted a motion to transfer this case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  In October 2013, a motion to dismiss the case was filed on behalf of AEGCo and I M.  In January 2015, the court issued an opinion and order granting the motion in part and denying the motion in part.  The court dismissed certain of the plaintiff s claims.  Several claims remain, including the claim for breach of the participation agreement and a claim alleging breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  In June 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion for partial judgment on the claims seeking dismissal of the breach of participation agreement claim as well as any claim for indemnification of costs associated with this case.  The plaintiff  
    190 

    subsequently filed an amended complaint to add another claim under the lease and also filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  In November 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion to strike the plaintiff s motion for partial judgment and filed a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim.  Management will continue to defend against the remaining claims.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring. 
    
  Natural Gas Markets Lawsuits (Applies to AEP) 
    
  In 2002, the Lieutenant Governor of California filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County California Superior Court against numerous energy companies, including AEP, alleging violations of California law through alleged fraudulent reporting of false natural gas price and volume information with an intent to affect the market price of natural gas and electricity.  AEP was dismissed from the case.  A number of similar cases were also filed in California and in state and federal courts in several states making essentially the same allegations under federal or state laws against the same companies.  AEP (or a subsidiary) is among the companies named as defendants in some of these cases.  AEP settled, received summary judgment or was dismissed from all of these cases.  The plaintiffs appealed the Nevada federal district court s dismissal of several cases involving AEP companies to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  In April 2013, the appellate court reversed in part, and affirmed in part, the district court s orders in these cases.  The appellate court reversed the district court s holding that the state antitrust claims were preempted by the Natural Gas Act and the order dismissing AEP from two of the cases on personal jurisdiction grounds and affirmed the decision denying leave to the plaintiffs to amend their complaints in two of the cases.  Defendants in these cases, including AEP, filed a petition seeking further review with the U.S. Supreme Court on the preemption issue.  AEP also subsequently filed a separate petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the personal jurisdiction issue.  In July 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the defendants  previously filed petition for further review with the U.S. Supreme Court on the preemption issue.  Oral argument occurred in January 2015.  In April 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on the preemption issue, holding that the plaintiffs  state antitrust claims were not preempted by the Natural Gas Act.  The U.S. Supreme Court denied AEP s petition for review of the personal jurisdiction issue shortly thereafter.  The cases were remanded to the district court for further proceedings.  There are four pending cases, of which three are class actions and one is a single plaintiff case.  A tentative settlement has been reached in the three class actions.  This settlement, once finalized, will be subject to court approval.  Management will continue to defend the remaining case.  Management is unable to determine the amount of potential additional loss that is reasonably possible of occurring. 
    
  Wage and Hours Lawsuit (Applies to AEP and PSO) 
    
  In August 2013, PSO received an amended complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma by 36 current and former line and warehouse employees alleging that they were denied overtime pay in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to overtime pay for  on call  time.  They allege that restrictions placed on them during on call hours are burdensome enough that they are entitled to compensation for these hours as hours worked.  Plaintiffs also filed a motion to conditionally certify this action as a class action, claiming there are an additional 70 individuals similarly situated to plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs seek damages in the amount of unpaid overtime over a three-year period and liquidated damages in the same amount. 
    
  In March 2014, the federal court granted plaintiffs  motion to conditionally certify the action as a class action.  Notice was given to all potential class members and an additional 44 individuals opted in to the class, bringing the plaintiff class to 80 current and former employees.  Two plaintiffs have since dismissed their claims without prejudice, leaving 78 plaintiffs.  In January 2016, the plaintiffs  lead counsel filed a motion to withdraw from the case and the motion was denied by the court.  Subsequently, a motion to dismiss without prejudice was filed on behalf of 35 named plaintiffs.  In February 2016, PSO filed a motion for summary judgment.  Management will continue to defend the case.  Management does not believe a loss is probable.  If there is an unfavorable outcome contrary to expectations, management estimates possible losses of up to   $30 million  . 
    191 

    National Do Not Call Registry Lawsuit (Applies to AEP) 
  In May 2014, AEP Energy was served with a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).  The plaintiff alleges that he received telemarketing calls on behalf of AEP Energy despite having registered his telephone number on the National Do Not Call Registry.  Plaintiff seeks to represent a class of persons who allegedly received such calls.   Plaintiff seeks statutory damages under the TCPA on behalf of himself and the alleged class as well as injunctive relief.  As a result of a mediation held in October 2014, the parties reached an agreement in principle, subject to final documentation and preliminary and final court approval.  The court granted final approval of the settlement in September 2015 and terminated the case in November 2015.  The settlement had an immaterial impact to AEP s financial statements.  
    
  Gavin Landfill Litigation (Applies to AEP and OPCo) 
  In August 2014, a complaint was filed in the Mason County, West Virginia Circuit Court against AEP, AEPSC, OPCo and an individual supervisor alleging wrongful death and personal injury/illness claims arising out of purported exposure to coal combustion by-product waste at the Gavin Plant landfill.  The lawsuit was filed on behalf of 77 plaintiffs, consisting of 39 current and former contractors of the landfill and 38 family members of those contractors.  Eleven of the family members are pursuing personal injury/illness claims and the remainder are pursuing loss of consortium claims.  The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, as well as medical monitoring.  In September 2014, management filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, contending the case should be filed in Ohio.  In August 2015, the court denied the motion.  Management appealed that decision to the West Virginia Supreme Court.  In February 2016, a decision was issued by the court denying the appeal and remanding the case to the West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel rather than back to the Mason County, West Virginia Circuit Court.  Management will continue to defend against the claims.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring.

  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  DISPOSITIONS 
    
  2015 
    
  AEPRO (Corporate and Other) (Applies to AEP) 
    
  In October 2015, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in November 2015 and resulted in a net gain of   $253 million   that was recorded in Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax, on the statement of income.  AEP received net cash proceeds from the sale of   $491 million  , which were immediately available for use in AEP s continuing operations.  The cash proceeds of   $539 million   were recorded in Discontinued Investing Activities on the statement of cash flows.  These proceeds were reduced by a make whole payment on the extinguishment of AEPRO long-term debt of   $32 million  , which was recorded in Discontinued Financing Activities, and transaction costs of   $16 million  , which were recorded in Discontinued Operating Activities, on the statement of cash flows.  The nonaffiliated party acquired AEPRO by purchasing all of the common stock of AEP Resources, Inc., the parent company of AEPRO.  The nonaffiliated party assumed certain assets and liabilities of AEPRO, excluding the equity method investment in IMT, pension and benefit assets and liabilities and debt obligations.  Prior to the closing of the sale, AEP retired the debt obligations of AEPRO.  AEP retained ownership of its captive barge fleet that delivers coal to the company s regulated coal-fueled power plant units owned or leased by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo.  AEP signed a contract with the nonaffiliated party to dispatch and schedule its captive barge fleet for the company s regulated coal-fueled power plant units.  AEP also has a separate contract with the nonaffiliated party to barge coal for AGR.  These agreements with the nonaffiliated party extend through the end of 2016.   
    
  In the third quarter of 2015, AEPRO was determined to be discontinued operations and subsequently classified as held for sale.  The assets and liabilities were classified as Assets from Discontinued Operations and Liabilities from Discontinued Operations, respectively, on AEP s balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 and as shown in the following table: 

193 

      Results of operations of AEPRO have been classified as discontinued operations on AEP s statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 as shown in the following table: 

Muskingum River Plant (Generation   Marketing segment) (Applies to AEP) 
    
  In August 2015, AGR sold its retired Muskingum River Plant site including its associated Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) to a nonaffiliated party.  AGR paid   $48 million   and the nonaffiliated party took ownership of the Muskingum River Plant site assets and assumed responsibility for environmental liabilities and ARO, including ash pond closure, asbestos abatement and decommissioning and demolition.  As a result of the sale, a net gain of   $32 million   was recognized and recorded in Other Operation on the statement of income.  The cash paid was recorded in Operating Activities on the statements of cash flows.   
    
  2013 
    
  Conesville Coal Preparation Company (Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment) (Applies to AEP and OPCo) 
    
  In April 2013, OPCo closed on the sale of its Conesville Coal Preparation Company.  This sale did not have a significant impact on OPCo s financial statements. 
    
    194 

      IMPAIRMENTS 
    
  2013 
    
  Amos Plant, Unit 3 (Vertically Integrated Utilities segment) (Applies to AEP and APCo) 
    
  In July 2013, the Virginia SCC approved the transfer of OPCo s two-thirds interest in the Amos Plant, Unit 3 to APCo but, for rate purposes, reduced the proposed transfer price by   $83 million   pretax.  The Virginia jurisdictional share of the reduced price was approximately   $39 million  .  As a result of the Virginia order, in the fourth quarter of 2013, management recorded a pretax impairment of   $39 million   in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statement of income.  No impairment was recorded for the West Virginia jurisdictional share as these amounts were approved for recovery in the 2014 West Virginia Base Rate Case. 
    
  Big Sandy Plant, Unit 2 FGD Project (Vertically Integrated Utilities segment) (Applies to AEP) 
    
  In the third quarter of 2013, KPCo recorded a pretax write-off of   $33 million   in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statement of income primarily related to the Big Sandy Plant, Unit 2 FGD project as disallowed by the KPSC.   
    
  Muskingum River Plant, Unit 5 (Generation   Marketing segment) (Applies to AEP and OPCo) 
    
  In May 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio approved a modification to the consent decree, which was initially entered into in 2007, requiring certain types of pollution control equipment to be installed at certain AEP plants, including OPCo s 600 MW Muskingum River Plant, Unit 5 (MR5) coal-fired generation plant.  Under the modification to the consent decree, OPCo had the option to cease burning coal and retire MR5 in 2015 or to cease burning coal in 2015 and complete a natural gas refueling project no later than June 2017.  In the second quarter of 2013, based on the approval of the modified consent decree and changes in other market factors, management re-evaluated potential courses of action with respect to the planned operation of MR5 and concluded that completion of a refueling project, which would have extended the useful life of MR5, is remote.  As a result, management completed an impairment analysis and concluded that MR5 was impaired.  Under a market-based value approach, using level 3 unobservable inputs, management determined that the fair value of this generating unit was zero based on the lack of installed environmental control equipment and the nature and condition of this generating unit.  In the second quarter of 2013, management recorded a pretax impairment of   $154 million   in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statement of income which includes a   $6 million   pretax impairment of related material and supplies inventory.  The plant was retired in May 2015.

      8  .    BENEFIT PLANS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  For a discussion of investment strategy, investment limitations, target asset allocations and the classification of investments within the fair value hierarchy, see  Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities  and  Investments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities  sections of Note   1  . 
    
  AEP sponsors a qualified pension plan and two unfunded nonqualified pension plans.  Substantially all AEP employees are covered by the qualified plan or both the qualified and a nonqualified pension plan.  AEP also sponsors OPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees. 
    
  Due to the Registrant Subsidiaries  participation in AEP s benefits plans, the assumptions used by the actuary and the accounting for the plans by each subsidiary are the same.  This section details the assumptions that apply to all Registrants and the rate of compensation increase for each Registrant. 
    
  The Registrants recognize the funded status associated with defined benefit pension and OPEB plans in the balance sheets.  Disclosures about the plans are required by the  Compensation   Retirement Benefits  accounting guidance.  The Registrants recognize an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status, and recognize, as a component of other comprehensive income, the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year that are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost.  The Registrants record a regulatory asset instead of other comprehensive income for qualifying benefit costs of regulated operations that for ratemaking purposes are deferred for future recovery.  The cumulative funded status adjustment is equal to the remaining unrecognized deferrals for unamortized actuarial losses or gains, prior service costs and transition obligations, such that remaining deferred costs result in an AOCI equity reduction or regulatory asset and deferred gains result in an AOCI equity addition or regulatory liability. 
    
  Actuarial Assumptions for Benefit Obligations 
    
  The weighted-average assumptions as of December 31 of each year used in the measurement of the Registrants  benefit obligations are shown in the following tables: 

(a) 
    Rates are for base pay only.  In addition, an amount is added to reflect target incentive compensation for exempt employees and overtime and incentive pay for nonexempt employees. 
       
  A duration-based method is used to determine the discount rate for the plans.  A hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds is constructed with cash flows matching the benefit plan liability.  The composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio is used as the discount rate for the plan.  The discount rate is the same for each Registrant. 
    
    196 

      For   2015  , the rate of compensation increase assumed varies with the age of the employee, ranging from   3.5%   per year to   12%   per year, with the average increase shown in the table above.  The compensation increase rates reflect variations in each Registrants  population participating in the pension plan. 
    
  Actuarial Assumptions for Net Periodic Benefit Costs 
    
  The weighted-average assumptions as of January 1 of each year used in the measurement of each Registrants  benefit costs are shown in the following tables: 

(a) 
    Rates are for base pay only.  In addition, an amount is added to reflect target incentive compensation for exempt employees and overtime and incentive pay for nonexempt employees. 
       
  The expected return on plan assets was determined by evaluating historical returns, the current investment climate (yield on fixed income securities and other recent investment market indicators), rate of inflation and current prospects for economic growth.  The expected return on plan assets is the same for each Registrant. 
     
  The health care trend rate assumptions as of January 1 of each year used for OPEB plans measurement purposes are shown below: 

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the OPEB health care plans.  A   1%   change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: 

197 

      Significant Concentrations of Risk within Plan Assets 
    
  In addition to establishing the target asset allocation of plan assets, the investment policy also places restrictions on securities to limit significant concentrations within plan assets.  The investment policy establishes guidelines that govern maximum market exposure, security restrictions, prohibited asset classes, prohibited types of transactions, minimum credit quality, average portfolio credit quality, portfolio duration and concentration limits.  The guidelines were established to mitigate the risk of loss due to significant concentrations in any investment.  Management monitors the plans to control security diversification and ensure compliance with the investment policy.  As of December 31,   2015  , the assets were invested in compliance with all investment limits.  See  Investments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities  section of Note   1   for limit details. 
    
  Benefit Plan Obligations, Plan Assets and Funded Status as of December 31,   2015   and   2014 
    
  The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the plans  benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets and funded status as of December 31.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans  Assets 
    
  The fair value tables within Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans  Assets present the classification of assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy.  All Level 1, 2, 3 and Other amounts can be allocated to the Registrant Subsidiaries as of December 31,   2015   and   2014   using the percentages in the table below: 

205 

    The following table presents the classification of pension plan assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31,   2015  : 

(a) 
    Amounts in  Other  column primarily represent an obligation to repay collateral received as part of the Securities Lending Program. 
              (b) 
    Amounts in  Other  column primarily represent accrued interest, dividend receivables and transactions pending settlement. 
       
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of AEP s assets classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the pension assets:

(a) 
    Amounts in  Other  column primarily represent accrued interest, dividend receivables and transactions pending settlement. 
       
    Determination of Pension Expense 
    
  The determination of pension expense or income is based on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility.  This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur.  Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return. 
    
  The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans is as follows: 

209 

    For the underfunded pension plans that had an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets of these plans as of December 31,   2015   and   2014   were as follows: 

Estimated Future Benefit Payments and Contributions 
    
  The estimated pension benefit payments and contributions to the trust are at least the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act plus payment of unfunded nonqualified benefits.  For the qualified pension plan, additional discretionary contributions may also be made to maintain the funded status of the plan.   For OPEB plans, expected payments include the payment of unfunded benefits.  The following table provides the estimated contributions and payments by Registrant for   2016  : 

The tables below reflect the total benefits expected to be paid from the plan or from the Registrants  assets.  The payments include the participants  contributions to the plan for their share of the cost.  Future benefit payments are dependent on the number of employees retiring, whether the retiring employees elect to receive pension benefits as annuities or as lump sum distributions, future integration of the benefit plans with changes to Medicare and other legislation, future levels of interest rates and variances in actuarial results.  The estimated payments for the pension benefits and OPEB are as follows:

    Estimated amounts expected to be amortized to net periodic benefit costs (credits) and the impact on each Registrants  balance sheet during   2016   are shown in the following tables: 

American Electric Power System Retirement Savings Plan 
    
  AEP sponsors the American Electric Power System Retirement Savings Plan, a defined contribution retirement savings plan for substantially all employees who are not covered by a retirement savings plan of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA).  This qualified plan offers participants an opportunity to contribute a portion of their pay, includes features under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and provides for company matching contributions.  The matching contributions to the plan are   100%   of the first   1%   of eligible employee contributions and   70%   of the next   5%   of contributions. 
    
  The following table provides the cost for matching contributions to the retirement savings plans by Registrant for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  : 

213 

    UMWA Benefits (Applies to AEP and APCo) 
    
  AEP provides health and welfare benefits for certain unionized employees, retirees and their survivors who meet eligibility requirements.  APCo also provides the same UMWA health and welfare benefits for certain unionized mining retirees and their survivors who meet eligibility requirements.  UMWA trustees make final interpretive determinations with regard to all benefits.  AEP and APCo administer the health and welfare benefits and pay them from their general assets. 
    
  UMWA pension benefits are provided through the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan (Employer Identification Number: 52-1050282, Plan Number 002), a multiemployer plan.  The UMWA pension benefits are administered by a board of trustees appointed in equal numbers by the UMWA and the Bituminous Coal Operators  Association (BCOA), an industry bargaining association.  AEP makes contributions to the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan based on provisions in its labor agreement.  The UMWA pension plan is different from single-employer plans as an employer s contributions may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.  Required contributions not made by an employer may result in other employers bearing a greater amount of the unfunded plan obligations, while a withdrawing employer may be subject to a withdrawal liability.  Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), the UMWA pension plan was in Critical and Declining Status for the plan year ending June 30, 2015 and in Critical Status for the plan year ending June 30, 2014, without utilization of extended amortization provisions.  The Plan adopted a Rehabilitation Plan in February 2015, as required under the PPA.  The prior funding improvement plan is no longer in effect. 
    
  Contributions to the UMWA pension plan in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were made under a collective bargaining agreement that is set to expire December 31, 2017.  AEP contributed immaterial amounts that represent less than 5% of the total contributions in the plan s latest annual report for the years ended June 30,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  .  UMWA pension contributions included a surcharge of   5%   from December 2014 through June 2015.  Beginning July 2015, the surcharge on contributions was increased to   10%  .  Under the terms of the UMWA pension plan, contributions will be required to continue beyond the expiration of the current collective bargaining agreement, whether or not the term of that agreement is extended or a subsequent agreement is entered, so long as both the UMWA pension plan remains in effect and an AEP affiliate continues to operate the facility covered by the current collective bargaining agreement.  The contribution rate applicable would be determined by reference to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement between the UMWA and the BCOA.  If the UMWA pension plan would terminate or an AEP affiliate would cease operation of the facility without arranging for a successor operator to assume its liability, the withdrawal liability obligation would be triggered.   
    
  Based upon the plan to retrofit the Rockport Plant with dry sorbent injection technology to meet environmental emission control requirements and the timing of the closure of Cook Coal Terminal expected to be in or after 2025, AEP records a UMWA pension withdrawal liability on the balance sheet.  The UMWA pension withdrawal liability is re-measured annually and is based on the company s proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the liability balance was   $31 million   and   $40 million  , respectively.  AEP also records a related UMWA pension withdrawal regulatory asset on the balance sheet which is being recovered through billings for transloading services and should be fully collected before the planned closure.

      9  .    BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  AEP s Reportable Segments 
    
  AEP s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.  Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manage its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight.  Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. 
    
  AEP s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below: 
    
  Vertically Integrated Utilities 

Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. 
       
  Transmission and Distribution Utilities 

Transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by OPCo, TCC and TNC. 
                
    OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve SSO customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load. 
       
  AEP Transmission Holdco 

Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEP s wholly-owned transmission only subsidiaries and transmission only joint ventures.  These investments have PUCT-approved or FERC-approved returns on equity. 
       
  Generation   Marketing 

Nonregulated generation in ERCOT and PJM. 
                
    Marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO. 
       
  The remainder of AEP s activities are presented as Corporate and Other.  While not considered a reportable segment, Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries, Parent s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income and interest expense and other nonallocated costs.  With the sale of AEPRO in November 2015, the activities related to the AEP River Operations segment have been moved to Corporate and Other for the periods presented.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 

215 

      The tables below present AEP s reportable segment income statement information for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013     and reportable segment balance sheet information as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  .  These amounts include certain estimates and allocations where necessary. 

216 

217

              (f) 
    Amount includes debt related to AEPRO.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
       
  Registrant Subsidiaries  Reportable Segments 
    
  The Registrant Subsidiaries each have one reportable segment, an integrated electricity generation, transmission and distribution business, except OPCo, an electricity transmission and distribution business starting in 2014.  The Registrant Subsidiaries  other activities are insignificant.  The Registrant Subsidiaries  operations are managed on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight on the business process, cost structures and operating results. 
    218 

      10  .    DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  OBJECTIVES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
    
  AEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of AEP subsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries.  AEPEP is agent for and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries. 
    
  The Registrants are exposed to certain market risks as major power producers and participants in the electricity, capacity, natural gas, coal and emission allowance markets.  These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk.  These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact the Registrants due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates.  Management utilizes derivative instruments to manage these risks. 
    
  STRATEGIES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES 
    
  Risk Management Strategies 
    
  The strategy surrounding the use of derivative instruments primarily focuses on managing risk exposures, future cash flows and creating value utilizing both economic and formal hedging strategies.  The risk management strategies also include the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes which focus on seizing market opportunities to create value driven by expected changes in the market prices of the commodities.  To accomplish these objectives, the Registrants primarily employ risk management contracts including physical and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and options.  Not all risk management contracts meet the definition of a derivative under the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging.   Derivative risk management contracts elected normal under the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception are not subject to the requirements of this accounting guidance. 
    
  The Registrants utilize power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business.  The Registrants utilize interest rate derivative contracts in order to manage the interest rate exposure associated with the commodity portfolio.  For disclosure purposes, such risks are grouped as  Commodity,  as these risks are related to energy risk management activities.  The Registrants also utilize derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk associated with debt financing and foreign currency risk associated with future purchase obligations denominated in foreign currencies.  For disclosure purposes, these risks are grouped as  Interest Rate and Foreign Currency.   The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. 
    
    219 

      The following tables represent the gross notional volume of the Registrants  outstanding derivative contracts as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  :

Fair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Parent enters into interest rate derivative transactions as part of an overall strategy to manage the mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt.  Certain interest rate derivative transactions effectively modify exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of fixed-rate debt to a floating rate.  Provided specific criteria are met, these interest rate derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedging Strategies 
    
  The Registrants utilize cash flow hedges on certain derivative transactions for the purchase and sale of power ( Commodity ) in order to manage the variable price risk related to forecasted purchases and sales.  Management monitors the potential impacts of commodity price changes and, where appropriate, enters into derivative transactions to protect profit margins for a portion of future electricity sales and purchases.  The Registrants do not hedge all commodity price risk. 
    
  The Registrants  vehicle fleet is exposed to gasoline and diesel fuel price volatility.  The Registrants utilize financial heating oil and gasoline derivative contracts in order to mitigate price risk of future fuel purchases.  Cash flow hedge accounting for these derivative contracts was discontinued effective March 31, 2014.  The Registrants do not hedge all fuel price risk. 
    
    220 

      The Registrants utilize a variety of interest rate derivative transactions in order to manage interest rate risk exposure.  The Registrants also utilize interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate exposure related to future borrowings of fixed-rate debt.  The Registrants do not hedge all interest rate exposure. 
    
  At times, the Registrants are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks primarily when some fixed assets are purchased from foreign suppliers.  In accordance with AEP s risk management policy, the Registrants may utilize foreign currency derivative transactions to protect against the risk of increased cash outflows resulting from a foreign currency s appreciation against the dollar.  The Registrants do not hedge all foreign currency exposure. 
    
  ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
    
  The accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging  requires recognition of all qualifying derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets at fair value.  The fair values of derivative instruments accounted for using MTM accounting or hedge accounting are based on exchange prices and broker quotes.  If a quoted market price is not available, the estimate of fair value is based on the best information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes, supply and demand market data and assumptions.  In order to determine the relevant fair values of the derivative instruments, the Registrants apply valuation adjustments for discounting, liquidity and credit quality. 
    
  Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform on the contract or fail to pay amounts due.  Liquidity risk represents the risk that imperfections in the market will cause the price to vary from estimated fair value based upon prevailing market supply and demand conditions.  Since energy markets are imperfect and volatile, there are inherent risks related to the underlying assumptions in models used to fair value risk management contracts.  Unforeseen events may cause reasonable price curves to differ from actual price curves throughout a contract s term and at the time a contract settles.  Consequently, there could be significant adverse or favorable effects on future net income and cash flows if market prices are not consistent with management s estimates of current market consensus for forward prices in the current period.  This is particularly true for longer term contracts.  Cash flows may vary based on market conditions, margin requirements and the timing of settlement of risk management contracts. 
    
  According to the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging,  the Registrants reflect the fair values of derivative instruments subject to netting agreements with the same counterparty net of related cash collateral.  For certain risk management contracts, the Registrants are required to post or receive cash collateral based on third party contractual agreements and risk profiles.  For the December 31,   2015   and   2014   balance sheets, the Registrants netted cash collateral received from third parties against short-term and long-term risk management assets and cash collateral paid to third parties against short-term and long-term risk management liabilities as follows:

      Certain qualifying derivative instruments have been designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts, as provided in the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging.   Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales under that accounting guidance are not subject to MTM accounting treatment and are recognized on the statements of income on an accrual basis. 
    
  The accounting for the changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship.  Depending on the exposure, management designates a hedging instrument as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. 
    
  For contracts that have not been designated as part of a hedging relationship, the accounting for changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative instrument is held for trading purposes.  Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments held for trading purposes are included in revenues on a net basis on the statements of income.  Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments not held for trading purposes are included in revenues or expenses on the statements of income depending on the relevant facts and circumstances.  Certain derivatives that economically hedge future commodity risk are recorded in the same expense line item on the statements of income as that of the associated risk.  However, unrealized and some realized gains and losses in regulated jurisdictions for both trading and non-trading derivative instruments are recorded as regulatory assets (for losses) or regulatory liabilities (for gains) in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Regulated Operations.  
    
  In connection with OPCo s June 2012 - May 2015 ESP, the PUCO ordered OPCo to conduct energy and capacity auctions for its entire SSO load for delivery beginning in June 2015, see Note   4   - Rate Matters.  These auctions resulted in a range of products, including 12-month, 24-month, and 36-month periods.  The delivery period for each contract is scheduled to start on the first day of June of each year, immediately following the auction.  Certain affiliated Vertically Integrated Utility and Generation   Marketing segment entities participated in the auction process and were awarded tranches of OPCo s SSO load.  The underlying contracts are derivatives subject to the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging  and are accounted for using MTM accounting, unless the contract has been designated as a normal purchase or normal sale. 
    
  Accounting for Fair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP) 
    
  For fair value hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or an identified portion thereof attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item associated with the hedged risk impacts Net Income during the period of change. 
    
  AEP records realized and unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps that qualify for fair value hedge accounting treatment and any offsetting changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged in Interest Expense on the statements of income.  The following table shows the results of hedging gains (losses) during   2015  ,   2014  , and   2013  : 

For   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial. 
    
  Accounting for Cash Flow Hedging Strategies 
    
  For cash flow hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the Registrants initially report the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets until the period the hedged item affects Net Income.  The Registrants recognize any hedge ineffectiveness in Net Income immediately during the period of change, except in regulated jurisdictions where hedge ineffectiveness is recorded as a regulatory asset (for losses) or a regulatory liability (for gains). 
    229 

      Realized gains and losses on derivative contracts for the purchase and sale of power designated as cash flow hedges are included in Total Revenues or Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income or in Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the balance sheets, depending on the specific nature of the risk being hedged.  During   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , AEP applied cash flow hedging to outstanding power derivatives.  During   2015  , the Registrant Subsidiaries did not apply cash flow hedging to outstanding power derivatives.  During 2014, APCo and I M applied cash flow hedging to outstanding power derivatives.  During   2013  , APCo, I M and OPCo applied cash flow hedging to outstanding power derivatives. 
    
  The Registrants reclassify gains and losses on heating oil and gasoline derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets into Other Operation expense, Maintenance expense or Depreciation and Amortization expense, as it relates to capital projects, on the statements of income.  During   2013  , the Registrants applied cash flow hedging to outstanding heating oil and gasoline derivatives.  The impact of cash flow hedge accounting for these derivative contracts was immaterial and was discontinued effective March 31, 2014.   
    
  The Registrants reclassify gains and losses on interest rate derivative hedges related to debt financings from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets into Interest Expense on the statements of income in those periods in which hedged interest payments occur.  During   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , AEP applied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives.  During   2015   and   2014  , the Registrant Subsidiaries did not apply cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives.  During   2013  , I M applied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives. 
    
  The accumulated gains or losses related to foreign currency hedges are reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets into Depreciation and Amortization expense on the statements of income over the depreciable lives of the fixed assets designated as the hedged items in qualifying foreign currency hedging relationships.  During   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the Registrants did not apply cash flow hedging to any outstanding foreign currency derivatives. 
     
  During   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial or nonexistent for all of the hedge strategies disclosed above. 
    
  For details on effective cash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets and the reasons for changes in cash flow hedges, see Note   3  .

      Credit Risk 
    
  Management limits credit risk in marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis.  Management uses Moody s, Standard and Poor s and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial statements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis. 
    
  When management uses standardized master agreements, these agreements may include collateral requirements.  These master agreements facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty.  Cash, letters of credit and parental/affiliate guarantees may be obtained as security from counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk.  The collateral agreements require a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit in the event an exposure exceeds the established threshold.  The threshold represents an unsecured credit limit which may be supported by a parental/affiliate guaranty, as determined in accordance with AEP s credit policy.  In addition, collateral agreements allow for termination and liquidation of all positions in the event of a failure or inability to post collateral. 
    
  Collateral Triggering Events 
    
  Under the tariffs of the RTOs and Independent System Operators (ISOs) and a limited number of derivative and non-derivative contracts primarily related to competitive retail auction loads, the Registrants are obligated to post an additional amount of collateral if certain credit ratings decline below a specified rating threshold.  The amount of collateral required fluctuates based on market prices and total exposure.  On an ongoing basis, AEP s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these collateral triggering items in contracts.  The Registrants have not experienced a downgrade below a specified rating threshold that would require the posting of additional collateral.  The following tables represent the Registrants  exposure if credit ratings were to decline below a specified rating threshold as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  :

      In addition, a majority of the Registrants  non-exchange traded commodity contracts contain cross-default provisions that, if triggered, would permit the counterparty to declare a default and require settlement of the outstanding payable.  These cross-default provisions could be triggered if there was a non-performance event by Parent or the obligor under outstanding debt or a third party obligation in excess of   $50 million  .  On an ongoing basis, AEP s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these cross-default provisions in the contracts.  The following tables represent: (a) the fair value of these derivative liabilities subject to cross-default provisions prior to consideration of contractual netting arrangements, (b) the amount this exposure has been reduced by cash collateral posted by the Registrants and (c) if a cross-default provision would have been triggered, the settlement amount that would be required after considering the Registrants  contractual netting arrangements as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  :

      11  .    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements of Long-term Debt 
    
  The fair values of Long-term Debt are based on quoted market prices, without credit enhancements, for the same or similar issues and the current interest rates offered for instruments with similar maturities classified as Level 2 measurement inputs.  These instruments are not marked-to-market.  The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. 
    
  The book values and fair values of Long-term Debt for the Registrants as of December 31,   2015   and   2014   are summarized in the following table: 

(a) 
    Amount excludes   $83 million   of Long-term Debt classified as Liabilities from Discontinued Operations on the balance sheet.  See "AEPRO (Corporate and Other)" section of Note   7   for additional information. 
              (b) 
    Amount excludes   $114 million   of fair value of Long-term Debt related to AEPRO. 
       
  Fair Value Measurements of Other Temporary Investments (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Other Temporary Investments include funds held by trustees primarily for the payment of securitization bonds and securities available for sale, including marketable securities that management intends to hold for less than one year and investments by its protected cell of EIS.  See  Other Temporary Investments  section of Note   1  . 
    
  The following is a summary of Other Temporary Investments: 

234 

(a) 
     Primarily represents amounts held for the repayment of debt. 
       
  The following table provides the activity for fixed income and equity securities within Other Temporary Investments for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  : 

As of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , AEP had no Other Temporary Investments with an unrealized loss position.  As of December 31,   2015  , fixed income securities were primarily debt based mutual funds with short and intermediate maturities.  Mutual funds may be sold and do not contain maturity dates. 
    
  For details of the reasons for changes in Securities Available for Sale included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , see Note   3  . 
    
  Fair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  Securities held in trust funds for decommissioning nuclear facilities and for the disposal of SNF are recorded at fair value.  See  Nuclear Trust Funds  section of Note   1  . 
    
  The following is a summary of nuclear trust fund investments as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  : 

235 

      The following table provides the securities activity within the decommissioning and SNF trusts for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  : 

The adjusted cost of fixed income securities was   $771 million   and   $903 million   as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  The adjusted cost of equity securities was   $555 million   and   $524 million   as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    
  The fair value of fixed income securities held in the nuclear trust funds, summarized by contractual maturities, as of December 31,   2015   was as follows:

      Fair Value Measurements of Financial Assets and Liabilities 
    
  For a discussion of fair value accounting and the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy, see the  Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities  section of Note   1  . 
    
  The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Registrants  financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  .  As required by the accounting guidance for  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Management s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.  There have not been any significant changes in management s valuation techniques.

      12  .    INCOME TAXES 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  The details of the Registrants  income taxes before discontinued operations as reported are as follows: 

250 

      The following is a reconciliation for each Registrant of the difference between the amounts of federal income taxes computed by multiplying book income before income taxes by the federal statutory tax rate and the amount of income taxes reported: 

251 

252 

Net Deferred Tax Liability 
    
  The following tables show elements of the net deferred tax liability and significant temporary differences for each Registrant: 

253 

254 

AEP System Tax Allocation Agreement 
    
  AEP and subsidiaries join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return.  The allocation of the AEP System s current consolidated federal income tax to the AEP System companies allocates the benefit of current tax losses to the AEP System companies giving rise to such losses in determining their current tax expense.  The tax benefit of the Parent is allocated to its subsidiaries with taxable income.  With the exception of the loss of the Parent, the method of allocation reflects a separate return result for each company in the consolidated group. 
    
  Valuation Allowance (Applies to AEP) 
    
  AEP assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate tax character will be generated to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets.  When the evaluation of the evidence indicates that AEP will not be able to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce existing deferred tax assets to the net realizable amount.  Objective negative evidence evaluated includes whether AEP has a history of recognizing income of the character which can be offset by loss carryforwards.  Other objective negative evidence evaluated is the impact recently enacted federal tax legislation will have on future taxable income and on AEP s ability to benefit from the carryforward of charitable contribution deductions. 
    
    255 

      On the basis of this evaluation, AEP recorded a valuation allowance of   $17 million   in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the expected expiration of charitable contribution carryforward deductions and realized capital losses.  In the fourth quarter of 2015 AEP also reversed a valuation allowance originally recorded in the third quarter of 2015 of   $156 million   attributable to the unrealized capital loss associated with the excess tax basis of the stock over the book value of AEP s investment in the operations of AEPRO.  With the sale of AEPRO in the fourth quarter of 2015, AEP recorded a valuation allowance of   $48 million   attributable to realized capital losses from the sale.   
    
  A valuation allowance of   $130 million   and   $56 million   was recorded against AEP s deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The valuation allowance reflects management s assessment of the amount of its deferred tax assets that are more than likely not to be realized.  The amount of the deferred tax assets realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income are materially impacted during the carryforward period.  
    
  Federal and State Income Tax Audit Status 
    
  AEP and subsidiaries are no longer subject to U.S. federal examination for years before 2011.  The IRS examination of years 2011, 2012 and 2013 started in April 2014.  Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in management s opinion, adequate provisions for federal income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters.  In addition, the Registrants accrue interest on these uncertain tax positions.  Management is not aware of any issues for open tax years that upon final resolution are expected to materially impact net income. 
    
  AEP and subsidiaries file income tax returns in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.  These taxing authorities routinely examine their tax returns.  AEP and subsidiaries are currently under examination in several state and local jurisdictions.  However, it is possible that previously filed tax returns have positions that may be challenged by these tax authorities.  Management believes that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such challenges and that the ultimate resolution of these audits will not materially impact net income.  The Registrants are no longer subject to state, local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2009. 
    
  Net Income Tax Operating Loss Carryforward 
    
  In 2012 and 2011, AEP recognized federal net income tax operating losses of   $366 million   and   $226 million  , respectively, and in 2011, APCo and I M recognized federal net income tax operating losses of   $313 million   and   $123 million  , respectively.  The losses for AEP, APCo and I M were driven primarily by bonus depreciation, pension plan contributions and other book versus tax temporary differences.  In 2012, SWEPCo recognized federal net income tax operating losses of   $858 million   which were driven primarily by bonus depreciation.  As of December 31, 2013, AEP had   $156 million   of unrealized federal net operating loss carryforward tax benefits.  Federal taxable income was sufficient enough in 2014 that these remaining federal net income tax operating loss tax benefits were realized in full.  AEP recognized deferred state and local income tax benefits in 2012 and 2011.  AEP, APCo, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo also have state net income tax operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2015 as indicated in the table below: 

256 

      As a result, APCo, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo recognized deferred state and local income tax benefits in 2011, and/or 2012, and/or 2013, and/or 2014 and/or 2015.  At the end of 2013, APCo, I M and SWEPCo had   $12 million  ,   $13 million   and   $167 million  , respectively, of unrealized federal net operating loss carryforward.  Federal taxable income was sufficient enough in 2014 that these remaining federal net income tax operating loss tax benefits were realized in full.  Management anticipates future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the remaining state net income tax operating loss tax benefits before the state carryforward expires for each state. 
    
  As of December 31, 2013, AEP had   $121 million   of uncertain tax positions netted against the federal net income tax operating loss carryforward tax benefits.  Due to the utilization of the net operating loss carryforward in 2014,   $69 million   is presented as a non-current uncertain tax position.  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, AEP had   $59 million   and   $52 million  , respectively, of uncertain tax positions netted against deferred tax liabilities. 
    
  Tax Credit Carryforward 
    
  Federal and state net income tax operating losses sustained in 2012, 2011 and 2009 along with lower federal and state taxable income in 2010 resulted in unused federal and state income tax credits.  As of December 31, 2015, the Registrants have federal tax credit carryforwards and AEP and PSO have state tax credit carryforwards as indicated in the table below.  If these credits are not utilized, federal general business tax credits will expire in the years   2030   through   2035  . 

The Registrants anticipate future federal taxable income will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of the federal tax credits before they expire unused.  In November 2014, APCo received an order from the Virginia SCC for its 2014 Virginia Biennial Base Rate Case (see Note   4  ).  As a result of the final determination pertaining to the ability to realize future tax benefits for certain state net income tax operating loss and credit carryforwards, management determined that APCo is subject to the Virginia Minimum Tax on electric suppliers and the Virginia State Income Tax is no longer applicable.  As a result, management derecognized the related state income tax benefits, which had been subject to valuation allowances. 
    
  Uncertain Tax Positions 
    
  In May 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the U.K. Windfall Tax imposed upon U.K. electric companies privatized between 1984 and 1996 is a creditable tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  AEP filed protective claims asserting the creditability of the tax, dependent upon the outcome of the case.  As a result of the favorable U.S. Supreme Court decision, AEP recognized a tax benefit of   $80 million  , plus   $43 million   of pretax interest income in the second quarter of 2013.  The tax benefit and interest income resulted in an increase in net income of   $108 million  , but did not result in the receipt of cash as of December 31, 2015.  Due to the timing of the IRS audit cycle, receipt of cash is not expected within the next   12   months. 
    
  The Registrants recognize interest accruals related to uncertain tax positions in interest income or expense as applicable and penalties in Other Operation expense in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Income Taxes.  
    
    257 

      The following tables show amounts reported for interest expense, interest income and reversal of prior period interest expense: 

The following table shows balances for amounts accrued for the receipt of interest: 

The following table shows balances for amounts accrued for the payment of interest and penalties: 

258 

      The reconciliations of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows: 

259 

      Management believes that there will be no significant net increase or decrease in unrecognized benefits within   12   months of the reporting date.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate for each Registrant was as follows: 

Federal Tax Legislation  
    
  The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the 2012 Act) was enacted in January 2013.  Included in the 2012 Act was a one-year extension of the   50%   bonus depreciation.  The 2012 Act also retroactively extended the life of research and development, employment and several energy tax credits, which expired at the end of 2011.  The enacted provisions did not materially impact the Registrants  net income or financial condition but did have a favorable impact on cash flows in 2013. 
    
  The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (the 2014 Act) was enacted in December 2014.  Included in the 2014 Act was a one-year extension of the   50%   bonus depreciation.  The 2014 Act also retroactively extended the life of research and development, employment and several energy tax credits, which expired at the end of 2013.  The enacted provisions did not materially impact the Registrants  net income or financial condition but did have a favorable impact on cash flows in 2015. 
    
  The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH) included an extension of the   50%   bonus depreciation for three years through 2017, phasing down to   40%   in 2018 and   30%   in 2019.  PATH also provided for the extension of research and development, employment and several energy tax credits for 2015.  PATH also includes provisions to extend the wind energy production tax credit through 2016 with a three-year phase-out (2017-2019), and to extend the   30%   temporary solar investment tax credit for three years through 2019 and with a two-year phase-out (2020-2021).  PATH also provided for a permanent extension of the Research and Development tax credit.  The enacted provisions did not materially impact the Registrants  net income or financial condition but will have a favorable impact on future cash flows. 
    
  Federal Tax Regulations 
    
  In 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department issued final and re-proposed regulations regarding the deduction and capitalization of expenditures related to tangible property, effective for the tax years beginning in 2014.  In addition, the IRS issued Revenue Procedures under the Industry Issue Resolutions program that provides specific guidance for the implementation of the regulations for the electric utility industry.  These final regulations did not materially impact the Registrants  net income, cash flows or financial condition. 
    
  State Tax Legislation 
    
  Legislation was passed by the state of Indiana in May 2011 enacting a phased reduction in corporate income tax rate from   8.5%   to   6.5%  .  The   8.5%   Indiana corporate income tax rate will be reduced   0.5%   each year beginning after June 30, 2012, with the final reduction occurring in years beginning after June 30, 2015. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2013, it was determined that the state of West Virginia had achieved certain minimum levels of shortfall reserve funds.  As a result, the West Virginia corporate income tax rate was reduced from   7%   to   6.5%   in 2014.   
    
  House Bill 32 was passed by the state of Texas in June 2015, permanently reducing the Texas income/franchise tax rate from   0.95%   to   0.75%   effective January 1, 2016, applicable to reports originally due on or after the effective date.  The Texas income/franchise tax rate had been scheduled to return to   1%   in 2016.  
    
  The enacted provisions did not materially impact net income, cash flows or financial condition. 
    260 

      13  .    LEASES 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  Leases of property, plant and equipment are for remaining periods up to   34 years   and require payments of related property taxes, maintenance and operating costs.  The majority of the leases have purchase or renewal options and will be renewed or replaced by other leases. 
    
  Lease rentals for both operating and capital leases are generally charged to Other Operation and Maintenance expense in accordance with rate-making treatment for regulated operations.  Additionally, for regulated operations with capital leases, a capital lease asset and offsetting liability are recorded at the present value of the remaining lease payments for each reporting period.  Capital leases for nonregulated property are accounted for as if the assets were owned and financed.  The components of rental costs are as follows: 

(a) 
    Amounts include lease expenses related to AEPRO that have been classified as Other Operation Expense from Discontinued Operations on the statements of income in the amounts of   $89 million  ,   $96 million   and   $103 million   for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
       
    261 

      The following table shows the property, plant and equipment under capital leases and related obligations recorded on the Registrants  balance sheets.  Unless shown as a separate line on the balance sheets due to materiality, current capital lease obligations are included in Other Current Liabilities and long-term capital lease obligations are included in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Registrants  balance sheets. 

(a)  
    Amounts include Net Property Under Capital Leases that have been classified as Assets from Discontinued Operations in the amount of   $179 million   and Total Obligations Under Capital Leases that have been classified as Liabilities from Discontinued Operations in the amount of   $189 million   on the December 31, 2014 balance sheet.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
       262 

      Future minimum lease payments consisted of the following as of December 31,   2015  : 

Master Lease Agreements 
    
  The Registrants lease certain equipment under master lease agreements.  Under the lease agreements, the lessor is guaranteed a residual value up to a stated percentage of either the unamortized balance or the equipment cost at the end of the lease term.  If the actual fair value of the leased equipment is below the guaranteed residual value at the end of the lease term, the Registrants are committed to pay the difference between the actual fair value and the residual value guarantee.  Historically, at the end of the lease term the fair value has been in excess of the unamortized balance.  As of December 31,   2015  , the maximum potential loss by the Registrants for these lease agreements assuming the fair value of the equipment is zero at the end of the lease term is as follows: 

263 

      Rockport Lease (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  AEGCo and I M entered into a sale-and-leaseback transaction in 1989 with Wilmington Trust Company (Owner Trustee), an unrelated, unconsolidated trustee for Rockport Plant, Unit 2 (the Plant).  The Owner Trustee was capitalized with equity from six owner participants with no relationship to AEP or any of its subsidiaries and debt from a syndicate of banks and securities in a private placement to certain institutional investors. 
    
  The gain from the sale was deferred and is being amortized over the term of the lease, which expires in 2022.  The Owner Trustee owns the Plant and leases it equally to AEGCo and I M.  The lease is accounted for as an operating lease with the payment obligations included in the future minimum lease payments schedule earlier in this note.  The lease term is for   33 years   with potential renewal options.  At the end of the lease term, AEGCo and I M have the option to renew the lease or the Owner Trustee can sell the Plant.  AEP, AEGCo and I M have no ownership interest in the Owner Trustee and do not guarantee its debt.  The future minimum lease payments for this sale-and-leaseback transaction as of December 31,   2015   are as follows: 

(a)    AEP s future minimum lease payments includes equal shares from AEGCo and I M. 

Railcar Lease (Applies to AEP, I M and SWEPCo) 
    
  In June 2003, AEP Transportation LLC (AEP Transportation), a subsidiary of AEP, entered into an agreement with BTM Capital Corporation, as lessor, to lease 875 coal-transporting aluminum railcars.  The lease is accounted for as an operating lease.  In January 2008, AEP Transportation assigned the remaining 848 railcars under the original lease agreement to I M (390 railcars) and SWEPCo (458 railcars).  The assignment is accounted for as operating leases for I M and SWEPCo.  The initial lease term was five years with three consecutive five-year renewal periods for a maximum lease term of twenty years.  I M and SWEPCo intend to renew these leases for the full lease term of twenty years via the renewal options.  The future minimum lease obligations are   $10 million   and   $11 million   for I M and SWEPCo, respectively, for the remaining railcars as of December 31,   2015  .  These obligations are included in the future minimum lease payments schedule earlier in this note. 
    
  Under the lease agreement, the lessor is guaranteed that the sale proceeds under a return-and-sale option will equal at least a lessee obligation amount specified in the lease, which declines from   83%   of the projected fair value of the equipment under the current five-year lease term to   77%   at the end of the 20-year term.  I M and SWEPCo have assumed the guarantee under the return-and-sale option.  The maximum potential losses related to the guarantee are   $9 million   and   $10 million   for I M and SWEPCo, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, assuming the fair value of the equipment is zero at the end of the current five-year lease term.  However, management believes that the fair value would produce a sufficient sales price to avoid any loss. 
    
  AEPRO Boat and Barge Leases (Applies to AEP) 
    
  In October 2015, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in November 2015.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7  .  Certain of the boat and barge leases acquired by the nonaffiliated party are subject to an AEP guarantee in favor of the lessor, ensuring future payments under such leases with maturities up to 2026.  As of December 31, 2015,  
    264 

      the maximum potential amount of future payments required under the guaranteed leases was   $94 million  .  In certain instances, AEP has no recourse against the nonaffiliated party if required to pay a lessor under a guarantee, but AEP would have access to sell the leased assets in order to recover payments made by AEP under the guarantee.  As of December 31, 2015, AEP s boat and barge lease guarantee liability was   $16 million  . 
    
  Sabine Dragline Lease (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
    
  During 2009, Sabine entered into capital lease arrangements with a nonaffiliated company to finance the purchase of two electric draglines to be used for Sabine s mining operations totaling   $47 million  .  The amounts included in the lease represented the aggregate fair value of the existing equipment and a sale-and-leaseback transaction for additional dragline rebuild costs required to keep the dragline operational.  These capital lease assets are included in Other Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets.  The short-term and long-term capital lease obligations are included in Other Current Liabilities and Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on AEP s balance sheets and in Obligations Under Capital Leases on SWEPCo s balance sheets.  The future payment obligations are included in SWEPCo s future minimum lease payments schedule earlier in this note. 
    
  I M Nuclear Fuel Lease (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  In November 2013, I M entered into a sale-and-leaseback transaction with IMP 11-2013, a nonaffiliated Ohio trust, to lease nuclear fuel for I M s Cook Plant.  In November 2013, I M sold a portion of its unamortized nuclear fuel inventory to the trust for   $110 million  .  The lease has a variable rate based on one month LIBOR and is accounted for as a capital lease with lease terms up to   54 months  .  The future payment obligations of   $35 million   are included in I M s future minimum lease payments schedule earlier in this note.  The net capital lease asset is included in Other Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets.  The short-term capital lease obligations are included in Other Current Liabilities on AEP s balance sheets and in Obligations Under Capital Leases on I M s balance sheets.  The long-term capital lease obligations are included in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets.  The future minimum lease payments for the sale-and-leaseback transaction as of December 31,   2015   are as follows, based on estimated fuel burn:

267 

               (a) 
    For certain series of pollution control bonds, interest rates are subject to periodic adjustment.  Certain series may be purchased on demand at periodic interest adjustment dates.  Letters of credit from banks and insurance policies support certain series. 
              (b) 
    Certain pollution control bonds are subject to redemption earlier than the maturity date.  Consequently, these bonds have been classified for maturity purposes as Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets. 
              (c) 
    Notes payable represent outstanding promissory notes issued under term loan agreements and credit agreements with a number of banks and other financial institutions.  At expiration, all notes then issued and outstanding are due and payable.  Interest rates are both fixed and variable.  Variable rates generally relate to specified short-term interest rates. 
              (d) 
    Amount excludes $83 million of Long-term Debt classified as Liabilities from Discontinued Operations on the balance sheet.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information.

  Dividend Restrictions 
    
  Parent Restrictions (Applies to AEP) 
    
  The holders of AEP s common stock are entitled to receive the dividends declared by the Board of Directors provided funds are legally available for such dividends.  Parent s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries. 
    
  Pursuant to the leverage restrictions in credit agreements, AEP must maintain a percentage of debt to total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%.  The payment of cash dividends indirectly results in an increase in the percentage of debt to total capitalization of the company distributing the dividend.  The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually defined in the credit agreements.  As of December 31,   2015  , none of AEP s retained earnings were restricted for the purpose of the payment of dividends. 
    268 

      Utility Subsidiaries  Restrictions 
    
  AEP utility subsidiaries pay dividends to Parent provided funds are legally available.  Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends.   
    
  Certain AEP subsidiaries have credit agreements that contain a covenant that limits their debt to capitalization ratio to 67.5%.  As of December 31,   2015  , the amount of restricted net assets of AEP s subsidiaries that may not be distributed to Parent in the form of a loan, advance or dividend was   $8.1 billion  .  As of December 31,   2015  , none of APCo s retained earnings had restrictions related to the payment of dividends to Parent, while   $92 million  ,   $105 million   and   $354 million   of I M s, PSO s and SWEPCo s retained earnings, respectively, had restrictions related to the payment of dividends to Parent. 
    
  The Federal Power Act prohibits the utility subsidiaries from participating  in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.   As of December 31,   2015  , this restriction did not limit the ability of the utility subsidiaries to pay dividends out of retained earnings. 
    
  Additionally, the Federal Power Act creates a reserve on earnings attributable to hydroelectric generation plants.  Because of their ownership of such plants, this reserve applies to AGR, APCo and I M. 
    
  Lines of Credit and Short-term Debt (Applies to AEP) 
    
  AEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries.  The program is used to fund both a Utility Money Pool, which funds the utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain of the nonutility subsidiaries.  In addition, the program also funds, as direct borrowers, the short-term debt requirements of other subsidiaries that are not participants in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons.  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP had credit facilities totaling   $3.5 billion   to support its commercial paper program.  The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during   2015   was   $788 million   and the weighted average interest rate of commercial paper outstanding during   2015   was   0.46%  .  AEP s outstanding short-term debt was as follows: 

(a) 
    Weighted average rate. 
              (b) 
    Amount of securitized debt for receivables as accounted for under the  Transfers and Servicing  accounting guidance.

      Corporate Borrowing Program   AEP System (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries) 
    
  The AEP System uses a corporate borrowing program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of AEP s subsidiaries.  The corporate borrowing program includes a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP s utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries.  The AEP System Utility Money Pool operates in accordance with the terms and conditions of the AEP System Utility Money Pool agreement filed with the FERC.   The amounts of outstanding loans to (borrowings from) the Utility Money Pool as of December 31,   2015   and   2014   are included in Advances to Affiliates and Advances from Affiliates, respectively, on each of the Registrant Subsidiaries  balance sheets.  The Utility Money Pool participants  money pool activity and their corresponding authorized borrowing limits for the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014   are described in the following tables:

  For a discussion of credit facilities, see  Letters of Credit  section of Note   6  . 
    
  Sale of Receivables   AEP Credit (Applies to AEP) 
    
  AEP Credit has a receivables securitization agreement with bank conduits.  Under the securitization agreement, AEP Credit receives financing from the bank conduits for the interest in the receivables AEP Credit acquires from affiliated utility subsidiaries.  These securitized transactions allow AEP Credit to repay its outstanding debt obligations, continue to purchase the operating companies  receivables and accelerate AEP Credit s cash collections. 
    
  AEP Credit s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of   $750 million   from bank conduits to purchase receivables.  The agreement was increased in June 2014 from   $700 million   and expires in June 2017. 
    
  Accounts receivable information for AEP Credit is as follows: 

AEP Credit s delinquent customer accounts receivable represent accounts greater than 30 days past due. 
    
    272 

      Sale of Receivables   AEP Credit (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries) 
    
  Under this sale of receivables arrangement, the Registrant Subsidiaries sell, without recourse, certain of their customer accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenue balances to AEP Credit and are charged a fee based on AEP Credit s financing costs, administrative costs and uncollectible accounts experience for each Registrant Subsidiary s receivables.  APCo does not have regulatory authority to sell its West Virginia accounts receivable.  The costs of customer accounts receivable sold are reported in Other Operation expense on the Registrant Subsidiaries  statements of income.  The Registrant Subsidiaries manage and service their customer accounts receivable, which are sold to AEP Credit.  AEP Credit securitizes the eligible receivables for the operating companies and retains the remainder. 
    
  The amount of accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues under the sale of receivables agreement for each Registrant Subsidiary as of December 31,   2015   and   2014   was as follows: 

The fees paid by the Registrant Subsidiaries to AEP Credit for customer accounts receivable sold were: 

The Registrant Subsidiaries  proceeds on the sale of receivables to AEP Credit were:

      15  .    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to AEP only.  The impact of AEP s share-based compensation plans is insignificant to the financial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries.  
    
  AEP s long-term incentive plan available for eligible employees and directors, the Amended and Restated American Electric Power System Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Prior Plan ), was replaced prospectively for new grants by the American Electric Power System 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2015 LTIP ) effective in April 2015.  The 2015 LTIP provides for a maximum of   10   million common shares to be available for grant to eligible employees and directors.  As of December 31,   2015  ,   9,964,153   shares remained available for issuance under the 2015 LTIP plan. No new awards may be granted under the Prior Plan.  To the extent the issuance of a share that is subject to an outstanding award under the Prior Plan, the issuance of that share will take place under the Prior Plan. The 2015 LTIP awards may be stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance share units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. If a share is issued pursuant to a stock option or a stock appreciation right, it will reduce the aggregate amount authorized under the 2015 LTIP by   0.286   of a share. If a share is issued for any other award, it will reduce the aggregate amount authorized under the 2015 LTIP by one share.  The following sections provide further information regarding each type of stock-based compensation award granted by the Human Resources Committee of AEP s Board of Directors (HR Committee). 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  AEP did not grant stock options in   2015  ,   2014   or   2013  . AEP did have outstanding stock options from grants in earlier periods that were exercised in 2013.  As of December 31,   2015  , AEP has no outstanding stock options.  AEP recorded compensation cost for stock options over the vesting period based on the fair value on the grant date.  The 2015 LTIP specifies a maximum contractual term of   10 years   for stock options. 
    
  The total intrinsic value of options exercised is as follows: 

(a) 
    Intrinsic value is calculated as market price at exercise dates less the option exercise price. 
       
  A summary of AEP stock option transactions during the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   is as follows: 

AEP includes the proceeds received from exercised stock options in common stock and paid-in capital. 
    
    274 

      Performance Units 
    
  Pursuant to the 2015 LTIP, AEP s performance units are paid out in cash rather than AEP shares.  For that reason, AEP s performance units no longer reduce the aggregate share authorization.  AEP s performance units have a fair value upon vesting equal to the average closing market price of AEP common stock for the last   20   trading days of the performance period.  The number of performance units held at the end of the   three   year performance period is multiplied by the performance score to determine the actual number of performance units realized.  The performance score can range from   0%   to   200%   and is determined at the end of the performance period based on performance measures, which include both performance and market conditions, established for each grant at the beginning of the performance period by the HR Committee.  Certain employees must satisfy stock ownership requirements.  If those employees have not met their stock ownership requirements, their performance units are mandatorily deferred as AEP career shares.  AEP career shares are a form of non-qualified deferred compensation that has a value equivalent to shares of AEP common stock.  AEP career shares are paid in cash after the participant s termination of employment.  Amounts equivalent to cash dividends on both performance units and AEP career shares accrue as additional units.  Management records compensation cost for performance units over a three-year vesting period.  The liability for both the performance units and AEP career shares, recorded in Employee Benefits and Pension Obligations on the balance sheets, is adjusted for changes in value.  
    
  The HR Committee awarded performance units and reinvested dividends on outstanding performance units and AEP career shares for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   as follows: 

(a) 
    The vesting period for the reinvested dividends on performance units is equal to the remaining life of the related performance units.  Dividends on AEP career shares vest immediately when the dividend is awarded but are not paid in cash until after the participant s employment ends. 
       
  Performance scores and final awards are determined and certified by the HR Committee in accordance with the pre-established performance measures within approximately a month after the end of the performance period.  The performance scores for all open performance periods are dependent on   two   equally-weighted performance measures: (a)   three  -year total shareholder return measured relative to the Standard and Poor s 500 Electric Utilities Index and (b)   three  -year cumulative earnings per share measured relative to a target approved by AEP s Board of Directors. 
    
  The certified performance scores and units earned for the three-year periods ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were as follows:  

275 

      The cash payouts for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were as follows: 

Restricted Stock Units 
    
  The HR Committee grants restricted stock units (RSUs), which generally vest, subject to the participant s continued employment, over at least   three   years in approximately equal annual increments.  The RSUs accrue dividends.  Additional RSUs granted as dividends vest on the same date as the underlying RSUs.  RSUs are converted into a share of AEP common stock upon vesting, except for AEP s officers subject to the disclosure requirements set forth in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, who are paid in cash.  In 2014, there were no RSUs granted to Section 16 officers due to a change that deferred granting these and other awards until February 2015.  For RSUs paid in shares, compensation cost is measured at fair value on the grant date and recorded over the vesting period.  Fair value is determined by multiplying the number of RSUs granted by the grant date market closing price.  For RSUs paid in cash, compensation cost is recorded over the vesting period and adjusted for changes in fair value until vested.  The fair value at vesting is determined by multiplying the number of RSUs vested by the   20  -day average closing price of AEP common stock.  The maximum contractual term of outstanding RSUs is approximately   40 months   from the grant date. 
    
  In 2010, the HR Committee granted a total of   165,520   RSUs to four Chief Executive Officer succession candidates as a retention incentive for these candidates.  These grants vested in three approximately equal installments on August 3, 2013, August 3, 2014 and August 3, 2015.   
    
  The HR Committee awarded RSUs, including additional units awarded as dividends, for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   as follows: 

The total fair value and total intrinsic value of restricted stock units vested during the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were as follows: 

(a) 
    Intrinsic value is calculated as market price at exercise date. 
       
    276 

      A summary of the status of AEP s nonvested RSUs as of December 31,   2015   and changes during the year ended December 31,   2015   are as follows: 

The total aggregate intrinsic value of nonvested RSUs as of December 31,   2015   was   $41 million   and the weighted average remaining contractual life was   1.9 years  . 
    
  Other Stock-Based Plans 
    
  AEP also has a Stock Unit Accumulation Plan for Non-Employee Directors providing each non-employee director with AEP stock units as a substantial portion of their quarterly compensation for their services as a director.  The number of stock units provided is based on the closing price of AEP common stock on the last trading day of the quarter for which the stock units were earned.  Amounts equivalent to cash dividends on the stock units accrue as additional AEP stock units.  The stock units granted to Non-Employee Directors are fully vested upon grant date.  Stock units are paid in cash upon termination of board service or up to   10 years   later if the participant so elects.  Cash payments for stock units are calculated based on the average closing price of AEP common stock for the last   20   trading days prior to the distribution date.  After five years of service on the Board of Directors, non-employee directors receive contributions to an AEP stock fund awarded under the Stock Unit Accumulation Plan. 
    
  Management records compensation cost for stock units when the units are awarded and adjusts the liability for changes in value based on the current   20  -day average closing price of AEP common stock on the valuation date. 
    
  The cash payouts for stock unit distributions for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were   $1 million  ,   $5 million   and   $2 million  , respectively.  
    
  The Board of Directors awarded stock units, including units awarded for dividends, for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   as follows: 

277 

      Share-based Compensation Plans 
    
  Compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements, the actual tax benefit realized from the tax deductions for compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements recognized in income and total compensation cost capitalized in relation to the cost of an asset for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were as follows: 

(a) 
    Compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements is included in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses on the statements of income. 
       
  During the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , there were no significant modifications affecting any of the AEP s share-based payment arrangements. 
    
  As of December 31,   2015  , there was   $72 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2015 LTIP and Prior Plan.  Unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based arrangements will change as the fair value of performance units and AEP career shares is adjusted each period and as forfeitures for all award types are realized.  AEP s unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.4 years  . 
    
  Cash received from stock options exercised and actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from stock options exercised during the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were as follows: 

AEP s practice is to use authorized but unissued shares to fulfill share commitments for stock option exercises and RSU vesting.  Although management does not currently anticipate any changes to this practice, management is permitted to use treasury shares, shares acquired in the open market specifically for distribution under the 2015 LTIP and Prior Plan or any combination thereof for this purpose.  The number of new shares issued to fulfill vesting RSUs is generally reduced to offset AEP s tax withholding obligation.

  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrant Subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  For other related party transactions, also see  AEP System Tax Allocation Agreement  section of Note   12   in addition to  Utility Money Pool   AEP System  and  Sale of Receivables   AEP Credit  sections of Note   14  . 
    
  Interconnection Agreement 
    
  In accordance with management s December 2010 announcement and October 2012 filing with the FERC, the Interconnection Agreement was terminated effective January 1, 2014.  The AEP System Interim Allowance Agreement which provided for, among other things, the transfer of SO   2    emission allowances associated with transactions under the Interconnection Agreement was also terminated. 
    
  APCo, I M, KPCo, OPCo and AEPSC were parties to the Interconnection Agreement which defined the sharing of costs and benefits associated with the respective generation plants.  This sharing was based upon each AEP utility subsidiary s MLR and was calculated monthly on the basis of each AEP utility subsidiary s maximum peak demand in relation to the sum of the maximum peak demands of all four AEP utility subsidiaries during the preceding 12 months. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2014, the FERC approved the following agreements.  See  Corporate Separation  section of Note   1  . 

A Power Coordination Agreement (PCA) among APCo, I M and KPCo with AEPSC as the agent to coordinate the participants  respective power supply resources.  Effective May 2015, the PCA was revised and approved by the FERC to include WPCo. 
                
    A Bridge Agreement among AGR, APCo, I M, KPCo and OPCo with AEPSC as the agent to address open commitments related to the termination of the Interconnection Agreement and responsibilities to PJM. 
                
    A Power Supply Agreement between AGR and OPCo for AGR to supply capacity and the energy needs of OPCo s retail load. 
       
  AEPSC conducts power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other risk management activities on behalf of APCo, I M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.  Effective January 1, 2014 and revised in May 2015, power and natural gas risk management activities for APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo are allocated based on the four member companies  respective equity positions, while power and natural gas risk management activities for PSO and SWEPCo are allocated based on the Operating Agreement.  Prior to January 1, 2014, power and natural gas risk management activities were allocated under the SIA to former members of the Interconnection Agreement, PSO and SWEPCo.  Risk management activities primarily include power and natural gas physical transactions, financially-settled swaps and exchange-traded futures.  AEPSC settles the majority of the physical forward contracts by entering into offsetting contracts.  Effective January 1, 2014 and with the transfer of OPCo s generation assets to AGR, AEPSC conducts only gasoline, diesel fuel, energy procurement and risk management activities on OPCo s behalf. 
    
  Operating Agreement (Applies to PSO and SWEPCo) 
    
  PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the Operating Agreement which was approved by the FERC.  The Operating Agreement requires PSO and SWEPCo to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires that capacity in excess of the required margins be made available for sale to other operating companies as capacity commitments.  In January 2014, the FERC approved a modification of the Operating Agreement to address changes resulting from an anticipated March 2014 SPP power market change.  Subsequently and in March 2014, SPP changed from an energy imbalance service market to a fully integrated power market.  In alignment with the new SPP integrated power market and according to the modified Operating Agreement, PSO and SWEPCo operate as standalone entities and offer their respective generation into the SPP power market.  SPP then economically dispatches resources.  By offering their resources separately, PSO and SWEPCo no longer purchase or sell energy to each other to serve their respective internal load or off-system sales.

  Under the SIA, AEPSC allocates physical and financial revenues and expenses from transactions with neighboring utilities, power marketers and other power and natural gas risk management activities based upon the location of such activity.  Margins resulting from trading and marketing activities originating in PJM and MISO generally accrue to the benefit of APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo, while trading and marketing activities originating in SPP generally accrue to the benefit of PSO and SWEPCo.  Margins resulting from other transactions are allocated among APCo, I M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo based upon the equity positions of these companies. 
    
  The SIA was designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the Interconnection Agreement (prior to January 1, 2014) and the Operating Agreement, each of which controlled the distribution of revenues and expenses. 
    
  Affiliated Revenues and Purchases 
    
  The following tables show the revenues derived from sales under the Interconnection Agreement, direct sales to affiliates, net transmission agreement sales and other revenues for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  : 

(a)    Refer to the Ohio Auctions section below for further information regarding these amounts. 
  (b)    Includes December 2013 true-up activity subsequent to agreement termination.

      The following tables show the purchased power expenses incurred for purchases under the Interconnection Agreement and from affiliates for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  : 

(a)    Refer to the Ohio Auctions section below for further information regarding this amount. 
  (b)    Includes December 2013 true-up activity subsequent to agreement termination. 
    
  The above summarized related party revenues and expenses are reported in Sales to AEP Affiliates and Purchased Electricity from AEP Affiliates, respectively, on the Registrant Subsidiaries  statements of income.  Since the Registrant Subsidiaries are included in AEP s consolidated results, the above summarized related party transactions are eliminated in total in AEP s consolidated revenues and expenses. 
    
  System Transmission Integration Agreement (STIA) 
    
  AEP s STIA provided for the integration and coordination of the planning, operation and maintenance of transmission facilities.  Since the FERC approved the cancellation of the STIA effective June 1, 2014, the coordinated planning, operation and maintenance of transmission facilities are the responsibility of the RTOs and the STIA is no longer necessary.  Similar to the SIA, the STIA functioned as an umbrella agreement in addition to the Transmission Agreement (TA) and the Transmission Coordination Agreement (TCA).  The TA and TCA are both still active.  The STIA contained two service schedules that governed: 

The allocation of transmission costs and revenues. 
                
    The allocation of third-party transmission costs and revenues and AEP System dispatch costs. 
       
    281 

      APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo, OPCo and WPCo are parties to the TA, effective November 2010, which defines how transmission costs through PJM OATT are allocated among the AEP East Companies, KGPCo and WPCo on a 12-month average coincident peak basis. 
    
  The following table shows the net charges recorded by the Registrant Subsidiaries for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   related to the TA: 

The charges shown above are recorded in Other Operation expenses on the statements of income. 
    
  PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA, dated January 1, 1997, by and among PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC, in connection with the operation of the transmission assets of the two AEP utility subsidiaries.  The TCA has been approved by the FERC and establishes a coordinating committee, which is charged with overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement.  This includes the performance of transmission planning studies, the interaction of such companies with independent system operators (ISO) and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and compliance with the terms of the OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such a tariff. 
    
  Under the TCA, the parties to the agreement delegated to AEPSC the responsibility of monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on their behalf.  The allocations have been governed by the FERC-approved OATT for the SPP. 
    
  The following table shows the net (revenues) expenses allocated among parties to the TCA pursuant to the SPP OATT protocols as described above for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  : 

The net (revenues) expenses shown above are recorded in Sales to AEP Affiliates on SWEPCo s statements of income and Other Operation expenses on PSO s statements of income. 
    
  Ohio Auctions (Applies to APCo, I M and OPCo) 
    
  In connection with OPCo s June 2012 - May 2015 ESP, the PUCO ordered OPCo to conduct energy and capacity auctions for its entire SSO load for delivery beginning in June 2015.  AEPEP, APCo, KPCo, I M and WPCo participated in the auction process and were awarded tranches of OPCo s SSO load.

      Unit Power Agreements (UPA) (Applies to I M and OPCo) 
    
  Lawrenceburg UPA 
    
  In March 2007, OPCo and AEGCo entered into a 10-year UPA for the entire output from the Lawrenceburg Generating Station effective with AEGCo s purchase of the plant in May 2007.  Effective January 1, 2014, the Lawrenceburg UPA was assigned by OPCo to AGR.  AGR has an option to extend the UPA for an additional two years.  I M operates the plant under an agreement with AEGCo.  Under the UPA, AGR pays AEGCo for the capacity, depreciation, fuel, operation and maintenance and tax expenses.  These payments are due regardless of whether the plant is operating.  The fuel and operation and maintenance payments are based on actual costs incurred.  All expenses are trued up periodically. 
    
  UPA between AEGCo and I M 
    
  A UPA between AEGCo and I M (the I M Power Agreement) provides for the sale by AEGCo to I M of all the power (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant unless it is sold to another utility.  Subsequently, I M assigns   30%   of the power to KPCo.  See the  UPA between AEGCo and KPCo  section below.  I M is obligated, whether or not power is available from AEGCo, to pay as a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and as an energy charge for any associated energy taken by I M) net of amounts received by AEGCo from any other sources, sufficient to enable AEGCo to pay all its operating and other expenses, including a rate of return on the common equity of AEGCo as approved by the FERC.  The I M Power Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the lease term of Unit 2 of the Rockport Plant unless extended in specified circumstances. 
    
  UPA between AEGCo and KPCo 
    
  Pursuant to an assignment between I M and KPCo and a UPA between KPCo and AEGCo, AEGCo sells KPCo   30%   of the power (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant.  KPCo pays to AEGCo in consideration for the right to receive such power the same amounts which I M would have paid AEGCo under the terms of the I M Power Agreement for such entitlement.  The KPCo UPA ends in December 2022. 
    
  Cook Coal Terminal (Applies to I M, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo) 
    
  On August 1, 2013, OPCo transferred its interest in Cook Coal Terminal to AEGCo.  Cook Coal Terminal performs coal transloading and storage services at cost for I M and OPCo.  OPCo included revenues for these services in Other Revenues   Affiliated and expenses in Other Operation expenses on the statements of income.  The coal transloading expenses in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were as follows:

I M recorded revenues from barging, transloading and other services in Other Revenues   Affiliated on the statements of income.  The affiliated companies recorded these costs paid to I M as fuel expenses or other operation expenses.  The amounts of affiliated expenses were: 

284 

      Services Provided by AEP River Operations LLC (Applies to I M) 
    
  AEP River Operations LLC provided services for barge towing, chartering and general and administrative expenses to I M.  The costs are recorded by I M as Other Operation expenses.  In October 2015, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell AEP River Operations LLC to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in November 2015.  For the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , I M recorded expenses of   $19 million  ,   $24 million   and   $24 million  , respectively, for these activities. 
    
  Central Machine Shop 
    
  APCo operates a facility which repairs and rebuilds specialized components for the generation plants across the AEP System.  APCo defers the cost of performing these services on the balance sheet, then transfers the cost to the affiliate for reimbursement.  The AEP subsidiaries recorded these billings as capital or maintenance expenses depending on the nature of the services received.  These billings are recoverable from customers.  The following table provides the amounts billed by APCo to the following affiliates: 

Affiliate Railcar Agreement (Applies to APCo, I M, PSO and SWEPCo) 
    
  Certain AEP subsidiaries have an agreement providing for the use of each other s leased or owned railcars when available.  The agreement specifies that the company using the railcar will be billed, at cost, by the company furnishing the railcar.  The AEP subsidiaries recorded these costs or reimbursements as costs or reduction of costs, respectively, in Fuel on the balance sheets and such costs are recoverable from customers.  The following tables show the net effect of the railcar agreement on the balance sheets: 

285 

      OVEC (Applies to APCo, I M and OPCo) 
    
  AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC.  As of December 31,   2015  , the ownership and investment in OVEC were as follows: 

OVEC s owners, along with APCo and I M, are members to an intercompany power agreement.  Participants of this agreement are entitled to receive and obligated to pay for all OVEC generating capacity, approximately   2,400   MWs, in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of certain AEP utility subsidiaries, including APCo, I M and OPCo, is   43.47%  .  The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and provide a return on capital.  The intercompany power agreement ends in June 2040. 
    
  AEP and other nonaffiliated owners authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests.  OVEC financed capital expenditures totaling   $1.3 billion   in connection with the engineering and construction of FGD projects and the associated waste disposal landfills at its   two   generation plants.  These environmental projects were funded through debt issuances.  As of December 31,   2015  , both generation plants were operating with environmental controls. 
    
  Purchased Power from OVEC 
    
  The amounts of power purchased by the Registrant Subsidiaries from OVEC for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were:

The billings for services are made at cost and include no compensation for the use of equity capital. 
    287 

      17  .    VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.  
    
  The accounting guidance for  Variable Interest Entities  is a consolidation model that considers if a company has a controlling financial interest in a VIE.  A controlling financial interest will have both (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  Entities are required to consolidate a VIE when it is determined that they have a controlling financial interest in a VIE and therefore, are the primary beneficiary of that VIE, as defined by the accounting guidance for  Variable Interest Entities.   In determining whether AEP is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management considers factors such as equity at risk, the amount of the VIE s variability AEP absorbs, guarantees of indebtedness, voting rights including kick-out rights, the power to direct the VIE, variable interests held by related parties and other factors.  Management believes that significant assumptions and judgments were applied consistently.  
    
  AEP is the primary beneficiary of Sabine, DCC Fuel, Transition Funding, Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding, Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding, AEP Credit, a protected cell of EIS and Transource Energy.  In addition, AEP has not provided material financial or other support to any of these entities that was not previously contractually required.  AEP holds a significant variable interest in DHLC and Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline, LLC West Virginia Series (West Virginia Series).  
    
  Consolidated Variable Interests Entities 
    
  Sabine is a mining operator providing mining services to SWEPCo.  SWEPCo has no equity investment in Sabine but is Sabine s only customer.  SWEPCo guarantees the debt obligations and lease obligations of Sabine.  Under the terms of the note agreements, substantially all assets are pledged and all rights under the lignite mining agreement are assigned to SWEPCo.  The creditors of Sabine have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo.  Under the provisions of the mining agreement, SWEPCo is required to pay, as a part of the cost of lignite delivered, an amount equal to mining costs plus a management fee.  In addition, SWEPCo determines how much coal will be mined each year.  Based on these facts, management concluded that SWEPCo is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate Sabine.  SWEPCo s total billings from Sabine for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were   $152 million  ,   $151 million   and   $155 million  , respectively.  See the table below for the classification of Sabine s assets and liabilities on SWEPCo s balance sheets. 
    
  I M has nuclear fuel lease agreements with DCC Fuel, which was formed for the purpose of acquiring, owning and leasing nuclear fuel to I M.  DCC Fuel purchased the nuclear fuel from I M with funds received from the issuance of notes to financial institutions.  Each DCC Fuel entity is a single-lessee leasing arrangement with only one asset and is capitalized with all debt.  Each is a separate legal entity from I M, the assets of which are not available to satisfy the debts of I M.  Payments on the leases for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were   $115 million  ,   $109 million   and   $153 million  , respectively.  The leases were recorded as capital leases on I M s balance sheet as title to the nuclear fuel transfers to I M at the end of the respective lease terms, which do not exceed 54 months.  Based on I M s control of DCC Fuel, management concluded that I M is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate DCC Fuel.  The capital leases are eliminated upon consolidation.  See the table below for the classification of DCC Fuel s assets and liabilities on I M s balance sheets. 
    
  Transition Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to Texas Restructuring Legislation.  Management has concluded that TCC is the primary beneficiary of Transition Funding because TCC has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and TCC s equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, TCC is required to consolidate Transition Funding.  The securitized bonds totaled   $1.5 billion   and   $1.8 billion   as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, and are included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated and Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets.  Transition Funding has securitized transition assets of   $1.3 billion   and   $1.6 billion   as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets.  The securitized transition assets represent the right to impose and collect  
    288 

      Texas true-up costs from customers receiving electric transmission or distribution service from TCC under recovery mechanisms approved by the PUCT.  The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized transition assets.  The bondholders have no recourse to TCC or any other AEP entity.  TCC acts as the servicer for Transition Funding s securitized transition assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Transition Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs.  See the tables below for the classification of Transition Funding s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.  
    
  Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to phase-in recovery property.  Management has concluded that OPCo is the primary beneficiary of Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding because OPCo has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and OPCo s equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, OPCo is required to consolidate Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding.  The securitized bonds totaled   $185 million   and   $230 million   as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, and are included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated and Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets. Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding has securitized assets of   $86 million   and   $110 million   as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets.  The phase-in recovery property represents the right to impose and collect Ohio deferred distribution charges from customers receiving electric transmission and distribution service from OPCo under a recovery mechanism approved by the PUCO.  In August 2013, securitization bonds were issued.  The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets.  The bondholders have no recourse to OPCo or any other AEP entity.  OPCo acts as the servicer for Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding s securitized assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs.  See the table below for the classification of Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding s assets and liabilities on OPCo s balance sheets.  
    
  Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to APCo s under-recovered ENEC deferral balance.  Management has concluded that APCo is the primary beneficiary of Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding because APCo has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and APCo s equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, APCo is required to consolidate Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding.  The securitized bonds totaled   $342 million   and   $364 million   as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, and are included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated and Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets.  Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding has securitized assets of   $328 million   and   $350 million   as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets.  The phase-in recovery property represents the right to impose and collect West Virginia deferred generation charges from customers receiving electric transmission, distribution and generation service from APCo under a recovery mechanism approved by the WVPSC.  In November 2013, securitization bonds were issued.  The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets.  The bondholders have no recourse to APCo or any other AEP entity.  APCo acts as the servicer for Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding s securitized assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs.  See the table below for the classification of Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding s assets and liabilities on APCo s balance sheets.  
    
  AEP Credit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.  AEP Credit purchases, without recourse, accounts receivable from certain utility subsidiaries of AEP to reduce working capital requirements.  AEP provides a minimum of   5%   equity and up to   20%   of AEP Credit s short-term borrowing needs in excess of third party financings.  Any third party financing of AEP Credit only has recourse to the receivables securitized for such financing.  Based on AEP s control of AEP Credit, management concluded that AEP is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate AEP Credit.  See the tables below for the classification of AEP Credit s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.  See  Securitized Accounts Receivables - AEP Credit  section of Note   14  . 
    
  AEP s subsidiaries participate in one protected cell of EIS for approximately ten lines of insurance.  EIS has multiple protected cells.  Neither AEP nor its subsidiaries have an equity investment in EIS.  The AEP System is essentially this EIS cell s only participant, but allows certain third parties access to this insurance.  AEP s subsidiaries and any allowed third parties share in the insurance coverage, premiums and risk of loss from claims.  Based on AEP s control and the  
    289 

      structure of the protected cell of EIS, management concluded that AEP is the primary beneficiary of the protected cell and are required to consolidate the protected cell of EIS.  The insurance premium expense to the protected cell for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were   $29 million  ,   $32 million   and   $31 million  , respectively.  See the tables below for the classification of the protected cell s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets. 
    
  Transource Energy was formed for the purpose of investing in utilities which develop, acquire, construct, own and operate transmission facilities in accordance with FERC-approved rates.  AEP has equity and voting ownership of   86.5%   with the other owner having   13.5%   interest.  Management has concluded that Transource Energy is a VIE and that AEP is the primary beneficiary because AEP has the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity and AEP s equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, AEP is required to consolidate Transource Energy.  In January 2014, Transource Missouri (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transource Energy) acquired transmission assets from the non-controlling owner and issued debt and received a capital contribution to fund the acquisition.  The majority of Transource Energy s activity resulted from the asset acquisition, construction projects, debt issuance and capital contribution.  AEP has provided capital contributions to Transource Energy of   $47 million   and   $23 million  , in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  AEP and the other owner of Transource Energy are required to ensure a specific equity level in Transource Missouri upon completion of projects or if a project is abandoned by the RTO.  See the tables below for the classification of Transource Energy s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.  
    
  The balances below represent the assets and liabilities of the VIEs that are consolidated.  These balances include intercompany transactions that are eliminated upon consolidation. 

(a) 
    Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of   $76 million  . 
              (b)

  Non-Consolidated Significant Variable Interests 
    
  DHLC is a mining operator which sells   50%   of the lignite produced to SWEPCo and   50%   to CLECO.  SWEPCo and CLECO share the executive board seats and voting rights equally.  Each entity guarantees   50%   of DHLC s debt.  SWEPCo and CLECO equally approve DHLC s annual budget.  The creditors of DHLC have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo.  As SWEPCo is the sole equity owner of DHLC, it receives   100%   of the management fee.  SWEPCo s total billings from DHLC for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were   $93 million  ,   $56 million   and   $60 million  , respectively.  SWEPCo is not required to consolidate DHLC as it is not the primary beneficiary, although SWEPCo holds a significant variable interest in DHLC.  SWEPCo s equity investment in DHLC is included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on SWEPCo s balance sheets. 
    
  SWEPCo s investment in DHLC was: 

AEP and FirstEnergy Corp. (FirstEnergy) have a joint venture in Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline, LLC (PATH).  PATH is a series limited liability company and was created to construct, through its operating companies, a high-voltage transmission line project in the PJM region.  PATH consists of the  West Virginia Series (PATH-WV),  owned equally by subsidiaries of FirstEnergy and AEP, and the  Allegheny Series  which is   100%   owned by a subsidiary of FirstEnergy.  Provisions exist within the PATH-WV agreement that make it a VIE.  AEP has no interest or control in the  Allegheny Series .  AEP is not required to consolidate PATH-WV as AEP is not the primary beneficiary, although  
    291 

      AEP holds a significant variable interest in PATH-WV.  AEP s equity investment in PATH-WV is included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets.  AEP and FirstEnergy share the returns and losses equally in PATH-WV.  AEP s subsidiaries and FirstEnergy s subsidiaries provide services to the PATH companies through service agreements.  The entities recover costs through regulated rates. 
    
  In August 2012, the PJM board cancelled the PATH Project, the transmission project that PATH was intended to develop and removed it from the 2012 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan.  In September 2012, the PATH Project companies submitted an application to the FERC requesting authority to recover prudently-incurred costs associated with the PATH Project.  In November 2012, the FERC issued an order accepting the PATH Project s abandonment cost recovery application, subject to settlement procedures and hearing.  The parties to the case have been unable to reach a settlement agreement and in March 2014, settlement judge procedures were terminated.  Hearings at FERC were held in March and April 2015.  In September 2015, the Administrative Law Judge who conducted the hearings issued an Initial Decision, with recommendations on various issues in the case.  The Initial Decision has no binding effect.  Additional briefing was submitted during the fourth quarter of 2015.  The case is currently pending before FERC. 
    
  AEP s investment in PATH-WV was: 

As of December 31,   2015  , AEP s   $21 million   investment in PATH-WV was included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheet.  If AEP cannot ultimately recover the investment related to PATH-WV, it could reduce future net income and cash flows.  
    
  AEPSC provides certain managerial and professional services to AEP s subsidiaries.  Parent is the sole equity owner of AEPSC.  AEP management controls the activities of AEPSC.  The costs of the services are based on a direct charge or on a prorated basis and billed to the AEP subsidiary companies at AEPSC s cost.  AEP subsidiaries have not provided financial or other support outside of the reimbursement of costs for services rendered.  AEPSC finances its operations through cost reimbursement from other AEP subsidiaries.  There are no other terms or arrangements between AEPSC and any of the AEP subsidiaries that could require additional financial support from an AEP subsidiary or expose them to losses outside of the normal course of business.  AEPSC and its billings are subject to regulation by the FERC.  AEP subsidiaries are exposed to losses to the extent they cannot recover the costs of AEPSC through their normal business operations.  AEP subsidiaries are considered to have a significant interest in AEPSC due to their activity in AEPSC s cost reimbursement structure.  However, AEP subsidiaries do not have control over AEPSC.  AEPSC is consolidated by AEP.  In the event AEPSC would require financing or other support outside the cost reimbursement billings, this financing would be provided by AEP. 
    
    292 

      Total AEPSC billings to the Registrant Subsidiaries were as follows: 

The carrying amount and classification of variable interest in AEPSC s accounts payable are as follows: 

AEGCo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, is consolidated by AEP.  AEGCo owns a   50%   ownership interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 1, leases a   50%   interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 and owns   100%   of the Lawrenceburg Generating Station.  AEGCo sells all the output from the Rockport Plant to I M and KPCo.  AEGCo has a Unit Power Agreement associated with the Lawrenceburg Generating Station which was assigned by OPCo to AGR effective January 1, 2014.  AEP has agreed to provide AEGCo with the funds necessary to satisfy all of the debt obligations of AEGCo.  I M is considered to have a significant interest in AEGCo due to these transactions.  I M is exposed to losses to the extent it cannot recover the costs of AEGCo through its normal business operations.  In the event AEGCo would require financing or other support outside the billings to I M and KPCo, this financing would be provided by AEP.  Total billings to I M from AEGCo for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were   $232 million  ,   $268 million   and   $252 million  .  Total billings to OPCo from AEGCo for the year ended December 31,   2013   was   $148 million  .  The carrying amount of I M s liabilities associated with AEGCo as of December 31,   2015   and   2014   was   $17 million   and   $20 million  , respectively.  Management estimates the maximum exposure of loss to be equal to the amount of such liability.  For additional information regarding AEGCo s lease, see  Rockport Lease  section of Note   13  . 

293 

      18  .    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  Property, plant and equipment is shown functionally on the face of the Registrants  balance sheets.  The following tables include the Registrants  total plant balances for the years ended   December 31, 2015 and 2014  : 

(a) 
    AEP and SWEPCo s regulated generation and regulated CWIP include amounts related to SWEPCo s Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant. 
              (b) 
    Amount excludes   $482 million   of Property, Plant and Equipment - Net classified as Assets from Discontinued Operations on the balance sheet.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
       
    294 

      Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 
    
  The Registrants provide for depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment, excluding coal-mining properties, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, generally using composite rates by functional class.  The following tables provide total regulated annual composite depreciation rates and depreciable lives for the Registrants: 

295 

The following table includes the nonregulated annual composite depreciation rate ranges and nonregulated depreciable life ranges for AEP.  Depreciation rate ranges and depreciable life ranges are Not Meaningful (NM) for APCo, I M, OPCo and PSO for   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . 

(a) 
    SWEPCo s nonregulated property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over a range of   3   to   20   years. 
       
  SWEPCo provides for depreciation, depletion and amortization of coal-mining assets over each asset s estimated useful life or the estimated life of each mine, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method for mining structures and equipment.  SWEPCo uses either the straight-line method or the units-of-production method to amortize mine development costs and deplete coal rights based on estimated recoverable tonnages.  SWEPCo includes these costs in fuel expense. 
    
  For regulated operations, the composite depreciation rate generally includes a component for non-asset retirement obligation (non-ARO) removal costs, which is credited to Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization.  Actual removal costs incurred are charged to Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization.  Any excess of accrued non-ARO removal costs over actual removal costs incurred is reclassified from Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization and reflected as a regulatory liability.  For nonregulated operations, non-ARO removal costs are expensed as incurred.   
    
  Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) 
    
  The Registrants record ARO in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations  for legal obligations for asbestos removal and for the retirement of certain ash disposal facilities, closure and monitoring of underground carbon storage facilities at Mountaineer Plant, wind farms and certain coal mining facilities.  I M records ARO for the decommissioning of the Cook Plant.  The Registrants have identified, but not recognized, ARO liabilities related to electric transmission and distribution assets as a result of certain easements on property on which assets are owned.  Generally, such easements are perpetual and require only the retirement and removal of assets upon the cessation of the property s use.  The retirement obligation is not estimable for such easements since the Registrants plan to use their facilities indefinitely.  The retirement obligation would only be recognized if and when the Registrants abandon or cease the use of specific easements, which is not expected. 
    
  As of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , I M s ARO liability for nuclear decommissioning of the Cook Plant was   $1.18 billion   and   $1.27 billion  , respectively.  These liabilities are reflected in Asset Retirement Obligations on I M s balance sheets.  As of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , the fair value of I M s assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling decommissioning liabilities totaled   $1.80 billion   and   $1.79 billion  , respectively.  These assets are included in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on I M s balance sheets. 
    
    296 

      The Registrants recorded an increase in asset retirement obligations in the second quarter of 2015, primarily related to the final Coal Combustion Residual Rule, which was published in the Federal Register in April 2015.  The Federal EPA now regulates the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals (CCR), including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired electric generating units and also FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants.  The Federal EPA regulates CCR as a non-hazardous solid waste and established minimum federal solid waste management standards.  Noncash increases related to the CCR Rule are recorded as Property, Plant and Equipment.  The following is a reconciliation of the   2015   and   2014   aggregate carrying amounts of ARO by Registrant, including a   $95 million   second quarter increase and other adjustments recorded in 2015: 

(a) 
    Amount includes settlement of liabilities of   $81 million   associated with the sale of the Muskingum River Plant site.  See the  Muskingum River Plant  section of Note   7  . 
              (b) 
    Amount includes a   $20 million   reduction in the ARO liability due to the execution of a joint use agreement with a third party. 
              (c) 
    Includes ARO related to ash disposal facilities. 
               (e) 
    Includes ARO related to Sabine and DHLC. 
              (f) 
    Includes ARO related to asbestos removal. 
       
  Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalization 
    
  The Registrants  amounts of allowance for equity funds used during construction are summarized in the following table: 

297 

      The Registrants  amounts of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction, including capitalized interest, are summarized in the following table: 

Jointly-owned Electric Facilities (Applies to AEP, I M, PSO and SWEPCo) 
    
  The Registrants have electric facilities that are jointly-owned with affiliated and non-affiliated companies.  Using its own financing, each participating company is obligated to pay its share of the costs of these jointly-owned facilities in the same proportion as its ownership interest.  Each Registrant s proportionate share of the operating costs associated with these facilities is included in its statements of income and the investments and accumulated depreciation are reflected in its balance sheets under Property, Plant and Equipment as follows: 

298 

(a) 
    Operated by AGR. 
              (b) 
    Operated by The Dayton Power   Light Company, a non-affiliated company. 
              (c) 
    Operated by Dynegy Corporation, a non-affiliated company.  AEP s portion of Beckjord Plant, Unit 6 was impaired in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
              (d) 
    Varying percentages of ownership. 
              (e) 
    Operated by I M. 
              (f) 
    Amounts include I M s 50% ownership of both Unit 1 and capital additions for Unit 2.  Unit 2 is subject to an operating lease with a non-affiliated company.  See the  Rockport Lease  section of Note   13  . 
               (h) 
    Operated by PSO, which owns   15.6%  .  Also jointly-owned (  54.7%  ) by TNC and various non-affiliated companies. 
              (i) 
    Operated by CLECO, a non-affiliated company. 
              (j) 
    Operated by SWEPCo. 
              NA 
    Not applicable. 
       299 

      19  .    COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  2014 Disposition Plant Severance 
    
  Management retired several generation plants or units of plants during 2015.  These plant closures resulted in involuntary severances.  The severance program provides two weeks of base pay for every year of service along with other severance benefits. 
    
  The Registrants  disposition plant severance activity for the   twelve months ended     December 31, 2015   is described in the following table: 

(a)  Includes amounts received from affiliates for expenses related to jointly-owned plant. 
    
  The Registrants recorded charges to Other Operation expense in 2014 primarily related to employees at the disposition plants.  The total amounts incurred in 2014 by the Registrants were as follows: 

These expenses, net of adjustments, relate primarily to severance benefits and are included primarily in Other Operation expense on the statements of income.  Of AEP s cumulative expense, approximately   33%   was within the Generation    Marketing segment and   67%   was within the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment.  The remaining liability is included in Other Current Liabilities on the balance sheets.  The Registrants incurred additional charges during the second quarter of 2015 as severance plans were finalized after the plants were retired.  Management does not expect additional severance costs to be incurred related to this initiative. 
    
    300 

      2012 Sustainable Cost Reductions 
    
  In April 2012, management initiated a process to identify strategic repositioning opportunities and efficiencies that resulted in sustainable cost savings.  Management selected a consulting firm to facilitate an organizational and process evaluation and a second firm to evaluate current employee benefit programs.  The process resulted in involuntary severances and was completed by the end of the first quarter of 2013.  The severance program provides two weeks of base pay for every year of service along with other severance benefits. 
    
  The Registrants recorded charges to Other Operation expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily related to severance benefits as a result of the sustainable cost reductions initiative.  The amounts incurred by Registrants were as follows: 

301 

      20  .    UNAUDITED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  In management s opinion, the unaudited quarterly information reflects all normal and recurring accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for interim periods.  Quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of a full year s operations because of various factors.  The unaudited quarterly financial information for each Registrant is as follows: 

302 

(a) 
    Includes sale of AEPRO (see Note   7  ). 
              (b) 
    Includes termination of coal contract and a KPCo regulatory disallowance (see Note   4  ). 
       
    303 

      AEP 
    
  The unaudited quarterly financial information relating to Common Shareholders is as follows: 

(a) 
    Quarterly Earnings per Share amounts are intended to be stand-alone calculations and are not always additive to full-year amount due to rounding. 
              (b) 
    Relates to sale of AEPRO (see Note   7  ). 
       
    304 

      21  .    GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to AEP only. 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  The changes in AEP s carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014   by operating segment are as follows: 

(a)  The goodwill of $38.8 million related to AEPRO is included in Other Classes of Assets That Are Not Major as of December 31, 2014 in Note   7  .  See  Dispositions  section of Note   7   for additional information. 
    
  In the fourth quarters of   2015   and   2014  , annual impairment tests were performed.  The fair values of the operations with goodwill were estimated using cash flow projections and other market value indicators.  There were no goodwill impairment losses.  AEP does not have any accumulated impairment on existing goodwill. 
    
  Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Acquired intangible assets subject to amortization were   $2 million   and $  5 million   as of December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, net of accumulated amortization and are included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets.  The amortization life, gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major asset class are as follows: 

Amortization of intangible assets was   $3 million  ,   $5 million   and   $14 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  The estimated total amortization is   $2 million   for 2016.

Exhibit 95 

MINE SAFETY INFORMATION 
    
  The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) imposes stringent health and safety standards on various mining operations.  The Mine Act and its related regulations affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, equipment used in mine emergency procedures, mine plans and other matters.  SWEPCo, through its ownership of Dolet Hills Lignite Company (DHLC), and KPCo and AGR, through their interest in the Conner Run fly ash impoundment, are subject to the provisions of the Mine Act.   
    
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) requires companies that operate mines to include in their periodic reports filed with the SEC, certain mine safety information covered by the Mine Act.  DHLC and Conner Run received the following notices of violation and proposed assessments under the Mine Act for the quarter ended December 31, 2015:
