PART I 
             ITEM 1. 
    BUSINESS 
     OVERVIEW 
  We are in the business of discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines for serious diseases.  We use precision medicine approaches with the goal of creating transformative drugs for patients in specialty markets.  Our business is focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF, and advancing our research and development programs in other indications, while maintaining our financial strength.    
  Cystic Fibrosis  
  Our goal is twofold:  to develop treatment regimens that will provide benefits to as many patients with CF as possible and to enhance those benefits.  Our two marketed medicines are ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which are approved to treat patients with CF who have specific mutations in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or   CFTR,   gene.  
  ORKAMBI 
  ORKAMBI (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in July 2015 and by the European Commission in November 2015, for the treatment of patients with CF twelve years of age and older who have two copies (homozygous) of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  We believe that there are approximately 20,500 patients in the United States and European Union currently eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI, of which we believe more than 4,500 patients had begun treatment as of December 31, 2015.  We recently completed the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  We believe that there are approximately 5,800 patients in the United States and European Union within this patient population.    
  KALYDECO 
  KALYDECO (ivacaftor) was approved in 2012 in the United States and European Union as a treatment for patients with CF six years of age and older who have the G551D mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  Since 2012, we have increased the number of patients who are being treated with KALYDECO in the United States and non-U.S. markets by expanding the label for KALYDECO to include patients with CF who have additional mutations in their   CFTR   gene and to include patients in additional age demographics.  We believe that there are approximately 4,000 patients in North America, Europe and Australia who currently are eligible for treatment with KALYDECO. 
  CF Development Programs 
  We have multiple development programs in the field of CF, including: 
             
    VX-661, a corrector compound that we are evaluating in a Phase 3 development program in combination with ivacaftor in multiple CF patient populations who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene; 
                
    VX-371, an investigational epithelial sodium channel, or ENaC, inhibitor, that is being evaluated in a Phase 2 development program and which we exclusively licensed from Parion Sciences, Inc., or Parion, in 2015; and 
                
    VX-152 and VX-440, two next-generation CFTR corrector compounds that entered Phase 1 clinical trials in the fourth quarter of 2015 and that we plan to evaluate as part of combination treatment regimens. 
     Research and Development Programs 
  We are engaged in a number of other research and mid- and early-stage development programs, including programs in the areas of oncology, pain and neurology.  We plan to continue investing in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines with a focus on CF and other genetic diseases, oncology, pain and neurology.  We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS 
  Background 
  CF is a rare, life-threatening genetic disease affecting approximately 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia.  CF is caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein resulting from mutations in the   CFTR   gene.  To develop CF, children must inherit two defective   CFTR   genes, which are referred to as alleles - one from each parent.  There are more than 1,900 known mutations in the   CFTR   gene, some of which result in CF, including two of the most prevalent mutations, the F508del mutation and the G551D mutation.   
  The F508del mutation results in a defect in the CFTR protein in which the CFTR protein does not reach the surface of cells in sufficient quantities.  The G551D mutation results in a defect in the CFTR protein in which the defective CFTR protein reaches the surface of a cell but does not efficiently transport chloride ions across the cell membrane.  The absence of working CFTR proteins results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of cells in a number of organs, including the lungs.  As a result, thick, sticky mucus builds up and blocks the passages in many organs, leading to a variety of symptoms.  In particular, mucus builds up and clogs the airways in the lungs, causing chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, keeps the CFTR protein channels on the cell surface open more often, to increase the flow of salt and water into and out of the cell.  CFTR correctors, such as lumacaftor, VX-661, VX-152 and VX-440 are believed to help CFTR protein reach the cell surface.  We believe that ENaC inhibitors, such as VX-371, may help maintain mucus hydration and accelerate pulmonary mucus clearance. 
  We use the brand name for our products when we refer to the product that has been approved and with respect to the indications on the approved label.  Otherwise, including in discussions of our CF development programs, we refer to our compounds by their scientific (or generic) name. 
  ORKAMBI (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor)  
  ORKAMBI is an orally-administered combination therapy comprised of lumacaftor, a CFTR corrector, and ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, that is approved in the United States, European Union and Canada for the treatment of patients with CF twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  We have submitted regulatory applications seeking approval for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in Australia based on TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, two Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor that we completed in 2014.   
  We recently completed a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  The clinical trial, which enrolled 58 patients, met its primary safety endpoint and data from the clinical trial showed that the combination was generally well-tolerated.  The most common adverse events were cough, headache, infective pulmonary exacerbation, nasal congestion, abdominal pain, increased sputum and elevated liver enzymes.  Two patients (3.4%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events.  In the clinical trial improvements in a secondary endpoint measuring pulmonary function, including improvements in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second, or ppFEV1, and an exploratory endpoint measuring lung clearance index were observed.  Based on these results, we plan to submit a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, to the FDA in the second quarter of 2016 seeking approval for patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  A second Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in this same patient population is ongoing.  If successful, this clinical trial will be used to support approval of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in this patient population in the European Union.  The primary endpoint of this six-month clinical trial, which is expected to enroll 200 patients, is absolute change in lung clearance index.   
  KALYDECO (ivacaftor) 
  KALYDECO (ivacaftor) is an orally-administered CFTR potentiator that is approved in the United States, European Union, Australia and Canada for the treatment of certain patients with CF who have specific mutations in their   CFTR   gene.  In the United States, KALYDECO is approved for the treatment of patients with CF two years of age and older who have one of the following mutations in their   CFTR   gene:  G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1349D and R117H.  In the European Union, KALYDECO is approved for the treatment of patients with CF (i) two years of age and older who have one of the following mutations in their   CFTR   gene:  G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S,  
      
  2 

G1244E, S1251N, S1255P and G1349D and (ii) eighteen years of age and older who have the R117H mutation in their   CFTR   gene. 
  In October 2015, we submitted an sNDA to the FDA for KALYDECO for patients with CF two years of age and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations.  The sNDA was based on preclinical data for ivacaftor in residual function mutations, the established clinical profile of KALYDECO and on previously reported data from an exploratory Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with CF.  In February 2016, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding the sNDA pursuant to which the FDA determined that it cannot approve the sNDA in its present form. We plan to meet with the FDA regarding the sNDA to determine an appropriate path forward. 
  In the first quarter of 2016, we plan to commence a clinical trial for ivacaftor in patients with CF less than two years of age to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on markers of CF disease in young children.  This clinical trial will utilize a weight-based dose of ivacaftor granules that can be mixed in soft foods or liquids. 
  VX-661 in Combination with Ivacaftor 
  VX-661 is an orally-administered CFTR corrector drug candidate that we are developing in combination with ivacaftor.  In the first quarter of 2015, we initiated a Phase 3 development program comprised of four separate clinical trials for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in multiple CF patient populations who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  Details of the patient population and status of each of these clinical trials is as follows: 

Two copies of the F508del in their CFTR gene  :  We expect enrollment to be complete in mid-2016 and expect data from this clinical trial by early 2017; 
                
    One copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation in their CFTR gene that results in a gating defect in the CFTR protein  :  We expect enrollment to be complete by the end of 2016 and expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2017; 
                
    One copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation in their CFTR gene that results in residual CFTR function  : We expect enrollment to be complete by the end of 2016 and expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2017; and 
                
    One copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation that results in minimal CFTR function  : We expect enrollment in the first part of this clinical trial to be complete in mid-2016 and an interim futility analysis of efficacy data, which will be conducted by an independent third-party, to be completed by the end of 2016.  If supported by data from the first part of this clinical trial, we would subsequently initiate the second part of this clinical trial. 
       
  In addition to evaluating the efficacy of the combination regimen, these four Phase 3 clinical trials will provide safety data on the combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor to support the planned development of a triple combination regimen that includes a next-generation corrector in combination with VX-661 and ivacaftor. 
    
  ENaC Inhibition 
  In June 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Parion to develop investigational ENaC inhibitors, including VX-371, for the potential treatment of CF and other pulmonary diseases.  Preclinical evaluation in human bronchial epithelial, or HBE, cells from patients with CF who have two copies of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene showed that the addition of VX-371 to lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor resulted in an additional increase in both airway surface liquid and cilia beat frequency compared to baseline and to the use of VX-371 or lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor alone.  Improvements in airway surface liquid height and cilia beat frequency are believed to be measures of increased hydration of the cell surface. 
    
  VX-371 is being evaluated in an exploratory Phase 2a clinical trial in approximately 120 patients with CF with any mutation in their   CFTR   gene, including those who have mutations not expected to respond to ivacaftor alone.  The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is safety, and we expect results from this clinical trial in mid-2016.  In the first quarter of 2016, we expect to initiate a placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of VX-371 to evaluate the addition of VX-371 to treatment with ORKAMBI for patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.

Next-generation CFTR Corrector Compound  s 
  We are developing two next-generation CFTR corrector compounds, VX-152 and VX-440, that we plan to evaluate as part of triple combination treatment regimens.  We initiated Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers of each of VX-152 and VX-440, alone and as part of a triple combination with VX-661 and ivacaftor, in the fourth quarter of 2015.  If these clinical trials are successful, we plan to initiate Phase 2 clinical trials of VX-152 or VX-440 as part of a triple combination with VX-661 and ivacaftor in the second half of 2016 in patients with CF who have: 

Two copies of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene; 
                
    One copy of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene and a second mutation in their   CFTR   gene that results in minimal CFTR function; and 
                
    One copy of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene and a second mutation in their   CFTR   gene that is known to be responsive to ivacaftor.  
     In HBE cells with two copies of the F508del mutation in the   CFTR   gene, as well as in HBE cells with one copy of the F508del mutation in the   CFTR   gene and a second mutation that results in minimal CFTR function, the triple combinations (VX-152/VX-661/ivacaftor and VX-440/VX-661/ivacaftor) resulted in chloride transport (measured as a percent of normal) that was approximately three-fold greater than the use of a lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination in these cells. 
    
    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS 
  Our approach to project selection and drug design aims to enhance our ability to discover and develop drug candidates by combining transformative insights into the causes of serious diseases with innovative approaches to therapeutics.  The approach starts with knowledge of human genetics and human biology, and our ability to develop complex biological assays to query the underlying biology of disease.   We leverage our expertise in assay automation, medicinal and process chemistry, modeling and informatics, biomarkers, pharmacology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, toxicology, material sciences and formulation to develop, select and advance drug candidates.  We believe that our approach has been validated through our success in moving novel drug candidates into clinical trials and obtaining marketing approvals for ORKAMBI, KALYDECO and INCIVEK (telapravir).  Currently, the disease areas that are most advanced in our research labs are: CF and other genetic diseases; DNA repair in cancer; genetically validated targets for pain; and neurological diseases.  
  We focus our research activities on developing products that would be prescribed by specialist physicians for the treatment of rare or life-threatening diseases, which are referred to as specialty markets.  Driven by these priority disease areas and by insights into the underlying mechanisms whereby diseases develop and progress, we attempt to identify multiple approaches within each indication that, either as a stand-alone therapy or combination therapy, could provide treatment options that are transformational in nature.  We select disease areas by mapping our research strengths onto disease areas with high unmet medical need, where there have been breakthrough scientific insights, and where innovative therapeutic approaches are available. 
  To augment our internal research programs, we seek to collaborate with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, leading academic research institutions, government laboratories, foundations and other organizations as needed to advance research in our areas of therapeutic interest as well as to access technologies needed to execute on our strategy.  We have established such relationships with organizations around the world and intend to extend and leverage that experience to further our research efforts to discover transformational medicines for serious diseases in specialty markets. 
  Our research and mid- and early-stage development programs currently are focused on the following areas: 
  Oncology 
  We have three oncology drug candidates in development that are designed to inhibit DNA repair pathways that are fundamental to the survival and proliferation of certain cancers.   
  VX  -970 
  Our most advanced oncology drug candidate is VX-970, an inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase, or ATR.  We plan to evaluate VX-970, both alone and and in combination with other cancer therapies, including targeted agents, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immuno-oncology therapies, in early-stage clinical trials in selected tumor types and patient  
      
  4 

subtypes that are expected to be responsive to ATR inhibition based on biomarker data.  We are conducting two Phase 1/2 clinical trials of VX-970 in combination with commonly used DNA-damaging chemotherapies in specific cohorts of triple-negative breast cancer patients and non-small cell lung cancer patients.  We expect preliminary data from these clinical trials to be available in 2016.   
  We also have entered into cooperative research and development agreements with the National Cancer Institute to evaluate VX-970 across other types of cancers.  The first clinical trial conducted pursuant to these agreements is ongoing, and several additional clinical trials are planned in patients who have non-small cell lung, head and neck, bladder, ovarian and other cancers.   
  VX-803 and VX-984 
  We are in Phase 1 development of two additional oncology drug candidates, VX-803 and VX-984.  We are evaluating escalating doses of VX-803, an ATR inhibitor, alone and in combination with chemotherapy in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial.  We recently initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of VX-984, an inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase, to evaluate escalating doses of VX-984 alone and in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. 
  Pain 
    
  We have two drug candidates, VX-150 and VX-241, that are designed to inhibit sodium channels involved in pain sensation.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate VX-150, an inhibitor of a sodium channel known as NaV 1.8, which is expected to enroll approximately 100 patients who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee.  We expect to begin clinical development of VX-241, an inhibitor of a sodium channel known as NaV 1.7, in the first half of 2016. 
  Acute Spinal Cord Injury  
    
  We have exclusively licensed VX-210, a drug candidate for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury, from BioAxone BioSciences, Inc. VX-210 is designed to inhibit a protein known as Rho that blocks neural regeneration after injury.  We expect to initiate a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in the first half of 2016 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX-210 in patients who have certain acute cervical spinal cord injuries. 
    COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION 
  Our commercial organization focuses on supporting sales of ORKAMBI and KALYDECO in the markets where such products are approved.  Our sales and marketing organizations are responsible for promoting products to health care providers and obtaining reimbursement for products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the United States and non-U.S. markets.  
  Our U.S. field-based CF commercial team is comprised of a small number of individuals whom we believe will be sufficient to support future needs.  We focus our CF marketing efforts in the United States on a relatively small number of physicians and health care professionals who write most of the prescriptions for CF medicines.  Many of these physicians and health care professionals are located at a limited number of accredited centers in the United States focused on the treatment of CF.  In international markets, we currently have a small sales force that has been promoting KALYDECO but we expect to increase the size of this sales force moderately as we launch ORKAMBI and continue to expand geographically.   
  We market our products through personal interactions with individual physicians, advertising, sending direct mail, public relations activities and other activities.  In addition, our government affairs and public policy group advocates for policies that promote life sciences innovation and increase awareness of the diseases on which we are focusing, with state and federal legislatures, government agencies, public health officials and other policy-makers.  We also have established programs in the United States that provide our products to qualified uninsured or underinsured patients at no charge or at a reduced charge, based on specific eligibility criteria. 
    COLLABORATIONS 
  We have entered into collaborations with pharmaceutical and other companies and organizations that provide us financial and other resources, including capabilities in research, development, manufacturing and sales and marketing, and licenses to intellectual property.  These collaborations have provided us with drug candidates and/or important financial and non- 
      
  5 

financial resources that have contributed to our products and a number of the drug candidates in our current development pipeline.  We may seek to license or acquire drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to add to our pipeline or to provide us with new commercial opportunities.  In particular, we are focusing on drug candidates for the treatment of patients with CF and other third-party drug candidates that could be developed for specialty markets.  Furthermore, we may seek collaborators to support, develop and/or commercialize some of our current drug candidates and/or additional drug candidates that may emerge from our research activities.   
  Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated 
  We began working with CFFT in 1998.  We entered into a collaboration agreement with CFFT in 2004 and have amended it several times to support research and development activities.  We are obligated to pay CFFT tiered royalties ranging from single digits to sub-teens, calculated as a percentage of net sales, on ivacaftor, lumacaftor and VX-661.  Under the collaboration agreement, we also are obligated to make a total of two one-time commercial milestone payments upon achievement of certain sales levels for sales of lumacaftor, the first of which was earned in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the second of which we expect to be earned in the first quarter of 2016.    
  For ivacaftor, lumacaftor and VX-661, we will have royalty obligations to CFFT until the expiration of patents covering that compound.  We have patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of ivacaftor that expire in 2027 and 2025, respectively, subject to potential patent life extensions.  We have patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of lumacaftor that expire in 2030 and 2026, respectively, subject to potential patent life extensions.  We have patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of VX-661 that expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively, subject to potential patent life extensions.  
  Parion Sciences, Inc. 
    
  In June 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Parion pursuant to which we are collaborating with Parion to develop ENaC inhibitors, including VX-371 (formerly P-1037) and VX-551 (formerly P-1055), for the potential treatment of CF and other pulmonary diseases.   
  We are leading development activities for VX-371 and are responsible for all costs, subject to certain exceptions, related to its development and commercialization.  We also will lead development activities for VX-551, which is in pre-clinical development.  Under the terms of the agreement, we received worldwide development and commercial rights to VX-371 and VX-551 for the potential treatment of CF and all other pulmonary diseases and have the option to select additional compounds discovered in Parion s research program.  Parion received an $80.0 million up-front payment and has the potential to receive up to an additional (i) $490.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments for development of ENaC inhibitors in CF, including $360.0 million related to global filing and approval milestones, (ii) $370.0 million in development and regulatory milestones for VX-371 and VX-551 in non-CF pulmonary indications and (iii) $230.0 million in development and regulatory milestones if we elect to develop an additional ENaC inhibitor from Parion s research program.  Parion will receive tiered royalties on potential sales of licensed products that range from the low double digits to mid-teens as a percentage of sales.   
  We may terminate the agreement upon 90 days  notice to Parion prior to any licensed product receiving marketing approval or upon 180 days  notice after a licensed product has received marketing approval.  Parion may terminate the agreement upon 30 days  notice if Vertex experiences a change of control prior to the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial for a licensed product, subject to our right to receive specified royalties on any subsequent commercialization of licensed products.  The agreement also may be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions.  Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations, which expire on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the date the last-to-expire patent covering a licensed product expires or (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale in the country. 
  CRISPR Therapeutics AG 
  In October 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration, option and license agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics AG, or CRISPR, and its affiliates to collaborate on the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology.  We have the exclusive right to license up to six CRISPR-Cas9-based targets.  In connection with the CRISPR agreement, we paid CRISPR an upfront  
      
  6 

payment of $75.0 million and made a $30.0 million investment in CRISPR pursuant to a convertible loan agreement that converted into preferred stock in January 2016. 
  We will fund all of the discovery activities conducted pursuant to the agreement.  For potential hemoglobinapathy treatments, including treatments for sickle cell disease, we will share equally with CRISPR all research and development costs and worldwide revenues.  For other targets that we elect to license, we would lead all development and global commercialization activities.  For each of up to six targets that we elect to license, other than hemoglobinapathy targets, CRISPR has the potential to receive up to $420.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties on net sales. 
  We may terminate the agreement upon 90 days  notice to CRISPR prior to any product receiving marketing approval or upon 270 days  notice after a product has received marketing approval.  The agreement also may be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions.  Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of our payment obligations under the agreement. 
  BioAxone Biosciences, Inc. 
  In October 2014, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with BioAxone.  Pursuant to this agreement, we are collaborating with BioAxone on the research, development and commercialization of VX-210 (formerly referred to as Cethrin), a Rho inhibitor controlled by BioAxone, for the treatment of patients who have spinal cord injuries.  
  We paid BioAxone initial payments of $10.0 million and BioAxone has the potential to receive up to $90.0 million in milestones and fees, including development and regulatory milestone payments and a license continuation fee.  In addition, BioAxone would receive royalties and commercial milestones based on future net product sales, if any.  We hold an option to purchase BioAxone at a predetermined price.  The option expires on the earliest of (a) the day the FDA accepts a Biologics License Application submission for VX-210, (b) the day we elect to continue the license instead of exercising the option to purchase BioAxone and (c) March 15, 2018, subject to our option to extend this date by one year.  We may terminate our agreement with BioAxone upon 90 days  notice or immediately if we determine that a licensed product is unsafe for administration to humans.  The agreement also may be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other or by BioAxone for our inactivity with respect to VX-210, in each case subject to notice and cure provisions.  Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue until the expiration of our royalty obligations.  
  Outlicense Arrangements 
  We have entered into various agreements pursuant to which we have outlicensed rights to certain drug candidates to third-party collaborators.  Pursuant to these outlicense arrangements, our collaborators become responsible for all costs related to the continued development of such drug candidates and obtain development and commercialization rights to these drug candidates.  Depending on the terms of the arrangements, our collaborators may be required to make upfront payments, milestone payments upon the achievement of certain product research and development objectives and/or pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration. 
    
  Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
  In 2014, we entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen Inc.  Pursuant to this agreement, Janssen Inc. has an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize certain drug candidates for the treatment of influenza, including VX-787.  We received non-refundable payments of $35.0 million from Janssen Inc. in 2014 and have the potential to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on future product sales, if any.  Janssen Inc. is responsible for costs related to the development and commercialization of the compounds.  Janssen Inc. may terminate the agreement, subject to certain exceptions, upon six months  notice.  
    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
  We actively seek protection for our products and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and copyrights, as appropriate.  In addition, we rely upon trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information and products.  We have patents and pending patent applications that relate to potential drug targets, compounds we are developing to modulate those targets, methods of making or using those compounds and proprietary elements of our drug discovery platform. 
      
  7 

Much of our technology and many of our processes depend upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel.  To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we require all employees, as well as our consultants and advisors when feasible, to enter into confidentiality agreements that require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants and advisors in the course of their service to us. 
  While we have numerous issued patents and pending patent applications in our patent portfolio, we believe that the patents and patent applications in the United States and the European Union that are the most important to our business are those that claim the composition-of-matter of our drugs and drug candidates that have progressed at least into Phase 3 clinical trials.  The following table sets forth the status of such primary patents and patent applications in the United States and the European Union covering the composition-of-matter of these drugs and drug candidates: 

We hold issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States, and in foreign countries we deem appropriate, claiming intellectual property developed as part of our research and development programs.  In addition to the composition-of-matter patents and patent applications listed above, we hold or have exclusive licenses to the following intellectual property: 
             
    U.S. and foreign patent applications covering CF potentiators, correctors and ENaC inhibitors, including ivacaftor, lumacaftor, VX-661, VX-371, VX-152 and VX-440 and many other related compounds, and the use of those potentiators, correctors and ENaC inhibitors to treat CF. 
                   
    U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering VX-210 and the use of VX-210 to treat neurology indications. 
                 
    U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering the manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions, related solid forms, formulations, dosing regimens and methods of use of these compounds, including ivacaftor and lumacaftor. 
     We cannot be certain, however, that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. 
  From time to time we enter into non-exclusive license agreements for proprietary third-party technology used in connection with our research activities.  These license agreements typically provide for the payment by us of a license fee, but may also include terms providing for milestone payments or royalties for the development and/or commercialization of our drug products arising from the related research. 
  Ivacaftor was granted orphan drug status in the United States and the European Union.  We have a U.S. patent that covers the composition-of-matter of ivacaftor that we expect will provide intellectual property protection in the United States through its expiration date in 2027.  We have a European patent that covers the composition-of-matter of ivacaftor that we expect will provide intellectual property protection in the European Union through its expiration date in 2025, subject to potential extension.  We are entitled to orphan drug exclusivity for ivacaftor in the United States and the European Union, which means that the FDA may not approve another application to market ivacaftor for the same indication for a period of seven years following approval, and the EMA cannot accept an MAA for a drug similar to ivacaftor for a period of ten years following approval.  As a result of the orphan drug exclusivity, even if a competitor successfully challenges the ivacaftor patents, it could not obtain approval from the FDA to market ivacaftor in the United States for the treatment of patients who  
      
  8 

have one of the mutations to the   CFTR   gene for which KALYDECO is currently approved until 2019, or submit an MAA in the European Union for the treatment of patients who have one of the mutations to the   CFTR   gene for which KALYDECO is currently approved until 2022, except in very limited circumstances. 
  Lumacaftor, and the fixed dose combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, were granted orphan drug status in the United States.  We have patents in the United States and European Union that cover the composition of matter of lumacaftor that we expect will provide intellectual property protection in these jurisdictions through their expiration dates in 2030 and 2026, respectively, subject to potential extension. 
  VX-661 was granted orphan drug status in the United States and the European Union.  We have patents in the United States and European Union that cover the composition of matter of VX-661 that we expect will provide intellectual property protection in these jurisdictions through their expiration dates in 2027 and 2028, respectively, subject to potential extension. 
    MANUFACTURING 
  Manufacturing Approach and Philosophy 
  As we market and sell our approved products and advance our drug candidates through clinical development toward commercialization, we continue to build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources.  We rely on internal capabilities and an international network of third parties to manufacture and distribute our products for commercial sale and post-approval clinical trials and to manufacture and distribute our drug candidates for clinical trials.  Wherever possible, we seek to establish multiple suppliers for each raw material and step in the manufacturing process, however our supply chain includes a single-source manufacturer for (i) one step in the ivacaftor manufacturing process and (ii) the manufacture of the oral granule formulation of KALYDECO that is used for patients with CF two to five years of age. 
  We expect that we will continue for the foreseeable future to rely on third parties to meet most of our commercial supply needs and a significant portion of our clinical supply needs.  We have established our own small-scale manufacturing capabilities, which we use for clinical trial supplies and as an additional source for commercial supplies.   
  Our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step international endeavor.  Third-party contract manufacturers, including some in China, supply us with raw materials, and convert these raw materials into drug substance, and convert the drug substance into final dosage form.  Establishing and managing this global supply chain for each of our drugs and drug candidates requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. 
  We have developed systems and processes to track, monitor and oversee our third-party manufacturers  activities, including a quality assurance program intended to ensure that our third-party manufacturers comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP.  We regularly evaluate the performance of our third-party manufacturers with the objective of confirming their continuing capabilities to meet our needs efficiently and economically.  Manufacturing facilities, both foreign and domestic, are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and other U.S. and foreign government authorities.  
  Manufacture of KALYDECO (ivacaftor) 
  We obtain ivacaftor to meet our commercial and clinical supply needs through a third-party manufacturing network.  A disruption in the commercial supply of KALYDECO would have a significant effect on patients, our business and our product revenues.  A disruption in the clinical supply of ivacaftor could delay the completion of clinical trials and/or affect timelines for submitting regulatory filings.  
  Manufacture of ORKAMBI (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) 
  We have developed several manufacturing processes to produce commercial quantities of ORKAMBI, including a process utilizing continuous manufacturing technology as well as a batch manufacturing process.  We have established manufacturing capabilities at our third-party manufacturer in the United Kingdom that is producing commercial quantities of ORKAMBI using a batch manufacturing process we designed.  We have established continuous manufacturing capabilities and obtained validation for these capabilities at our facility located in Boston, Massachusetts.  Continuous process drug product manufacturing may result in reduced cost, reduced development and production timelines and increased market  
      
  9 

response flexibility.  While continuous process manufacturing has been used in many industries, we believe that we are the first company to obtain FDA approval for a fully-continuous drug product manufacturing process.    
  Manufacture of VX-661/Ivacaftor 
  We are using both a batch manufacturing process and a continuous drug product manufacturing process to obtain a supply of VX-661 tablets to be used in our Phase 3 clinical trials of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor.  If we successfully complete development and obtain approval for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, we plan to produce our commercial supply of VX-661 using a continuous drug product manufacturing process. 
    COMPETITION 
  The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive research efforts, rapid technological progress and intense competition.  There are many public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, engaged in developing products for the indications our drugs are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities.  Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies, other public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do.  We face competition based on the safety and efficacy of our products and drug candidates, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability and cost of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price, patent protection and other factors.  Our competitors may develop or commercialize more effective, safer or more affordable products than we are able to develop or commercialize or obtain more effective patent protection.  As a result, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we do, which would adversely affect our competitive position, the likelihood that our drug candidates, if approved, would achieve and maintain market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful revenues from our products.  Future competitive products may render our products, or future products, obsolete or noncompetitive.  
  Cystic Fibrosis 
  An increasing number of companies are seeking to identify and develop drug candidates for the treatment of CF, including companies such as Concert Pharmaceuticals, Genzyme, which is a division of Sanofi, Novartis, Pfizer, ProQR Therapeutics, PTC Therapeutics, Shire and several private companies.  Although we are the first company to successfully develop drugs that treat the underlying cause of CF, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO are collectively approved to treat only a portion of patients with CF.  Our competitors have research and development programs directed at identifying and developing CFTR potentiators, CFTR correctors, ENaC inhibitors and drug candidates with other mechanisms of action or that utilize new therapeutic approaches that seek to address the underlying cause of CF.  Our success in rapidly developing and commercializing KALYDECO and ORKAMBI may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of these potential treatments for CF.  If one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a treatment for patients with CF, our revenues from ORKAMBI, KALYDECO and/or our other CF drug candidates, if then approved, could face significant competitive pressure. 
    GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
  The research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, safety monitoring, record keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of our products and drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities. 
      
  10 

United States Government Regulation 
  New Drug Application Approval Processes 
  In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, including small molecules, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implementing regulations.  The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.  Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval, may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.  These sanctions could include: 
             
    refusal to approve or delay in review of pending applications; 
                
    withdrawal of an approval or the implementation of limitations on a previously approved indication for use; 
                
    imposition of a clinical hold, a risk mitigation and evaluation strategy or other safety-related limitations; 
                
    warning letters or  untitled letters  
                
    product seizures; 
                
    total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or 
                
    injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. 
     The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
             
    completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and other applicable regulations; 
                
    submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical trials in the United States may begin; 
                
    performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
                
    submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
                
    satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 
                
    FDA review and approval of the NDA. 
     Once a drug candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.  Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal pharmacology and toxicology studies.  An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND.  Preclinical or nonclinical testing typically continues even after the IND is submitted.  In addition to including the results of the preclinical studies, the IND also will include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety.  The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold.  If an IND is placed on clinical hold, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.  A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND, and may affect one or more specific clinical trials or all clinical trials conducted under the IND. 
  All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP.  They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.  Each protocol and any amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently in other situations, including the occurrence of serious adverse events.  An  
      
  11 

institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and any amendments before a clinical trial commences or continues at that institution, approve the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, and monitor the clinical trial until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 
  Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
             
    Phase 1.    The drug initially is introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination.  In the case of some drug candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the drug candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
                
    Phase 2.    Clinical trials are initiated in a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
                
    Phase 3.    Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.  These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the drug candidate and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling. 
     Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.  The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the healthy volunteers or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to healthy volunteers or patients. 
  We estimate that it generally takes 10 to 15 years, or possibly longer, to discover, develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States, as outlined below: 

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points.  These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 testing, and before an NDA is submitted.  Meetings at other times may be requested.  These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development.  Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the drug candidate. 
  As part of the development process, companies usually complete animal safety studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements.  The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate, and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final products.  Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life. 
  The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug candidate.  The FDA reviews each NDA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts it for filing.  It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. 
      
  12 

Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review.  The FDA may not approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data.  Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.  The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug candidate is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the drug candidate s identity, strength, quality and purity.  The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved and under what conditions.  The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.  Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the drug candidate is manufactured and tested. 
  The FDA may require, as a condition of approval, restricted distribution and use, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising or commitments to conduct additional research post-approval.  The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form.  The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA.  If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
  Biologics License Application Process 
  Certain of our drug candidates may be regulated by the FDA under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act as biologics. Biologics can present special safety, efficacy and manufacturing challenges that may differ from those present in the regulation of small molecule drugs.  As such, while similar to the NDA review process described above, in lieu of filing an NDA, biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, and approval of such BLA by the FDA prior to being marketed in the U.S.  
  Expedited Review and Approval 
  The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drug candidates, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints.  Even if a drug candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.  Generally, drug candidates that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments.  For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drug candidates to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need.  Priority review is designed to give drug candidates that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months.  Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug candidate and expedite review of the application for a drug candidate designated for priority review.  Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs that treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome.  As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials. 
  In July 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was enacted, amending the FDCA.  As part of FDASIA, Congress created a drug designation called  Breakthrough Therapy.   This designation is intended to facilitate expedited development and review of a compound which, alone or in combination with one or more other compounds, is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the compound may demonstrate substantial clinical improvement over existing therapies.  Breakthrough Therapy designation may be requested at the filing of, or as an amendment to, an IND based on criteria established by the FDA.   
  Actions identified in FDASIA that may expedite the development and review of a Breakthrough Therapy include, as appropriate:  holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; and assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate efficient review of the development program and serve as  
      
  13 

a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor.  We expect that over time the FDA will develop regulations and/or provide additional guidance regarding the development of drug candidates that receive Breakthrough Therapy designation.  
  Post-approval Requirements 
  Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.  Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal of the product from the market.  In addition, under the FDCA the sponsor of an approved drug in the United States may not promote that drug for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although a physician may prescribe a drug for an off-label use in accordance with the practice of medicine.  After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.  In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 
  Products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: 
             
    record-keeping requirements; 
                
    reporting of adverse experiences with the product; 
                
    providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; 
                
    drug sampling and distribution requirements; 
                
    notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; 
                
    complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and 
                
    complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. 
     Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. 
  We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of our products.  Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt manufacture or distribution of our products, or require substantial resources to correct. 
  From time to time, new legislation is enacted that changes the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.  In addition, FDA regulations and guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.  It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed. 
  Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
  Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.  The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process.  However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product s approval date.  The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the later of the effective date of an IND or the issuance date of the patent, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application.  Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.  In the future, we may apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond  
      
  14 

their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
  Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications.  The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity.  For a new chemical entity that qualifies for Orphan Drug designation, the FDCA provides such marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years.  A product is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule responsible for the action of the drug substance.  During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such product where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.  However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.  The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug.  This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.   
  Pediatric Exclusivity 
  Section 505A of the FDCA, as amended by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, permits certain drugs to obtain an additional six months of exclusivity, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, or a written request, relating to the use of the drug in children.  The FDA may not issue a written request for clinical trials on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. 
  Exclusivity of Biologics 
  Biologics are entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to as the ACA.  The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic plus any extension term for pediatrics as discussed above.  Historically, a biologic approved under a BLA was not subject to the generic drug review and approval provisions of the FDCA.  However, the ACA created a regulatory pathway for the abbreviated approval for biological products that are demonstrated to be  biosimilar  or  interchangeable  with an FDA-approved biological product.  In order to meet the standard of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product.  Such biosimilars would reference biological products approved in the United States.  The law establishes a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products, which protects the data in the original BLA by prohibiting sponsors of biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reference to data in the original BLA.  
  Foreign Regulation 
  In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products.  Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we can commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas.  The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
  Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.  The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.  The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more  concerned  member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the  reference  member state.   
      
  15 

Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states.  The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.  Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether or not to approve the assessment report and related materials.  If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
  Orphan Drug Designation 
  Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, or more than 200,000 people in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.  Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.  After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.  Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.  KALYDECO, ORKAMBI and VX-661 have been granted designation as orphan drugs by the FDA. 
  If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.  Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor first obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease. 
  As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a drug candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made.  Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. 
  The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs, such as KALYDECO, to ensure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients.  Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug. 
  Reimbursement 
  Sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations.  These third-party payors increasingly are reducing reimbursements for medical products and services.  Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort.  The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products.  Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our revenues.  Decreases in third-party reimbursement for a product or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product could reduce physician usage of the product. 
  The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries.  Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities, which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs.  Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized.  Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.  However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.  Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.  Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.  However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D  
      
  16 

prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.  Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.  Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness.  A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to the U.S. Congress.  Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our products.  It is possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits of a competitor s product could adversely affect the sales of our products.  If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
  The ACA was enacted in March 2010 and is designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall health care costs.  With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA is designed to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs, impose an annual fee on branded pharmaceutical manufacturers and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program.  The branded prescription drug fee is not tax deductible.  We cannot predict all of the effects of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which has not yet occurred.  
  In Europe and many other foreign countries, the success of ORKAMBI, KALYDECO and of any other drug candidates we may develop, depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many foreign countries patients are unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments.  Negotiating reimbursement rates in foreign countries can delay the commercialization of a pharmaceutical product and generally results in a reimbursement rate that is lower than the net price that companies can obtain for the same product in the United States.   
  In some countries, such as Germany and France, commercial sales of a new product can begin while the reimbursement rate that a company will receive in future periods is under discussion.  In other countries, a company must complete the reimbursement discussions prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the pharmaceutical product.  The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.  For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of drugs for human use.  A member state may approve a specific price for the drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug on the market.  Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union.  There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.  
  Other United States Regulations 
  Pharmaceutical companies also are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care  fraud and abuse,  including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, and the reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. 
      
  17 

Anti-kickback Laws 
  U.S. federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.  These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services, or CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for HHS and various state agencies.  These anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program.  Remuneration is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment.  The anti-kickback laws are broad and prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. 
  The penalties for violating the anti-kickback laws can be severe.  The sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs.  Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti-kickback laws, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including third-party payors. 
  State and Federal Prohibitions on False Claims 
  The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government.  Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.  Specific intent to defraud is not required.  Provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action.  The number of filings under these provisions has increased significantly in recent years.  When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each false claim.  Conduct that violates the False Claims Act may also lead to exclusion from the federal health care programs.  Given the number of claims likely to be at issue, potential damages under the False Claims Act for even a single inappropriate arrangement could be significant.  In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payors. 
  Federal Prohibitions on Health Care Fraud and False Statements Related to Health Care Matters 
  Under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and state laws there are numerous regulations for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information.  Additional administrative simplification provisions created the following federal crimes: health care fraud, false statements relating to health care matters, theft or embezzlement in connection with a health benefit program and obstruction of criminal investigation of health care offenses.  The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including a private insurer.  The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services.  The theft or embezzlement statute prohibits knowingly and willfully embezzling, stealing or otherwise converting or misapplying the money or property of a health care benefit program.  The obstruction of criminal investigations of health care offenses statute prohibits willfully preventing, obstructing, misleading or delaying the communication of information and records relating to a violation of a federal health care offense to a criminal investigator.  A violation of any of these laws is a felony and may result in fines, or exclusion from the federal health care programs. 
  Physician Payment Sunshine Act 
  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act will require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of HHS payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals.  In February 2013, regulations were released that contain detailed guidance regarding the information that must be collected and reported.  We were required to collect information regarding such payments starting in August 2013 and were required to begin reporting such information in March 2014.  Over the next several years, we will need to continue to dedicate significant resources to enhance our systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations.  Failure to comply with the reporting requirements would result in significant civil monetary penalties.  Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration  
      
  18 

in foreign jurisdictions, including France which has adopted the   Loi Bertrand  , or French Sunshine Act, which became effective in 2013.   
  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad.  In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
  Other Regulations 
  In addition to the statutes and regulations described above, we also are subject to regulation in the United States under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, now or hereafter in effect. 
    EMPLOYEES 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , we had approximately 1,950 employees, as compared to approximately 1,830 employees as of   December 31, 2014  .  Of these employees, approximately 1,600 were based in the United States, approximately 275 were based in Europe and approximately 75 were based in Canada.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS 
  RISK FACTORS 
  Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer, possibly materially.  In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. 
  Risks Related to Our Business 
  Our business and future revenues depend heavily on our ability to successfully commercialize ORKAMBI.  If we are unable to do so, or if reimbursement levels agreed to by third-party payors are unfavorable or do not meet the expectations of investors or public equity market analysts, our business will be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would likely decline  . 
  We believe that a significant portion of the value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of ORKAMBI, which was approved in the United States in July 2015 and the European Union in November 2015 for the treatment of patients with CF twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  While we recognized our first net product revenues from sales of ORKAMBI in the United States in the second half of 2015, we are in the early stages of the commercial launch of this product and are unable to predict the future level of net product revenues we will recognize from sales of ORKAMBI in the United States.  Outside of the United States, we do not expect to recognize significant ORKAMBI net product revenues in 2016 other than in Germany due to the time it takes to complete the reimbursement discussions in many ex-U.S. countries.   
  If ORKAMBI were to become subject to problems such as safety or efficacy issues, the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products, changes in reimbursement policies of payors and other third parties, or adverse legal, administrative, regulatory or legislative developments, our ability to commercialize ORKAMBI would be impaired and our stock price would likely decline.  In addition, our ability to successfully commercialize ORKAMBI is dependent on, among other things, the rate at which patients initiate treatment of ORKAMBI, the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment and the compliance rate for patients who remain on treatment.  Since the regulations that govern pricing, coverage and reimbursement for drugs vary widely from country to country, there is no assurance that coverage and reimbursement will be available outside of the United States and, even if it is available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory.  Adverse pricing limitations or a delay in obtaining coverage and reimbursement would decrease our future net product revenues and harm our business. 
  Our future success also is dependent on our ability to expand the number of CF patients who are eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI.  We recently completed a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  The clinical trial met its primary safety endpoint and data from the clinical trial showed that the combination was generally well-tolerated.  Based on these results, we plan to submit a sNDA to the FDA in the second quarter of 2016 seeking approval for patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  A second Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in this same patient population to support approval in the European Union is ongoing.  In order to expand the market to this patient population in the European Union, the clinical trial will need to demonstrate that ORKAMBI is both safe and effective for the treatment of these patients.  These clinical trials and our discussions with regulatory authorities are subject to the same risks and uncertainties that are described in these risk factors with respect to the development of our drug candidates.  There can be no assurance that the results from these clinical trials, or the data included in our submissions to regulatory authorities, will be sufficient to obtain approval for the use of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in this additional patient population. 
  Our business is dependent on KALYDECO net product revenues and if we are unable to sustain our KALYDECO net product revenues, our business will be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would decline  . 
  KALYDECO net product revenues represented approximately   61.2%   and   79.9%   of our total revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and we expect KALYDECO net product revenues to continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenues in future periods.  If we are unable to sustain KALYDECO net products revenues for any reason, such as safety or efficacy issues, the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products, changes in reimbursement policies of payors  
      
  24 

and other third parties, or adverse legal, administrative, regulatory or legislative developments, our ability to commercialize KALYDECO would be impaired and our product revenues would decrease and our financial position and stock price would be materially harmed. 
  In addition, our success is dependent on our ability to continue to expand the label for KALYDECO and to increase the number of patients eligible and reimbursed for treatment with KALYDECO in the United States and ex-U.S. markets.  In the first quarter of 2016, we expect to initiate a clinical trial for ivacaftor in patients with CF less than two years of age to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on markers of CF disease in young children.  There can be no assurance that the data from this clinical trial will be sufficient to obtain approval for ivacaftor in this patient population.   Additionally, in February 2016, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding our sNDA for ivacaftor for patients with CF two years of age and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations.  The FDA determined that it cannot approve the sNDA in its present form.  While we plan to meet with the FDA regarding the sNDA to determine an appropriate path forward, there can be no assurance that the outcome from these discussions will be sufficient to obtain approval for ivacaftor in this patient population. 
  We have a history of incurring losses, and we cannot predict the extent of our future profitability. 
  We have incurred significant operating losses in each of the last three years.  Our future revenues will be dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize ORKAMBI and on continued sales of KALYDECO.  Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on the extent to which we can increase our revenue and control our costs in order to, among other things, counter any unforeseen difficulties, complications or other unknown factors that may impair future revenue or require additional expenditures.  Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to predict the extent of our future profitability or losses.  As an example, we briefly achieved profitability in 2011 based on strong initial sales of INCIVEK but subsequently returned to incurring losses after experiencing a rapid decline in the number of patients being treated with INCIVEK.  If we are unable to sustain sales of KALYDECO and increase sales of ORKAMBI, we may not achieve and/or sustain profitability. 
  If our competitors bring drugs with superior product profiles to market, our drugs may not be competitive and our revenues could decline. 
  ORKAMBI, KALYDECO and any drugs that we develop in the future may not be able to compete effectively with marketed drugs or new drugs that may be developed by competitors.  There are many other companies developing drugs for the same indications that we are pursuing.  In order to compete successfully in these areas, we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy and/or tolerability, and ease of manufacturing, and gain and maintain market acceptance over competing drugs.  Many of our competitors, including major pharmaceutical companies such as Abbvie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead, Johnson   Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi and Roche, possess substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we possess.  Potential competitors also include other public and private companies, academic institutions, government agencies, other public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.  As an example, we experienced a rapid decline in the number of patients being treated with INCIVEK in 2013 and 2014.  
  Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.  Smaller and other early-stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.  These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
  A number of companies are seeking to identify and develop drug candidates for the treatment of CF, including Concert Pharmaceuticals, Genzyme, which is a division of Sanofi, Novartis, Pfizer, ProQR Therapeutics, PTC Therapeutics, Shire and several private companies.  Our competitors have research and development programs directed at identifying CFTR potentiators, CFTR correctors, ENaC inhibitors and drug candidates with other mechanisms of action or that utilize new therapeutic approaches that seek to address the underlying cause of CF.  Our success in rapidly developing and commercializing KALYDECO and ORKAMBI may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of these potential treatments for CF.  If one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a treatment for patients with CF, our revenues from ORKAMBI, KALYDECO and/or other compounds, if then approved, could face  
      
  25 

competitive pressures.  If one or more competing therapies prove to be superior to our existing products and/or drug candidates for the treatment of CF, our business would be materially adversely affected. 
  If we discover safety issues with any of our products or if we fail to comply with continuing U.S. and applicable foreign regulations, commercialization efforts for the product could be negatively affected, the approved product could lose its approval or sales could be suspended, and our business could be materially harmed. 
  Our products are subject to continuing regulatory oversight, including the review of additional safety information.  Drugs are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained and therefore side-effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated, or were not as prevalent or severe, during pre-approval clinical trials or nonclinical studies.  For example, in December 2012, we updated the INCIVEK label in the United States to include a Boxed Warning stating that fatal and non-fatal serious skin reactions have been reported in patients taking INCIVEK combination treatment.  The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product could negatively affect commercial sales of the product, result in restrictions on the product or lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market.  Each of our two commercial products and our most advanced drug candidates, contain ivacaftor, either alone or in combination with one or more other compounds.  As a result, if either of our products were to experience safety issues, both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, as well as one or more of our drug candidates, may be adversely affected.  The reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or public speculation about such events could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility. 
  If we or our collaborators fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we or our collaborators may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals for specific products, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecutions.  In addition, the manufacturers we engage to make our products and the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made are subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities.  If problems are identified during the review or inspection of these manufacturers or manufacturing facilities, it could result in our inability to use the facility to make our product or a determination that inventories are not safe for commercial sale.  
  If physicians, patients and third-party payors do not accept our drugs, we may be unable to generate significant revenues in future periods. 
  Our drugs may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians and patients.  Effectively marketing our drugs and any of our drug candidates, if approved, requires substantial efforts, both prior to launch and after approval.  Physicians may elect not to prescribe our drugs, and patients may elect not to request or take them, for a variety of reasons including: 
             
    prevalence and severity of adverse side-effects; 
                
    lack of reimbursement availability from third-party payors; 
                
    lower demonstrated efficacy, safety and/or tolerability compared to other drugs; 
                
    lack of cost-effectiveness; 
                
    a decision to wait for the approval of other therapies in development that have significant perceived advantages over our drug; 
                
    convenience and ease of administration; 
                
    other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and 
                
    ineffective sales, marketing and/or distribution support. 
     If our drugs fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues in future periods. 
      
  26 

Government and other third-party payors seek to contain costs of health care through legislative and other means.  If they fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our products, our revenues will be harmed. 
  In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of products depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors.  Third-party payors include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States and the national health care systems in many international markets, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.  The trend in the U.S. health care industry and elsewhere is cost containment and efforts of third-party payors to contain or reduce health care costs that may adversely affect our ability to establish or maintain appropriate prices for our products or any drugs that we may develop and commercialize.  In certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control.  Reimbursement agencies in Europe are often more conservative than those in the United States and the reimbursement process is often slower since reimbursement decisions are made on a country-by-country basis.  In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control as currently exists in Europe.  Moreover, certain presidential candidates in the United States have announced an interest in further regulation of the prices of pharmaceutical products.  The ACA requires discounts under the Medicare drug benefit program and increased the rebates paid by pharmaceutical companies on drugs covered by Medicaid.  The ACA also imposes an annual fee, which increases annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers.  
  In addition, third-party payors attempt to contain health care costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover and the amounts that they will pay for drugs.  As a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products.  We might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products or any other future products to such payors  satisfaction.  Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management s time and our financial and other resources.  Our products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective.  Adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.   
  Reimbursement rates vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost products that already are reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or imperfections in the data used to calculate these rates.  Net prices for products are reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health care programs and privately-negotiated discounts.  While we have implemented policies in an effort to comply with mandated reimbursement rates, the U.S. federal government, state governments and private payors frequently pursue actions against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies alleging that the companies have overstated prices in order to inflate reimbursement rates.  Any such action could adversely affect the pricing of and revenues from our products.  Additionally, in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell products. Some of these proposed and implemented reforms have resulted, or could result, in reduced reimbursement rates for our current or future products, which would adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. 
  Specialty pharmaceuticals are drugs that are prescribed by specialist physicians to treat rare or life-threatening conditions and typically address smaller patient populations.  Each of our products is a specialty pharmaceutical product, and our research and development programs are primarily focused on developing additional specialty pharmaceutical products.  The increasing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, is beginning to generate significant third-party payor interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector.  Government regulations in both non-U.S. and U.S markets could limit the prices that can be charged for our products and may limit our commercial opportunity.  The increasing use of health technology assessments in markets around the world and the financial challenges faced by many governments may lead to significant adverse effects on our business.  
  Any legislation or regulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of drugs from other countries also could reduce the net price we receive for our products. 
      
  27 

If regulatory authorities interpret any of our conduct as being in violation of applicable health care laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws prohibiting off-label promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.  
  We are subject to health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal False Claims Act and the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, laws prohibiting off-label product promotion and other similar laws and regulations both in United States and in non-U.S. markets.  While we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws our business could be materially harmed. 
  The federal anti-kickback law prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the ordering, furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.  The federal statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand, and therefore constrains our marketing practices and our various service arrangements with physicians, including physicians who make clinical decisions to use our products.  Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and courts generally will apply a  one purpose test  and find a violation of the law if any part of the intent in providing the remuneration was to induce referrals, even if it also was intended to compensate for professional services or other legitimate purposes.  
  Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid.  Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the FDA has not approved, known as  off-label  uses, that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered off-label uses; submitting inflated  best price  information to the Medicaid Rebate Program; and certain manufacturing-related violations.  The scope of this and other laws may expand in ways that make compliance more difficult and expensive. 
  Although physicians are permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe products for indications other than those approved by the FDA, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off-label uses.  We market ORKAMBI and KALYDECO to eligible CF patients for whom the applicable product has been approved and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of ORKAMBI and KALYDECO in these patient populations.  These eligible patients represent only a portion of the total patients with CF.  If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute off-label promotion, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities, conduct corrective advertising or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties.  It also is possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.  Even if it is later determined we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters. 
  Also applicable to some of our practices is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters and which also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
  In addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.  Various foreign countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information.  The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business.  We have in the past relied on adherence to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as agreed to and set forth by the  
      
  28 

U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union, which established a means for legitimizing the transfer of personal information by U.S. companies doing business in Europe from the European Economic Area to the United States.  As a result of a recent opinion of the European Union Court of Justice, the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework is now deemed to be an invalid method of compliance with restrictions regarding the transfer of data outside of the European Economic Area.  While we are engaging in efforts to address the implications of this opinion, we may be unsuccessful in these efforts.  Failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by data protection authorities in the European Union and the potential for significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant.  Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business. 
  In recent years, several states and localities have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, health care provider payments and other activities.   Additionally, as part of the ACA, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions.  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of HHS payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals.  We also now have similar reporting obligations in certain European countries and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations has adopted a code that will require us to begin reporting such information throughout the European Union in 2016.  We will also have similar reporting obligations in Australia beginning in 2016.  We expended significant efforts to establish, and are continuing to devote significant resources to maintain and enhance, systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations.  Failure to comply with the reporting requirements would result in significant civil monetary penalties.  The ACA also includes various provisions designed to strengthen significantly fraud and abuse enforcement, such as increased funding for enforcement efforts and the lowering of the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and criminal health care fraud statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. 
  On January 1, 2015, the EMA adopted a new policy on publication of clinical data whereby it will publish clinical reports submitted as part of MAAs for drugs.  The policy applies to all clinical reports submitted after January 1, 2015 and the reports will be released as soon as a decision on the application has been made by the EMA.  While implementation of this policy is ongoing and its full effect on our business is not yet known, the ability of third-parties to review and/or analyze the raw data from our clinical trials may increase the risk of patient confidentiality breaches and could result in enhanced scrutiny of our clinical trials results.  Such scrutiny could result in misconceptions being spread about our drugs and drug candidates, even if the underlying analysis of such review turns out to be flawed.  These publications could also result in the disclosure of information to our competitors that we might otherwise deem confidential, which could harm our competitive position. 
   If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.  The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are subject to a variety of interpretations.  Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business. 
  The sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from governmental entities in the United Sates and other countries in which we market our products, and we believe that this trend will continue.  We have in place policies to govern how we may retain health care professionals as consultants that reflect the current climate on this issue and are providing training on these policies.  Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, also could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business. 
  The increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.  
  Social media increasingly is being used by third parties to communicate about our products and drug candidates and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat.  We believe that members of the CF community may be more active on social media as compared to other patient populations due to the demographics of this patient population.  Social media practices in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business.  For example, patients may use social media platforms to comment on the  
      
  29 

effectiveness of, or adverse experiences with, a drug or a drug candidate, which could result in reporting obligations.  In addition, there is a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website.  If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business. 
  Risks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulation of Our Products and Drug Candidates 
  Our drug candidates remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval.  If we are unable to successfully develop additional drug candidates, and in particular our next-generation CFTR combination regimens, our business will be materially harmed. 
  Our business depends upon the successful development and commercialization of drug candidates.  These drug candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.  To satisfy these standards, we must allocate resources among our various development programs and must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our drug candidates.  Discovery and development efforts for new pharmaceutical products, including new combination therapies, are resource-intensive and may take 10 to 15 years or longer for each drug candidate.  Despite our efforts, our drug candidates may not: 
             
    offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive therapies; 
                
    be proven safe and effective in clinical trials; 
                
    meet applicable regulatory standards; 
                
    be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; or 
                
    if approved for commercial sale, be successfully marketed as pharmaceutical products. 
     We have recently completed and/or have ongoing or planned clinical trials for several of our drug candidates, including drug candidates for the treatment of CF, oncology, pain and neurology.  The strength of our company s product portfolio and pipeline will depend in large part upon the outcomes of these clinical trials and our ability to develop and commercialize combination treatments for CF that include ivacaftor in combination with (i) VX-661 and/or (ii) our next-generation CFTR corrector compounds, including VX-152 and VX-440.  Results of our clinical trials and findings from our nonclinical studies, including toxicology findings in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials, could lead to abrupt changes in our development activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a particular drug candidate or program.  Moreover, clinical data are often susceptible of varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their drug candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their drug candidate.  Furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate. 
  Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including our company, have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage clinical trials.  Accordingly, the results from completed preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials, and ongoing clinical trials for our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later-stage clinical trials or of the likelihood of approval of a drug candidate for commercial sale.  In addition, from time to time we report interim data from our clinical trials.  Interim data from a clinical trial may not be predictive of final results from the clinical trial. 
  If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates. 
  The time required to complete clinical trials and to satisfy the FDA and other countries  regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years.  Our analysis of data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.  We also may encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in governmental policy during the period of drug development, clinical trials and governmental regulatory review. 
  We may seek a fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation for some of our drug candidates.  For example, ivacaftor was granted fast-track designation in the United States and a number of our drugs and drug candidates, including  
      
  30 

ivacaftor and the combination regimens of lumacaftor with ivacaftor and VX-661 with ivacaftor, were designated as breakthrough therapies.  Drug candidates that receive one or both of these designations may be eligible for, among other things, an accelerated regulatory review.  Each of these designations is within the discretion of the FDA.  Accordingly, even if we believe one of our drug candidates meets the criteria for fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation.  The receipt of one or both of these designations for a drug candidate does not guarantee a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA.  In addition, even if one or more of our drugs or drug candidates qualifies for fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the FDA may later decide to withdraw such designation if it determines that the drug or drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification.    
  Any failure to obtain regulatory approvals for a drug candidate would prevent us from commercializing that drug candidate.  Any delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize a drug candidate.  Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a drug may be subject to limitations that we do not expect on the indicated uses for which we may market the drug.  Any such limitations could reduce the size of the market for the drug. 
  We also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement.  Non-U.S. jurisdictions have different approval procedures than those required by the FDA, and these jurisdictions may impose additional testing requirements for our drug candidates.  The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements.  Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States and approval by a foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by the FDA.  In addition, although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to conditions imposed by the FDA.  For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles.  The trial population also must adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful.  In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations.  If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable drug candidate. 
  If clinical trials are prolonged or delayed, our development timelines for the affected development program could be extended, our costs to develop the drug candidate could increase and the competitive position of the drug candidate could be adversely affected. 
  We cannot predict whether or not we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials.  Among the factors that could delay our development programs are: 
             
    ongoing discussions with the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials and the number of clinical trials we must conduct; 
                
    delays in enrolling volunteers or patients into clinical trials, including as a result of low numbers of patients that meet the eligibility criteria for the trial; 
                
    a lower than anticipated retention rate of volunteers or patients in clinical trials; 
                
    the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive results, unforeseen complications in testing or clinical investigator error; 
                
    inadequate supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials; 
                
    unfavorable FDA or foreign regulatory authority inspection and review of a manufacturing facility that supplied clinical trial materials or its relevant manufacturing records or a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation; 
         
  31 

unfavorable scientific results from clinical trials; 
                
    serious and unexpected drug-related side-effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by participants in clinical trials being conducted by our competitors to evaluate drug candidates with similar mechanisms of action or structures to drug candidates that we are developing; 
                
    favorable results in testing of our competitors  drug candidates, or FDA or foreign regulatory authority approval of our competitors  drug candidates; or 
                
    action by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority to place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on a trial or compound or deeming the clinical trial conduct as problematic. 
     Our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis is subject to a number of factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the number of other clinical trials ongoing and competing for patients in the same indication and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial.  In addition, patients may drop out of our clinical trials or may be lost to follow-up medical evaluation after treatment ends, and this could impair the validity or statistical significance of the trials.  Delays in patient enrollment or unforeseen drop-out rates may result in increased costs and longer development times. 
  We, our collaborators, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time if we or they believe the healthy volunteers or patients participating in such clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons.  For example, in July 2013, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on VX-135, a drug candidate we were developing for the treatment of patients with hepatitis C virus infection.  Any such suspension could materially adversely affect the development of a particular drug candidate and our business. 
  If our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to restrictions on marketing our products or could be delayed in submitting regulatory filings seeking approvals for our drug candidates. 
  We have a number of regulated processes and systems that are required to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our drugs and drug candidates.  These processes and systems are subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.  In addition, the clinical research organizations and other third parties that we work with in our non-clinical studies and clinical trials and our oversight of such parties are subject to similar reviews and periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.  If compliance issues are identified at any point in the development and approval process, we may experience delays in filing for regulatory approval for our drug candidates, or delays in obtaining regulatory approval after filing.  Any later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues with approved drugs or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such drugs or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of drugs from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, we are a party to agreements that transfer responsibility for complying with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of marketing authorizations and safety reporting or compliance with manufacturing requirements, to our collaborators and third-party manufacturers.  If our collaborators or third-party manufacturers do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any drugs for which we or they obtain approval may be subject to later restrictions on manufacturing or sale, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  
  Risks Related to Collaborations and other Business Development Activities 
  Our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends in part on our ability to acquire rights to additional drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to add to our pipeline or provide us with new commercial opportunities.  
  In order to achieve our long-term business objectives, our strategy is to supplement our internal pipeline by acquiring rights to additional drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to provide us with new commercial opportunities.  We may not be able to acquire, in-license or otherwise obtain rights to additional drugs, drug candidates or other technologies on acceptable terms or at all.  We have faced and will continue to face significant competition for these types of drugs, drug candidates and other technologies from a variety of other companies with interests in the specialty pharmaceutical marketplace, many of which have significantly more financial resources and experience in business  
      
  32 

development activities than we have.  In addition, non-profit organizations may be willing to provide capital to the companies that control additional drugs, drug candidates or technologies, which may provide incentives for companies to advance these drugs, drug candidates or technologies independently.  Because of these competitive pressures, the cost of acquiring, in-licensing or otherwise obtaining rights to such drugs, drug candidates or other technologies has grown dramatically in recent years and may be at levels that we cannot afford or that we believe are not justified by market potential.  This competition is most intense for approved drugs and late-stage drug candidates, which have the lowest risk and would have the most immediate effect on our financial performance.   
  We may not realize the anticipated benefits of potential acquisitions or licenses to businesses, drugs, drug candidates and other technologies, and the integration following any such acquisition or license may disrupt our business and management. 
  We may acquire a business or the rights to drugs, drug candidates or other technologies.  For example, in 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Parion pursuant to which we exclusively licensed investigational ENaC inhibitors, including VX-371 (formerly P-1037), for the potential treatment of CF and other pulmonary diseases.  We also entered into an agreement with CRISPR to collaborate on the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology.  With respect to each of these transactions and any additional acquisition of a business or rights to drugs, drug candidates or other technologies, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction, each of which involves numerous risks.  These risks include:  
             
    failure to successfully further develop the acquired or licensed drugs or technology or to achieve strategic objectives, including successfully developing and commercializing the drugs, drug candidates or technologies that we acquire or license; 
                
    inadequate or unfavorable data from clinical trials evaluating the acquired or licensed drug or drug candidates; 
                
    entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; 
                
    disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges; 
                
    potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, or acquired or licensed product or technology, including but not limited to, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality, safety, accounting practices, employee, customer or third party relations and other known and unknown liabilities; 
                
    liability for activities of the acquired company or licensor before the acquisition or license, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; 
                
    exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition or license, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former equity holders or other third-parties;  
                
    difficulty in integrating the drugs, drug candidates, technologies, business operations and personnel of an acquired company; and 
                
    difficulties in the integration of the acquired company s departments, systems, including accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related procedures and policies. 
     Acquisitions and licensing arrangements are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete an announced acquisition or license transaction or integrate an acquired business, or an acquired or licensed drug, drug candidate or other technology successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition or license to the extent anticipated and the perception of the effectiveness of our management team and our company may suffer in the marketplace. Additionally, we may later incur impairment charges related to assets acquired in any such transaction.  For example, we  
      
  33 

acquired or licensed several drug candidates for the treatment of HCV infection, but due to adverse clinical data regarding these drug candidates and competitive pressures, we incurred significant costs and impairment charges but did not realize the expected benefits from these transactions.  In addition, even if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income (loss).  Future licenses or acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition. 
  We face risks in connection with existing and future collaborations with respect to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and drug candidates. 
  The risks that we face in connection with our current collaborations, including with Parion and CRISPR, and any future collaborations include the following: 
             
    Our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or may have insufficient resources to effectively develop our drug candidates.  The ability of some of our products and drug candidates to reach their potential could be limited if collaborators decrease or fail to increase development or commercialization efforts related to those products or drug candidates.  Our collaboration agreements provide our collaborators with a level of discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. 
                
    Any future collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties. 
                
    Collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs that are similar to or competitive with the drugs or drug candidates that are the subject of their collaborations with us. 
                
    Disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of drug candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to drug candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration.  Any such disagreements would divert management attention and resources and be time-consuming and expensive. 
                
    Collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation. 
                
    Collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability. 
                
    Investigations and/or compliance or enforcement actions against a collaborator, which may expose us to indirect liability as a result of our partnership with such collaborator. 
                
    Our collaboration agreements are subject to termination under various circumstances. 
     Additionally, if a collaborator were to be involved in a business combination, it might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any drug candidate licensed to it by us.  If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed. 
  We may not be able to attract collaborators or external funding for the development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates. 
  As part of our ongoing strategy, we may seek additional collaborative arrangements or external funding for certain of our development programs and/or seek to expand existing collaborations to cover additional commercialization and/or development activities.  We have a number of research programs and early-stage clinical development programs, some of which are being developed in collaboration with a third party.  For example, in June 2014, we granted Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. an exclusive license to develop and commercialize VX-787, a drug candidate discovered by us for the treatment of influenza.  At any time, we may determine that in order to continue development of a drug candidate or program  
      
  34 

or successfully commercialize a drug we need to identify a collaborator or amend or expand an existing collaboration.  Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of a number of factors.  Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject drug candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such drug candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of the applicable intellectual property, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally.  Potentially, and depending on the circumstances, we may desire that a collaborator either agree to fund portions of a drug development program led by us, or agree to provide all of the funding and directly lead the development and commercialization of a program.  No assurance can be given that any efforts we make to seek additional collaborative arrangements will be successfully completed on a timely basis or at all.  If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  If we are unable to enter into acceptable collaborative relationships, one or more of our development programs could be delayed or terminated and the possibility of our receiving a return on our investment in the program could be impaired. 
  Risks Related to Third-Party Manufacturing and Reliance on Third Parties 
  We depend on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products and the materials we require for our clinical trials.  We may not be able to maintain these relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control.  
  We rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers and in rare circumstances, compounders, to manufacture some of our drugs for commercial use and our drug candidates for clinical trials.  As a result of our reliance on these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, we could be subject to significant supply disruptions outside of our control.  Our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step international endeavor.  Third-party contract manufacturers, including some in China, supply us with raw materials, and convert these raw materials into drug substance and convert the drug substance into final dosage form.  Establishing and managing this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships.  Although we attempt to manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we do not have control over their operations.  Supply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely.  Any supply disruptions could disrupt sales of our products and/or the timing of our clinical trials.  
  We require a supply of ivacaftor and lumacaftor for commercial sale (as KALYDECO and/or ORKAMBI).  We also require a supply of ivacaftor, lumacaftor, VX-661, VX-371, VX-152 and VX-440 and our other drug candidates for use in our clinical trials.  We obtain ivacaftor and lumacaftor (and the combinations thereof) to meet our commercial and clinical supply needs through a third-party manufacturing network.  Our supply chain includes a single-source manufacturer for (i) one step in the ivacaftor manufacturing process and (ii) the manufacture of the oral granule formulation of KALYDECO that is used for patients with CF two to five years of age.  As a result, if these manufacturers become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing product on our behalf and we are not able to promptly identify another manufacturer, we would experience a disruption in the commercial supply of KALYDECO and/or ORKAMBI, which would have a significant effect on patients, our business and our product revenues.  Similarly, a disruption in the clinical supply of drug products could delay the completion of clinical trials and affect timelines for regulatory filings.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish and maintain secondary manufacturers for all of our ivacaftor or lumacaftor supply needs on a timely basis or at all. 
  In the course of providing its services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our products or drug candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us.  This would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have our products or drug candidates manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process. 
      
  35 

We rely on third parties to conduct certain pre-clinical work and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such studies and/or trials or failing to satisfy regulatory requirements. 
  We rely on third parties such as contract research organizations to help manage certain pre-clinical work and our clinical trials and on medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct our clinical trials.  Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities.  For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the clinical trial.  Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good laboratory practices and good clinical practices for conducting, recording and reporting the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected.  If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them.  Although we believe that there are a number of other third-party contractors we could engage to continue these activities, it may result in a delay of the affected clinical trial or drug development program.  If clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements, action by regulatory authorities might significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of these clinical trials or in specific circumstances might result in a requirement that a clinical trial be redone.  Accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates could be delayed. 
  Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
  If our patents do not protect our drugs, or our drugs infringe third-party patents, we could be subject to litigation and substantial liabilities.  
  We have numerous issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States, as well as counterparts in other countries.  Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain and defend U.S. and foreign patents covering our drugs, their uses and our processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.  We cannot be certain that any patents will issue from our pending patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide us with adequate protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable. 
  Due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions.  Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents in the U.S.  The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law.  These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation.  The United States Patent Office developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective in March 2013.  The first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor who is the first to invent an invention but is not the first to file an application claiming that invention.  U.S. and foreign patent applications typically are maintained in confidence for a period of time after they initially are filed with the applicable patent office.  Consequently, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent, or the first to file patent applications on, our products or drug candidates or their use.  If a third party also has filed a U.S. patent application relating to our drugs or drug candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may have to participate in legal or administrative proceedings to determine priority of invention.  For applications governed by the Lahey-Smith Act, if a third-party has an earlier filed U.S. patent application relating to our drugs or drug candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may be unable to obtain an issued patent from our application. 
  The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability.  Our patents may be challenged by third parties, resulting in the patent being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or the third party may circumvent any such issued patents.  Also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents.  Our patents might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies.  For instance, the issued patents relating to our drugs or drug candidates may be limited to a particular molecule or molecules and may not cover similar molecules that have similar clinical properties.  Consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property.  In addition, if the  
      
  36 

breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products. 
  The laws of many foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and many companies in our segment of the pharmaceutical industry have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions.  If we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business could be substantially harmed. 
  Because of the extensive time required for the discovery, development, testing and regulatory review of drug candidates, it is possible that, a patent may expire before a drug candidate can be commercialized, or a patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization of such drug candidate resulting in a minimal, if any, period of patent exclusivity.  To the extent our drug candidates are not commercialized significantly ahead of the expiration date of any applicable patent, or to the extent we have no patent protection on such drug candidates, then, to the extent available we would rely on other forms of exclusivity, such as regulatory exclusivity provided by the FDCA and its counterpart agencies in various jurisdictions, and/or orphan drug exclusivity. 
  Uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable.  
  There is considerable uncertainty within our industry about the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the United States and elsewhere in the world, and, to date, the law and practice remains in substantial flux both in the agencies that grant patents and in the courts.  We cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted as being infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products. 
  There has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation in the industry regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.  Litigation, arbitrations, administrative proceedings and other legal actions with private parties and governmental authorities concerning patents and other intellectual property rights may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management.  Competitors may sue us as a way of delaying the introduction of our drugs or to remove our drugs from the market.  Any litigation, including litigation related to Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDA, interference proceedings to determine priority of inventions, derivations proceedings,   inter partes   review, oppositions to patents in foreign countries, litigation against our collaborators or similar actions, may be costly and time consuming and could harm our business.  We expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights.  Litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products.  Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. 
   To the extent that valid present or future third-party patents or other intellectual property rights cover our drugs, drug candidates or technologies, we or our strategic collaborators may seek licenses or other agreements from the holders of such rights in order to avoid or settle legal claims.  Such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, which may hinder our ability to, or prevent us from being able to, manufacture and market our drugs.  Payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products. 
  We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.  
  Many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors.  Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee s former employer.  Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.  
  In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own.  Our and their  
      
  37 

assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.  
  If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.  Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.  
  Risks Related To Our Operations 
  If we fail to manage our operations effectively, our business may suffer. 
  We have expanded and are continuing to expand our global operations and capabilities, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational, research and development and financial infrastructure.  To effectively manage our business, we need to:  
             
    implement and clearly communicate our corporate-wide strategies; 
                
    enhance our operational and financial infrastructure, including our controls over records and information; 
                
    enhance our operational, financial and management processes, including our cross-functional decision-making processes and our budget prioritization systems; 
                
    train and manage our global employee base; 
                
    transition from a U.S.-centric company into an organization capable of developing and commercializing multiple drug candidates in international markets; and 
                
    enhance our compliance and legal resources. 
     Risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business. 
  We have expanded our international operations over the past several years in order to market KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and expand our research and development capabilities.  In 2015, a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses were associated with our foreign operations and we expect that portion to increase over time.  New laws and industry codes in the European Union and elsewhere have expanded transparency requirements regarding payments and transfers of value as well as patient-level clinical trial data.  New laws in the European Union also have expanded protections related to personal data and provided for increased sanctions for violations.  Collectively, our expansion and these new requirements are adding to our compliance costs and expose us to potential sanctions for failing to meet the enhanced safeguards and reporting demands in these jurisdictions.  In addition, a significant portion of our commercial supply chain, including sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing, is located in China and the European Union.  Consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries.  Risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include:  
             
    differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries; 
                
    collectibility of accounts receivable; 
                
    unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; 
                
    economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; 
                
    differing levels of enforcement and/or recognition of contractual and intellectual property rights; 
                
    complying with local laws and regulations, which are interpreted and enforced differently across jurisdictions and which can change significantly over time; 
                
    foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes; 
         
  38 

foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in reduced revenues or increased operating expenses, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country; 
                
    workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; 
                
    import and export licensing requirements, tariffs, and other trade and travel restrictions; 
                
    production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and 
                
    business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism. 
     Our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations.  Although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful.  As a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways.  
  In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law.  For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad.  In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  We also are subject to import/export control laws.  Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and corresponding bad publicity and negative perception of our company in foreign countries. 
  Our business has a substantial risk of product liability claims.  If we do not obtain appropriate levels of insurance, product liability claims could adversely affect our business. 
  Our business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, clinical testing, manufacturing and sales and marketing of drugs and drug candidates.  We have product liability insurance and clinical trial insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate to cover this risk.  However, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against all potential liabilities.  If a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as pay uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us and these damages could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  Furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity is likely to result. 
  A breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.  
  We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business.  In the course of our business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information.  The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems makes such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches.  A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to both private and governmental causes of action.  While we have implemented security measures in an attempt to minimize these risks to our data and information technology systems and have adopted a business continuity plan to deal with a disruption to our information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business. 
      
  39 

If we fail to attract and retain skilled employees, our business could be materially harmed. 
  Because our drug discovery and development activities are highly technical in nature, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the skills necessary to conduct these activities.  In addition, we need to attract and retain employees with experience in marketing and commercialization of medicines.  We face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors and other companies throughout our industry.  We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions.  Moreover, the growth of local biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the Boston area have increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields, and the high cost of living in Massachusetts makes it difficult to attract employees from other parts of the country to Massachusetts.  Our ability to commercialize our products, and achieve our research and development objectives, depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands.  If we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel, there could be a material adverse effect on our business. 
  The loss of the services of key employees or the failure to effectively integrate key employees could negatively affect our business. 
  Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain the services of our key scientific and management personnel and to integrate new scientific and management personnel into our business.  A loss of key personnel or a failure to properly integrate new personnel could be disruptive.  We have entered into employment agreements with some executives and provide compensation-related benefits to all of our key employees that vest over time and therefore induce them to remain with us.  However, the employment agreements can be terminated by the executive on relatively short notice.  The value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest over time such as options, restricted stock and restricted stock units is significantly affected by movements in our stock price, and may at any point in time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.  A failure to retain, as well as hire, train and effectively integrate into our organization a sufficient number of qualified scientists, professionals, sales personnel and senior management would negatively affect our business. 
  If we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected. 
  Our research and development efforts involve the regulated use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various controlled and radioactive compounds.  Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state, federal and foreign regulations, the risk of loss of, or accidental contamination or injury from, these materials cannot be eliminated.  If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial.  We also are subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials.  Although we maintain workers  compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.  We maintain insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials that we believe is appropriate based on the small amount of hazardous materials we generate.  Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future.  We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations. 
  If our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed. 
  Most of our operations, including our research and development activities, are conducted in a limited number of facilities.  If any of our major facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, due to a fire, earthquake or similar event, our operations could be seriously harmed.  For example, our corporate headquarters, as well as additional leased space that we use for certain logistical and laboratory operations and manufacturing, are located in a flood zone along the Massachusetts coast.  We have adopted a business continuity plan to address most events of a crisis nature.  However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data and/or an inability to perform vital corporate functions, which could result in a significant disruption in our research, development, manufacturing and/or commercial activities, the loss or critical data and/or large expenses to repair or replace the facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.

Risks Related to Holding Our Common Stock 
  Our stock price may fluctuate. 
  Market prices for securities of companies such as ours are highly volatile.  From January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, our common stock traded between   $97.45   and   $143.45   per share.  The market for our stock, like that of other companies in the biotechnology industry, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations.  The future market price of our securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as: 
             
    the information contained in our quarterly earnings releases, including our net product revenues and operating expenses for completed periods and guidance regarding future periods; 
                
    announcements of FDA actions with respect to our drugs or our competitors  drugs, or regulatory filings for our drug candidates or those of our competitors, or announcements of interim or final results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies relating to our drugs, drug candidates or those of our competitors; 
                
    prescription data and other information disclosed by third parties regarding our business or products; 
                
    technological innovations or the introduction of new drugs by our competitors; 
                
    government regulatory action; 
                
    public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or our competitors; 
                
    developments in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to these matters;  
                
    developments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example, relating to intellectual property rights; 
                
    developments relating specifically to other companies and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks or stocks in general; 
                
    business development, capital structuring or financing activities; and 
                
    general worldwide or national economic, political and capital market conditions. 
     Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, and the terms of our credit agreement impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks.  
  In July 2014, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a $300.0 million senior secured term loan.  We are required to repay principal on the loan beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 with us repaying $75.0 million on each of October 1, 2016, January 1, 2017, April 1, 2017 and July 9, 2017. 
  Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse financial, business, economic and industry conditions, as well as other factors that are beyond our control.  In October 2016, we will be required to begin repayment of the principal amount of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of future cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes.  
  The credit agreement requires that we maintain, on a quarterly basis, a minimum level of KALYDECO net revenues.  Further, the credit agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, pay dividends, repurchase capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates.  As a result, we may be restricted from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business.  Failure to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owing under the credit agreement and/or our capital leases and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  
  Additionally, our obligations under the credit agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.  All obligations under the credit agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to  
      
  41 

certain exceptions, by substantially all of our assets and the assets of all guarantors, including the pledge of all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries.  If we fail to satisfy our obligations under the credit agreement or are unable to obtain sufficient funds to make payments, the lenders could foreclose on our pledged collateral. 
  Our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation. 
  Our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future.  Our future revenues will be dependent on the level of net product revenues from sales of ORKAMBI, which is reliant on the number of patients for whom treatment with ORKAMBI is initiated, the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment, patient compliance with the recommended treatment regimen and the level of rebates, chargebacks, discounts and other adjustments to our ORKAMBI gross product revenues.  Additional factors that have caused quarterly fluctuations in recent years include variable amounts of revenues, impairment charges, charges for excess and obsolete inventories, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and the consolidation or deconsolidation of variable interest entities.  We cannot accurately predict our future net product revenues from ORKAMBI and our total net product revenues could vary on a quarterly basis.  Our total net product revenues may be affected by, among other factors, the timing of orders from our significant customers.  Our revenues also are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations.  Although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful.  As a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business may affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways.  Our quarterly results also could be materially affected by significant charges, which may or may not be similar to charges we have experienced in the past.  Most of our operating expenses relate to our research and development activities, do not vary directly with the amount of revenues and are difficult to adjust in the short term.  As a result, if revenues in a particular quarter are below expectations, we are unlikely to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter.  These examples are only illustrative and other risks, including those discussed in these  Risk Factors,  could also cause fluctuations in our reported financial results.  Our operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the results of future periods. 
  We expect that results from our clinical development activities and the clinical development activities of our competitors will continue to be released periodically, and may result in significant volatility in the price of our common stock.  
  Any new information regarding our products and drug candidates or competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates can substantially affect investors  perceptions regarding our future prospects.  We, our collaborators and our competitors periodically provide updates regarding drug development programs, typically through press releases, conference calls and presentations at medical conferences.  These periodic updates often include interim or final results from clinical trials conducted by us or our competitors and/or information about our or our competitors  expectations regarding regulatory filings and submissions as well as future clinical development of our products or drug candidates, competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates.  The timing of the release of information by us regarding our drug development programs is often beyond our control and is influenced by the timing of receipt of data from our clinical trials and by the general preference among pharmaceutical companies to disclose clinical data during medical conferences.  In addition, the information disclosed about our clinical trials, or our competitors  clinical trials, may be based on interim rather than final data that may involve interpretation difficulties and may in any event not accurately predict final results. 
  We could be negatively affected by securities class action complaints. 
  On May 28, 2014, a purported shareholder class action   Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Plan   Trust v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, et al.   was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming us and certain of our current and former officers and directors as defendants.  The lawsuit alleged that we made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact in our disclosures during the period from May 7, 2012 through May 29, 2012, all in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The purported class consists of all persons (excluding defendants) who purchased our common stock between May 7, 2012 and May 29, 2012.  The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys  fees as well as disgorgement of the proceeds from certain individual defendants  sales of our stock.  On October 8, 2014, the Court approved Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Fund as lead plaintiff, and Scott and Scott LLP as lead counsel for the plaintiff and the putative class.  We filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on December 8, 2014 and the plaintiffs filed their opposition to our motion to dismiss on January 22, 2015.  On February 23, 2015, we filed a reply to the plaintiffs  opposition to our motion to dismiss.  The court heard oral argument on our motion to dismiss on March 6, 2015 and took the motion under advisement.  On September 30, 2015, the court granted our motion to dismiss. On October 15, 2015, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal.  
      
  42 

We believe that this action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend the litigation.  This action will take time and money to defend and may distract us from more productive activities.  No assurance can be provided that we will be successful in defending this claim or that insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover any liability under such claims. 
  We could be negatively affected by government investigations.     
  In the third quarter of 2015, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice related to our marketed medicines.  This subpoena requests documents relating primarily to our Good Laboratory Practices in a bioanalytical laboratory.  We are in the process of responding to the subpoena and intend to continue to cooperate.  If we are unable to resolve this matter in a satisfactory manner, our business could be adversely affected. 
  Changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties could affect our future taxable income. 
  A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could materially affect us if we generate taxable income in a future period.  We continue to assess the impact of various tax reform proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties in all jurisdictions where we have operations to determine the potential effect on our business and any assumptions we have made about our future taxable income.  We cannot predict whether any specific proposals will be enacted, the terms of any such proposals or what effect, if any, such proposals would have on our business if they were to be enacted. 
  We may need to raise additional capital that may not be available. 
  We have a history of operating losses and may in the future need to raise additional capital.  We have borrowed $300.0 million under a credit agreement that we entered into in the third quarter of 2014.  In recent periods, we also have received significant proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans, but the amount and timing of future proceeds from employee benefits plans is uncertain.  Any potential public offering, private placement or debt financing may or may not be similar to the transactions that we entered into in the past.  Any debt financing may be on terms that, among other things, include conversion features that could result in dilution to our then-existing security holders and restrict our ability to pay interest and dividends although we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.  Additionally, our pledge of our assets as collateral to secure our obligations under our credit agreement may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing.  Any equity financings would result in dilution to our then-existing security holders.  If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs, including clinical trials, incur significant cash exit costs, or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, drugs or drug candidates.  Based on many factors, including general economic conditions, additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 
  Issuances of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , we had   246.3 million   shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  As of   December 31, 2015  , we also had outstanding options to purchase   11.1 million   shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of   $75.99   per share.  Outstanding vested options are likely to be exercised if the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price, and, in the future, we expect to issue additional options, restricted stock and restricted stock units to directors and employees.  In addition, we may issue additional common stock or restricted securities in the future as part of financing activities or business development activities and any such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our then-existing shareholders.  Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.  The issuance of restricted common stock or common stock upon exercise of any outstanding options would be dilutive, and may cause the market price for a share of our common stock to decline. 
  We have adopted anti-takeover provisions and are subject to Massachusetts corporate laws that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management or effectuate a business combination involving Vertex. 
  Our corporate charter and by-law provisions and Massachusetts state laws may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of Vertex that might be beneficial to us or our security holders.  Our charter provides for staggered terms for the members of the Board of Directors.  Our by-laws grant the directors a right to adjourn annual meetings of shareholders, and certain provisions of our by-laws may be amended only with an 80% shareholder vote.  We may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval and upon such terms  
      
  43 

as our Board of Directors may determine.  The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future.  Massachusetts state law prohibits us from engaging in specified business combinations, unless the combination is approved or consummated in a prescribed manner, and prohibits voting by any shareholder who acquires 20% or more of our voting stock without shareholder approval.  As a result, shareholders or other parties may find it more difficult to remove or replace our current management.  Additionally, one of our collaboration agreements includes a change in control provision that could reduce the potential acquisition price an acquirer is willing to pay or discourage a takeover attempt that may otherwise be viewed as beneficial to shareholders.

             ITEM 1B. 
    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
     We did not receive any written comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the date 180 days before the end of the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   regarding our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that have not been resolved. 
             ITEM 2. 
    PROPERTIES 
     Corporate Headquarters 
  We lease approximately 1.1 million square feet of office and laboratory space at our corporate headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts in two buildings pursuant to two leases that we entered into in May 2011.  The leases commenced in December 2013 and will extend until December 2028.  We have an option to extend the term of the leases for an additional ten years.  In addition, in connection with our relocation to Boston, we entered into a lease in June 2012 for approximately 100,000 square feet of space in the Boston Marine Industrial Park, in close proximity to our corporate headquarters.  We are using this additional space for certain logistical and laboratory operations and manufacturing equipment that will complement the office and laboratory facilities at our corporate headquarters. 
  Existing Facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts 
  We currently lease approximately 290,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at our former Kendall Square facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts that will expire in 2018.  We have subleased approximately 267,000 square feet of the approximately 290,000 square feet of the Kendall Square facility under subleases, each with terms ending in 2018. 
  Additional United States and Worldwide Locations 
  In addition to our facilities in Massachusetts, we lease an aggregate of approximately 275,000 square feet of space.  This includes laboratory and office space to support our research and development organizations in San Diego, California, Montreal, Canada, and Milton Park, Abingdon, England and office space in many of the countries in which we sell our products.  In addition, in December 2015, we entered into a lease for approximately 170,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in a building to be built in San Diego, California.  The lease will commence upon completion of the building, scheduled for the second half of 2017, and will extend for 16 years from the commencement date. 
             ITEM 3. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Plan   Trust v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, et al. 
  On May 28, 2014, a purported shareholder class action   Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Plan   Trust v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, et al.   was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming us and certain of our current and former officers and directors as defendants.  The lawsuit alleged that we made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact in our disclosures during the period from May 7, 2012 through May 29, 2012, all in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The purported class consists of all persons (excluding defendants) who purchased our common stock between  
      
  45 

May 7, 2012 and May 29, 2012.  The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys  fees as well as disgorgement of the proceeds from certain individual defendants  sales of our stock.  On October 8, 2014, the Court approved Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Fund as lead plaintiff, and Scott and Scott LLP as lead counsel for the plaintiff and the putative class.  We filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on December 8, 2014 and the plaintiffs filed their opposition to our motion to dismiss on January 22, 2015.  On February 23, 2015, we filed a reply to the plaintiffs  opposition to our motion to dismiss.  The court heard oral argument on our motion to dismiss on March 6, 2015 and took the motion under advisement. On September 30, 2015, the court granted our motion to dismiss.  On October 15, 2015, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. We believe the claims to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend the litigation.   
  DOJ Subpoena 
  In the third quarter of 2015, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice related to our marketed medicines.  This subpoena requests documents relating primarily to our Good Laboratory Practices in a bioanalytical laboratory.  We are in the process of responding to the subpoena and intend to continue to cooperate.

Dividends 
  We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we currently expect that any future earnings will be retained for use in our business.  Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and applicable law and will depend on various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.  In addition, our credit agreement limits our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock. 
  Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities 
  The table set forth below shows all repurchases of securities by us during the three months ended   December 31, 2015  : 

The repurchases were made under the terms of our Amended and Restated 2006 Stock and Option Plan and Amended and Restated 2013 Stock and Option Plan.  Under these plans, we award shares of restricted stock to our employees that typically are subject to a lapsing right of repurchase by us.  We may exercise this right of repurchase if a restricted stock recipient s service to us is terminated.  If we exercise this right, we are required to repay the purchase price paid by or on behalf of the recipient for the repurchased restricted shares, which typically is the par value per share of $0.01.  Repurchased shares are returned and are available for future awards under the terms of our Amended and Restated 2013 Stock and Option Plan.

ITEM 7. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
     OVERVIEW 
  We are in the business of discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines for serious diseases.  We use precision medicine approaches with the goal of creating transformative medicines for patients in specialty markets.  Our business is focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF, and advancing our research and development programs in other indications, while maintaining our financial strength.  Our two marketed products are ORKAMBI and KALYDECO. 
  In 2012, we obtained approval for, and initiated commercial sales of, KALYDECO (ivacaftor), and in 2015, we obtained approval for, and initiated commercial sales of ORKABMI (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor).  KALYDECO net product revenues have been increasing on an annual basis and ORKAMBI net product revenues commenced in the United States in the second half of 2015.  Our total net product revenues increased by   105%   from   $487.8 million   in   2014   to   $1.0 billion   in   2015  , primarily due to ORKAMBI net product revenues, which commenced in the third quarter of 2015, and an increase in KALYDECO net product revenues.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, our total net product revenues were   $406.6 million  , including   $219.9 million   in ORKAMBI net product revenues and   $180.7 million   in KALYDECO net product revenues.  We expect our net income (loss) and total net product revenues in 2016 will be largely dependent on our ORKAMBI net product revenues in the United States.   
  Cystic Fibrosis  
  ORKAMBI  
  ORKAMBI (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in July 2015 and by the European Commission in November 2015, for the treatment of patients with CF twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or   CFTR,   gene.  We recognized our first net product revenues from ORKAMBI in the second half of 2015.  Our future ORKAMBI net product revenues in the United States will reflect the number of patients for whom treatment with ORKAMBI is initiated, the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment, patient compliance with the recommended treatment regimen and the level of rebates, chargebacks, discounts and other adjustments to our ORKAMBI gross product revenues.  We believe that there currently are approximately 8,500 patients in the United States who are eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI and that as of December 31, 2015 more than 4,500 patients in the United States had started treatment with ORKAMBI.  Following the approval in the European Union in November 2015, we have begun the country-by-country reimbursement approval process.  We believe that there are approximately 12,000 patients with CF twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in Europe. 
  We recently completed the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating ORKAMBI for the treatment of patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  We believe that there are approximately 6,000 patients in the United States and European Union within this patient population.    
  KALYDECO  
  KALYDECO (ivacaftor) was approved in 2012 in the United States and European Union as a treatment for patients with CF six years of age and older who have the G551D mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  Since 2012, we have increased the number of patients who are being treated with KALYDECO in the United States and non-U.S. markets by expanding the label for KALYDECO to include patients with CF who have additional mutations in their   CFTR   gene and to include patients in additional age demographics.  We believe that there are approximately 4,000 patients in North America, Europe and Australia who are currently eligible for treatment with KALYDECO. 
      
  50 

CF Development Programs 
  We have multiple development programs in the field of CF, including: 
             
    VX-661, a corrector compound that we are evaluating in a Phase 3 development program in combination with ivacaftor in multiple CF patient populations who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene; 
                
    VX-371, an investigational epithelial sodium channel, or ENaC, inhibitor, that is being evaluated in a Phase 2 development program and which we exclusively licensed from Parion Sciences, Inc. in 2015; and 
                
    VX-152 and VX-440, two next-generation CFTR corrector compounds that entered Phase 1 clinical trials in the fourth quarter of 2015 and that we plan to evaluate as part of combination treatment regimens. 
     Research and Development 
  We are engaged in a number of other research and mid- and early-stage development programs, including in the areas of oncology, pain and neurology.   
  Oncology 
  We are conducting two Phase 1/2 clinical trials of VX-970, a protein kinase inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related, or ATR, in combination with commonly used DNA-damaging chemotherapies across a range of solid tumor types, including triple negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. We also are in Phase 1 development of VX-803, a second ATR inhibitor, alone and in combination with chemotherapy.  We recently initiated Phase 1 clinical development of VX-984, a third oncology drug candidate, alone and in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.   
  Pain 
  We are developing VX-150 and VX-241, two drug candidates for the treatment of pain.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate VX-150 in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee.  We expect to begin clinical development of VX-241 in the first half of 2016. 
  Acute Spinal Cord Injury  
  We are developing VX-210, a drug candidate for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury, that we exclusively licensed from BioAxone BioSciences, Inc. VX-210 is designed to inhibit a protein known as Rho that blocks neural regeneration after injury.  We expect to initiate a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in the first half of 2016 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX-210 in patients with certain acute cervical spinal cord injuries. 
  Research 
  We plan to continue investing in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines.  We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years.   
  Drug Discovery and Development 
  Discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and can take 10 to 15 years or more.  Potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluations, driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations, designed to generate information concerning efficacy, side-effects, proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product.  Most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into development, and most drug candidates that do advance into development never receive marketing approval.  Because our investments in drug candidates are subject to considerable risks, we closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential.  This process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors. 
      
  51 

If we believe that data from a completed registration program support approval of a drug candidate, we submit an NDA to the FDA requesting approval to market the drug candidate in the United States and seek analogous approvals from comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions.  To obtain approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with evidence gathered in nonclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials that the drug candidate is safe and effective for the disease it is intended to treat and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for the manufacture of the drug candidate are adequate.  The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in deciding whether or not a drug candidate should be granted approval based on the benefits and risks of the drug candidate in the treatment of a particular disease, and could delay, limit or deny regulatory approval.  If regulatory delays are significant or regulatory approval is limited or denied altogether, our financial results and the commercial prospects for the drug candidate involved will be harmed. 
  Regulatory Compliance 
  Our marketing of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations.  We have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems, and through the promotion of a culture of compliance.  Among other laws, regulations and standards, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws, and comparable foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims statutes, and laws prohibiting the promotion of drugs for unapproved or off-label uses.  Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug.  False claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting for payment to third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services.  We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to maintain, administer and expand these compliance programs globally. 
  Reimbursement 
  Sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products are covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations.  We dedicate substantial management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the United States and ex-U.S. markets.  Following the FDA s July 2015 approval of ORKAMBI in the United States, we are engaging in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states.  Following the European Commission s November 2015 approval of ORKAMBI in Europe, we are working to obtain government reimbursement for ORKAMBI on a country-by-country basis, because in many foreign countries patients are unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments.  Consistent with our experience with KALYDECO when it was first approved, we expect reimbursement discussions in ex-U.S. markets may take a significant period of time.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Loss Attributable to   Vertex 
  Comparison of Net Loss Attributable to Vertex   2015   vs.   2014    
  Net   loss   attributable to Vertex was   $556.3 million   in   2015   as compared to a net   loss   attributable to Vertex of   $738.6 million   in   2014  .  Our revenues   increased   significantly in   2015   as compared to   2014   primarily due to ORKAMBI net product revenues, which commenced in the third quarter of 2015, and a   $167.9 million     increase   in KALYDECO net product revenues, partially offset by a   $43.6 million     decrease   in our collaborative revenues.  Our operating costs and expenses   increased   in   2015   as compared to   2014   primarily due to increases in research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses and cost of product revenues, partially offset by decreased restructuring expenses and royalty expenses.  
  Comparison of Net Loss Attributable to Vertex   2014   vs.   2013    
  Net   loss   attributable to Vertex was   $738.6 million   in   2014   as compared to a net   loss   attributable to Vertex of   $445.0 million   in   2013  .  Our revenues   decreased   in   2014   as compared to   2013   due to a   $442.3 million     decrease   in INCIVEK net product revenues, a   $166.1 million     decrease   in collaborative revenues and a   $115.7 million   decrease in royalty revenues, partially offset by a   $92.5 million     increase   in KALYDECO net product revenues.  Our operating costs and expenses   decreased   in   2014   as compared to   2013   primarily due to an intangible asset impairment charge related to VX-222 of   $412.9 million   recorded in   2013   and decreases in cost of product revenues, royalty expenses, research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses.  In 2014, the   $45.2 million   loss reflected in other items, net was primarily due to interest expense associated with the leases for our corporate headquarters.  In 2013 the   $106.4 million   gain reflected in other items, net was primarily due to a benefit from income taxes we recorded related to the VX-222 impairment charge.  The income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2014 and 2013 related to a collaboration with Alios that was terminated in 2014.   
  In 2016, we expect that our net income (loss) will be largely dependent on the level of ORKAMBI net product revenues.   
  Earnings Per Share 
  In   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , net loss attributable to Vertex was   $2.31  ,   $3.14   and   $1.98  , respectively, per diluted share.  In   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , net loss from continuing operations attributable to Vertex was   $2.31  ,   $3.14   and   $2.24  , respectively, per diluted share.  
  Common Shares Outstanding 
  Our shares of outstanding common stock increased from   241.8 million   shares on   December 31, 2014   to   246.3 million   shares on   December 31, 2015   due to our issuance in   2015   of approximately   4.5 million   shares of common stock pursuant to our employee equity programs.  Our shares of outstanding common stock increased from   233.8 million   shares on   December 31, 2013   to   241.8 million   shares on   December 31, 2014   due to our issuance in   2014   of approximately   8.0 million   shares of common stock issued pursuant to our employee equity programs. 
      
  53 

Stock-based Compensation 
  Stock-based compensation expense was   $231.0 million  ,   $177.5 million   and   $126.8 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  Our stock-based compensation expense has been increasing due to the increase in our stock price and the associated increase in the grant-date fair value of equity awards.   
  Revenues 

Product Revenues, Net 

Our total net product revenues increased by   105%   in   2015   as compared to   2014   due to net product revenues from ORKAMBI, which was approved by the FDA in July 2015, and increased KALYDECO net product revenues.  
  In 2015, KALYDECO net product revenues were   $631.7 million  , including   $266.1 million   of net product revenues from ex-U.S. markets, compared to KALYDECO net product revenues of   $463.8 million   in 2014, including   $201.4 million   of net product revenues from ex-U.S. markets.  In 2013, KALYDECO net product revenues were   $371.3 million  , including $154.7 million of net product revenues from ex-U.S. markets.  The   increase  s were primarily due to additional patients being treated with KALYDECO as we completed reimbursement discussions in various jurisdictions and increased the number of patients eligible to receive KALYDECO through label expansions.  We expect KALYDECO net product revenues to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015.   
  ORKAMBI net product revenues increased from   $130.8 million   in the third quarter of 2015 to   $219.9 million   in the fourth quarter of 2015.  As of December 31, 2015, more than 4,500 patients, out of the approximately 8,500 eligible patients, had begun treatment with ORKAMBI in the United States.  We expect ORKAMBI net product revenues to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 as we recognize revenues over a full fiscal year.  We believe that our ORKAMBI revenues in 2016, will be dependent on: 
     the total number of eligible patients in the United States who begin treatment with ORKAMBI; 
     the rate at which additional patients initiate treatment in 2016; 
     the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment; and 
     the compliance rate for patients who remain on treatment. 
  Initially, we expect that our ex-U.S. ORKAMBI net product revenues will be primarily from Germany due to the time it will take to complete the reimbursement discussions in other European countries following ORKAMBI s European approval in the fourth quarter of 2015.   
  INCIVEK net product revenues were   $18.0 million  ,   $24.1 million   and   $466.4 million   in 2015, 2014 and 2013.  We have withdrawn INCIVEK from the market.  We may continue to recognize insignificant INCIVEK revenues in 2016 as we adjust our INCIVEK reserves for rebates, chargebacks and discounts.

Royalty Revenues 
  Our royalty revenues were   $24.0 million  ,   $40.9 million   and   $156.6 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  Since the beginning of 2014, our royalty revenues have consisted of (i) revenues related to a cash payment we received in 2008 when we sold our rights to certain HIV royalties and (ii) revenues related to certain third-party royalties payable by our collaborators on sales of HIV drugs and telaprevir that also result in corresponding royalty expenses.  In 2013, we received significant royalties from Janssen NV based on INCIVO (telaprevir) net product sales.  Our rights to receive royalties on INCIVO sales ended at the beginning of 2014, and Janssen NV currently has a fully-paid license to market INCIVO in its territories, subject to the continued payment of certain third-party royalties.   
    
  Collaborative Revenues 

(1) 2015 includes $2.9 million of revenues related to variable interest entities consolidated for accounting purposes. 
  Our collaborative revenues have fluctuated significantly on an annual basis and may continue to fluctuate in the future.   In 2015, we did not have significant collaborative revenues.  In   2014  , the majority of our collaborative revenues related to   $35.0 million   in payments we received from Janssen Inc. related to our outlicense of VX-787.  In   2013  , we recognized   $203.4 million   in Janssen NV collaborative revenues, which were primarily attributable to a   $152.0 million   payment we received pursuant to our amendment to the Janssen NV collaboration agreement.  These collaborative revenues also included the acceleration of the remaining deferred revenues related to the up-front payment we received from Janssen NV in 2006.  
  Operating Costs and Expenses 

Cost of Product Revenues 
  Our cost of product revenues includes the cost of producing inventories that corresponded to product revenues for the reporting period, plus the third-party royalties payable on our net sales of our products.  Pursuant to our agreement with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated, or CFFT, our tiered third-party royalties on sales of KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, calculated as a percentage of net sales, range from the single digits to the sub-teens.  
  Our cost of product revenues   increased   in   2015   as compared to   2014   due primarily to increased net product revenues.  Our cost of product revenues   decreased   in   2014   as compared to   2013   due primarily to decreased net product revenues and the charges incurred in 2013 for excess and obsolete INCIVEK inventories.  We expect our cost of product revenues to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to increased net product revenues. 
      
  55 

Royalty Expenses 
  Royalty expenses include third-party royalties payable upon net sales of telaprevir by our collaborators in their territories and expenses related to a subroyalty payable to a third party on net sales of an HIV protease inhibitor sold by GlaxoSmithKline.  Royalty expenses do not include royalties we pay to CFFT on sales of KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, which instead are included in cost of product revenues.  Royalty expenses in   2015     decreased   by   $13.9 million  , or   65%  , as compared to   2014  , primarily as a result of decreased INCIVO (telaprevir) sales by our collaborator Janssen NV.  Our royalty expenses with respect to telaprevir and the HIV protease inhibitor are offset by corresponding royalty revenues.  
  Research and Development Expenses 

Our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our drugs and drug candidates.  We do not assign our internal costs, such as salary and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs, to individual drugs or drug candidates, because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs.  These internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs, such as the costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research, which we allocate by individual program.  All research and development costs for our drugs and drug candidates are expensed as incurred. 
  Over the past three years, we have incurred   $2.7 billion   in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development.  The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks.  In addition, the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidate and the disease indication being targeted.  The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures.  Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities.  Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible of varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.  The duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict.  Therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available.  
  In   2013  ,   2014   and   2015  , costs related to our CF programs represented the largest portion of our development costs.  Any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change.  In 2015, we obtained approval for ORKAMBI in the United States and Europe, and began generating revenues from ORKAMBI in the United States in the second half of 2015.  We cannot make a meaningful estimate when, if ever, our other clinical development programs will generate revenues and cash flows. 
      
  56 

Research Expenses 

Over the past three years we have maintained a substantial investment in research activities resulting in increases in research expenses.  Our research expenses in 2015 included a one-time   $75.0 million   upfront payment we made to CRISPR Therapeutics AG, or CRISPR, in connection with entry into our collaboration in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Excluding the upfront payment we made to CRISPR, our research expenses increased by   2%   in 2015 as compared to 2014.  We expect to continue to invest in our research programs with a focus on identifying drug candidates with the goal of creating transformative medicines. 
  Development Expenses 

Our development expenses   increased   by   $60.1 million  , or   10%  , in   2015   as compared to   2014   and   decreased   by   $50.4 million  , or   8%  , in   2014   as compared to   2013  .  The   increase   in   2015   as compared to   2014   was primarily due to an increase in outsourced services related to ongoing clinical trials, including our Phase 3 development program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor and an increase in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by decreased infrastructure costs and decreased laboratory supplies and other direct expenses.  We expect our development expenses to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to activities related to clinical trials, including the Phase 3 clinical development program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor. 
  The   decreased   development expenses in   2014   as compared to   2013   were principally due to decreased outsourced services expenses and drug supply costs, partially offset by increased stock-based compensation expense.  The significant decrease in outsourced services expenses in 2014 was largely attributable to decreased clinical trial expenses resulting from the completion of the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT clinical trials in the first half of 2014.   
      
  57 

Sales, General and Administrative Expenses 

Sales, general and administrative expenses   increased   by   23%   in   2015   as compared to   2014  , primarily due to increased investment in commercial support for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO and costs incurred to prepare for the launch of ORKAMBI in ex-U.S. markets.  Sales, general and administrative expenses   decreased   by   14%   in   2014   as compared to   2013  , primarily due to decreased headcount following our October 2013 restructuring activities.  We expect sales, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to the continued expansion of our commercial infrastructure to support sales of ORKAMBI.    
  Restructuring Expense 
  In   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , we recorded restructuring expenses of   $2.2 million  ,   $50.9 million   and   $40.5 million  , respectively.  Our restructuring expenses in 2014 primarily related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Massachusetts to Boston from Cambridge.  Our restructuring expenses in 2013 primarily related to our October 2013 reduction in headcount.  As of   December 31, 2015  , our accrued restructuring liability related to our lease obligation in Cambridge was   $13.9 million  .  This lease obligation expires on April 30, 2018. 
  Intangible Asset Impairment Charges 
  In 2013, we recorded a   $412.9 million   impairment charge related to VX-222, a non-nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitor.  In connection with this impairment charge, we recorded a credit of $127.6 million in our provision for income taxes, resulting in a net effect on net loss attributable to Vertex related to this impairment charge of $285.3 million in 2013.  There were no corresponding intangible asset impairment charges recorded related to continuing operations in 2014 or 2015. 
  In 2013, we also recorded a   $250.6 million   impairment charge related to the Alios HCV nucleotide analogue program and a benefit for income taxes of   $102.1 million   that is included in loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest for 2013.   
  Other Items, Net 
  Interest Expense, Net 
  In   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , interest expense, net was   $84.2 million  ,   $72.9 million   and   $22.9 million  , respectively.  The increase in interest expense, net in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the interest expense we incurred for the full fiscal year in 2015 on the $300.0 million that we borrowed in mid-2014 pursuant to our credit agreement.  The   increase   in interest expense in   2014   as compared to   2013   was primarily due to interest expense of $60.2 million associated with the leases for our corporate headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts and interest expense of $10.4 million related to the $300.0 million we borrowed in mid-2014. 
  Other (Expense) Income, Net 
  In   2015  ,   net other expense   was   $6.7 million   primarily due to foreign exchange losses.  In   2014  , we recorded   net other income   of   $30.4 million   primarily due to a credit of $36.7 million related to a one-time cash payment we received in 2014 from our landlord pursuant to leases for our corporate headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts.  In   2013  , we recorded   net other income   of   $6.9 million   primarily related to foreign exchange gains. 
  Income Taxes 
  In   2015  , we recorded a   provision for   income taxes of   $30.4 million  , principally due to the consolidation of Parion as a VIE into our consolidated financial statements in the second quarter of 2015.  In   2014  , we recorded a   provision for   income taxes of   $7.0 million  , of which approximately $3.9 million was due to the consolidation of BioAxone as a VIE into our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2014.  In   2013  , our   benefit from   income taxes was   $122.4 million  .   
      
  58 

This   benefit from   income taxes was primarily due to a   benefit   of   $127.6 million   related to our impairment charge for the VX-222 intangible asset. 
  Discontinued Operations 
  In 2014, we recorded a loss from discontinued operations attributable to Vertex of $0.9 million.  In 2013, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $58.6 million.  Our income (losses) from discontinued operations in these periods related to gains and losses due to the deconsolidation of Alios, an intangible asset impairment charge, a benefit from income taxes related to this charge and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration we estimated Alios would receive under the collaboration agreement.  For additional information regarding the Alios collaboration please refer to  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Collaborations; Variable Interest Entities.  
    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  As of December 31,   2015  , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately   $1.04 billion  , which represented an increase of   $26.0 million   from   $1.02 billion   as of June 30, 2015 and   a decrease   of   $344.6 million   from approximately   $1.39 billion   as of December 31,   2014  .   
  In the second half of 2015, we maintained our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance due to increased cash receipts from product sales together with   $97.7 million   in cash we received from issuances of common stock pursuant to our employee benefit plans, offset by cash expenditures in the second half of 2015 related to, among other things, research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses and an aggregate of $105.0 million in payments, including an equity investment, in connection with entry into our collaboration agreement with CRISPR in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  The   decrease   in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 was due to cash expenditures we made during   2015   related to, among other things, research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses, an $80.0 million payment to Parion in connection with entering into our collaboration agreement with Parion and an aggregate of $105.0 million in payments to CRISPR, including an equity investment, in connection with entry into our collaboration agreement with CRISPR, partially offset by cash receipts from product sales and   $185.6 million   in cash we received from issuances of common stock pursuant to our employee benefit plans.  We also incurred   $41.6 million   in costs for capital expenditures including net cash flows from capital lease financing during   2015  .  
  Our future cash flows will be substantially dependent on product sales of KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. 
  Sources of Liquidity 
  We intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity.  We are receiving cash flows from sales of ORKAMBI in the United States and from sales of KALYDECO in both in the United States and ex-U.S. markets.  We expect to begin receiving cash flows from sales of ORKAMBI in Europe beginning in the first half of 2016.  Initially, we expect these cash flows will be primarily from Germany due to the time it will take to complete the reimbursement discussions in other European countries.   
  We borrowed $300.0 million under a credit agreement that we entered into in July 2014 and, subject to certain conditions, we may request up to an additional $200.0 million pursuant to that credit agreement.  In recent periods, we also have received significant proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans, but the amount and timing of future proceeds from employee benefits plans is uncertain.  Other possible sources of liquidity include strategic collaborative agreements that include research and/or development funding, commercial debt, public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, development milestones and royalties on sales of products, software and equipment leases, strategic sales of assets or businesses and financial transactions.  Negative covenants in our credit agreement may prohibit or limit our ability to access these sources of liquidity. 
  Future Capital Requirements 
  We incur substantial operating expenses to conduct research and development activities and to operate our organization.  Under the terms of our credit agreement, we are required to repay the principal amount on the $300.0 million we borrowed in July 2014 in installments of $75 million on each of October 1, 2016, January 1, 2017, April 1, 2017 and July 9, 2017.  We also have substantial facility and capital lease obligations, including leases for two buildings in Boston, Massachusetts that  
      
  59 

continue through 2028.  In addition, we have entered into certain collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research, development and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental and regulatory targets.   
  We expect that cash flows from ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, together with our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.  The adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the amount of future revenues generated by ORKAMBI and KALYDECO and the potential introduction of one or more of our other drug candidates to the market, the level of our business development activities and the number, breadth, cost and prospects of our research and development programs. 
  Financing Strategy 
  In July 2014, we borrowed $300.0 million pursuant to a credit agreement.  In addition, subject to certain conditions, we may request that the lenders loan us up to an additional $200.0 million under the credit agreement.  We may raise additional capital through public offerings or private placements of our securities or securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing.  We will continue to manage our capital structure and will consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile.  Negative covenants in our credit agreement may prohibit our ability to obtain future financing and there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 
    CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS 
  The following table sets forth our commitments and obligations as of   December 31, 2015  :   

Leases 
  We lease two buildings that are located at Fan Pier in Boston, Massachusetts.  We commenced lease payments on these two buildings in December 2013 and the initial lease periods end in December 2028. 
  On December 2, 2015, we entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to lease approximately 170,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in a building to be built in San Diego, California.  The lease will commence upon completion of the building, scheduled for the second half of 2017 and will extend for 16 years from the commencement date.  The future minimum rental payments that we are obligated to pay after taking occupancy are included in  Facility leases, excluding Fan Pier Leases.  
  Our future minimum commitments under our Kendall Square lease are included in  Facility leases, excluding Fan Pier Leases.   We have entered into three subleases for a portion of the rentable square footage at the Kendall Square facility to offset our on-going contractual lease obligations.  The future minimum committed income from the subleases is   $15.5 million   for   2016   and   $20.7 million   total for   2017   and   2018  .  These amounts are not offset against our obligations set forth in the table above.  
  The table also reflects leases of equipment, leasehold improvements and software licenses that are accounted for as capital leases.  
      
  60 

Senior Secured Term Loan 
  In July 2014, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a   $300.0 million   senior secured term loan.  The term loan currently bears interest at 6.2% per annum and will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 5.0% per annum during the third year of the term.  We are required to repay principal on the term loan in quarterly installments of $75 million from October 1, 2016 through the maturity date.  We include estimates for interest in  Senior secured term loan,  which are equivalent to management s expectations for the probable outcome of variable interest rates that are dependent on various future events and market interest rates.  
  Research, Development and Drug Supply Costs 
   Research, development and drug supply costs,  does not include certain payments we are obligated to make to clinical research organizations, or CROs, because these contracts are cancelable, at our option, with notice.  However, we historically have not cancelled such contracts.  As of   December 31, 2015  , we had accrued   $30.6 million   related to these contracts for costs incurred for services provided through   December 31, 2015  , and we have approximately   $197.1 million   in cancelable future commitments based on existing contracts as of   December 31, 2015  .  These amounts reflect planned expenditures based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. 
  Collaborative Arrangements 
  We have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets.  Our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events that could cause the discontinuance of the programs.  Pursuant to our collaboration with BioAxone, BioAxone has the potential to receive up to $90.0 million, including a license continuation fee and development and regulatory milestone payments; and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on future product sales, if any.  Pursuant to our collaboration with Parion, Parion has the potential to receive milestone and royalty payments, including up to $490.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments for the development of VX-371 (formerly P-1037) and/or VX-551 (formerly P-1055) to treat CF.  Pursuant to our collaboration with CRISPR, CRISPR has the potential to receive milestone and royalty payments, including up to $420.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments for each of up to six targets pursuant to the collaboration.  We also have royalty obligations and a remaining $13.9 million milestone payment to the CFFT that we expect to pay in 2016.  Contingent payments under these agreements become due and payable only upon achievement of certain milestones and are not included in the contractual obligations table above.   
  Tax-related Obligations 
  We exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.  As of   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.  As of   December 31, 2015  , we cannot reasonably estimate the amount we expect to pay within the next twelve months in connection with such settlements. 
  Other Funding Commitments 
  Our table detailing contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance payment obligations to certain of our executive officers in the event of a not-for-cause employment termination under existing employment contracts.  We provide information regarding these obligations annually in our proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders. 
    
    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods.  These items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future.   
      
  61 

Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which the change occurs.  We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. 
  We believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results: 
             
    revenue recognition; 
                
    intangible assets; 
                
    collaborations and variable interest entities; 
                
    research and development accruals; 
                
    commercial supplies and inventories; 
                
    income taxes;  
                
    leases;  
                
    restructuring expenses; and 
                
    stock-based compensation expense. 
     Our accounting policies, including the ones discussed below, are more fully described in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements, including   Note A,  Nature of Business and Accounting Policies,    included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Product Revenues, Net 
  We generate product revenues from sales in the United States and in international markets.  We sell our products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy providers and selected regional wholesalers in North America as well as government-owned and supported customers in international markets, collectively, our customers.  Our customers in North America subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers.  We contract with government agencies and various private organizations so that our products will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors.  We recognize net product revenues from sales of our products upon delivery to our customers as long as: 
             
    there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists between us and our customer; 
                
    collectability is reasonably assured; and 
                
    the price is fixed or determinable. 
     In order to conclude that the price is fixed or determinable, we must be able to calculate our gross product revenues from our customers and reasonably estimate our net product revenues.  Our gross product revenues are based on the fixed price for our products that we charge our customers.  We estimate our net product revenues by deducting from our gross product revenues (i) trade allowances, such as invoice discounts for prompt payment and customer fees, (ii) estimated government and private payor rebates, chargebacks and discounts, (iii) estimated reserves for expected product returns and (iv) estimated costs of incentives offered to certain indirect customers, including patients.  We make significant estimates and judgments that materially affect our recognition of net product revenues.  Changes in our estimates of net product revenues could have a material effect on net product revenues recorded in the period in which we determine that change occurs.  
  In certain instances, we may be unable to reasonably conclude that the price is fixed or determinable at the time of delivery, in which case we defer the recognition of revenues.  Once we are able to determine that the price is fixed or determinable, we recognize the revenues associated with the units in which revenue recognition was deferred. 
  The value of the rebates, chargebacks and discounts provided to third-party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government-mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third-party payors.  In order  
      
  62 

to estimate our total rebates, chargebacks and discounts, we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third-party payor, which is referred to as the payor mix.  We track available information regarding changes, if any, to the payor mix for our products, to our contractual terms with third-party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel.  We adjust our estimated rebates, chargebacks and discounts based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates, chargebacks and discounts for our products, as it becomes available.  Claims by third-party payors for rebates, chargebacks and discounts frequently are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known.  
  We have withdrawn INCIVEK from the market in the United States.  At December 31,2015 the Company maintains an accrual of less than   $1 million   for government rebates for INCIVEK.  There typically is no deadline by which government payors must submit claims, and as a result we are continuing to monitor this reserve.  Adjustments to this reserve are reflected as either an increase or decrease to net product revenues in the period in which the adjustment is made.    
  Our customers generally have the right to return unopened unprescribed packages subject to contractual limitations.  To date returns have been minimal and, based on inventory levels held by our customers and our distribution model, we believe that returns of products will continue to be minimal.  We track actual returns by individual production lots and will continue to monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel.  If necessary, we will adjust our estimated product returns based on new information as it becomes available. 
  Collaborative Revenues 
  We recognize revenues generated through collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreements.  The terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: nonrefundable, up-front license fees; development and commercial milestone payments; funding of research and/or development activities; payments for services we provide through our third-party manufacturing network; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.  Each of these types of payments results in collaborative revenues, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenues. 
  For each collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreement that results in revenues, we determine (i) whether multiple deliverables exist, (ii) whether the undelivered elements have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, (iii) how the deliverables should be separated and (iv) how the consideration should be allocated to the deliverables. For arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011, we allocate consideration in an arrangement using the relative selling price method based on our best estimate of selling price of deliverables if we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence.  As part of the accounting for these agreements, we must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the best estimate of selling price.  We utilize key assumptions to determine the best estimate of selling price, which may include patient enrollment requirements from regulatory authorities, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates, and estimated third-party development costs.   
   In the fourth quarter of 2013, we amended our collaboration agreement with Janssen NV, and were required to make significant estimates regarding (i) the determination of whether or not the agreement was materially modified and (ii) the estimated selling price for the remaining telaprevir development activities.  We recognized   $182.4 million   of collaborative revenues pursuant to the collaboration agreement in the fourth quarter of 2013.  This amount was primarily attributable to (i) the new consideration received from Janssen NV, including the   $152.0 million   fourth quarter 2013 payment and the remaining deferred revenues related to the 2006 up-front payment less (ii) our best estimate of selling price for the remaining telaprevir development activities.  As of December 31,   2015  , the remaining deferred revenue balance related to Janssen NV was not material.  
  Intangible Assets  
  We maintain an indefinite-lived in-process research and development asset on our consolidated balance sheet until either the research and development project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired.  When we determine that an asset has become impaired or we abandon a project, we write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and take an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs.  
  We assess the fair value of assets, including intangible assets such as in-process research and development assets, using a variety of methods, including present-value models that are based upon multiple probability-weighted scenarios involving the development and potential commercialization of the acquired drug candidates.  The present-value models require us to make  
      
  63 

significant assumptions regarding the estimates that market participants would make in evaluating a drug candidate, including the probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval to market the drug candidate, the timing of and the expected costs to complete in-process research and development projects, future net cash flows from potential drug sales, which are based on estimates of the sales price of the drug, the number of patients who will be diagnosed and treated and our competitive position in the marketplace, and appropriate discount and tax rates. 
  We test our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist.  Events that could result in an impairment, or trigger an interim impairment assessment, include the receipt of additional clinical or nonclinical data regarding our drug candidate or a potentially competitive drug candidate, changes in the clinical development program for a drug candidate or new information regarding potential sales for the drug.  In connection with each annual impairment assessment and any interim impairment assessment, we compare the fair value of the asset as of the date of the assessment with the carrying value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet.  
  In 2013, we incurred intangible asset impairment charges of   $412.9 million   and   $250.6 million   related to continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively, that related to drug candidates for the treatment of HCV infection.  As of December 31,   2015  , we had   $284.3 million   of indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet related to our VIEs.   
  Collaborations; Variable Interest Entities 
  Our collaborations require us to apply accounting policies that involve significant judgments and that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.  Under applicable accounting guidance, as a result of the relationships established through collaboration agreements, our collaborators may be deemed to be variable interest entities, or VIEs, our licenses may result in a variable interest in collaborators as a whole and our being the primary beneficiary of VIEs.  As a result, we are required to consolidate VIEs financial statements into our financial statements for the period during which we have a variable interest in the VIE and are the VIE s primary beneficiary, and if we later determine that we no longer have a variable interest or are no longer the primary beneficiary, we are required to deconsolidate the VIE.   If we determine that we no longer have significant continuing involvement with a VIE, its operations and direct expenses incurred by us are reflected in our discontinued operations presentation. 
  In addition, each period our net loss (income) is adjusted for gains and losses in the fair value of the contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to our VIEs.  Determining the fair value of the contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to VIEs requires us to make significant estimates regarding the probability and potential timing of achieving each of the milestones pursuant to the agreement, future potential net sales and appropriate discount and tax rates.  
  We believe that the following effects of the consolidation and deconsolidation of VIEs on our consolidated financial statements are the most significant: 
             
    Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, we are consolidating all of Parion s expenses and revenues into our consolidated statements of operations, eliminating all intercompany balances and transactions.  As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated balance sheet includes Parion s balances. 
                
    Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, we are consolidating all of BioAxone s expenses and revenues into our consolidated statements of operations, eliminating all intercompany balances and transactions.  As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated balance sheet includes BioAxone s balances. 
                
    As of September 30, 2014, we concluded that we no longer had significant continuing involvement with Alios due to our intent and ability to terminate the Alios Agreement, which we terminated during the fourth quarter of 2014; therefore, the operations of Alios, including collaboration expenses reimbursed by Vertex are presented as discontinued operations for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. 
                
    In 2013, the deconsolidation of Alios resulted in a gain of   $68.2 million   attributable to Vertex.  The   $68.2 million   gain was approximately equal to the difference between (i) losses we recorded in 2011 and 2012 based on increases in the fair value of contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to Alios and (ii) the aggregate of   $120.0 million   in up-front and milestone payments that we made to Alios pursuant to the Alios collaboration.    
         
  64 

In 2013, we recorded net loss (income) attributable to the Alios noncontrolling interest.  This net loss (income) attributable to the Alios noncontrolling interest is included in loss from discontinued operations for 2013.   
     Research and Development Accruals 
  Research and development expenses, including amounts funded through research and development collaborations, are expensed as incurred.  When third-party service providers  billing terms do not coincide with our period-end, we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs, costs for drug supply, marketing expenses and infrastructure expenses incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period.  We base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, experience with related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable. 
  Commercial Supplies and Inventories  
  We began capitalizing the costs of our KALYDECO inventories on January 1, 2012 and the costs of our ORKAMBI inventories on July 1, 2014.  We capitalize inventories produced in preparation for initiating sales of a drug candidate when the related drug candidate is considered to have a high likelihood of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through sale of the inventories.  In determining whether or not to capitalize such inventories, we evaluate, among other factors, information regarding the drug candidate s safety and efficacy, the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial sales, including the existence of current or anticipated competitive drugs and the availability of reimbursement.  In addition, we evaluate risks associated with manufacturing the drug candidate and the remaining shelf life of the inventories.  After we begin capitalizing inventories, we perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, and write down any excess and obsolete inventories to their net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. 
  In 2013, following periodic assessments of the recoverability of our inventories, we recorded within cost of product revenues an aggregate of   $10.4 million   in charges primarily related to excess and obsolete INCIVEK inventories based on our analysis of our inventory levels in relation to our commercial outlook for INCIVEK.  As of December 31, 2015, all of our inventories are related to KALYDECO and ORKAMBI.  Periodic assessments of the recoverability of capitalized costs involve significant estimates and judgments on the part of management.  
  Income Taxes 
  We maintain a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets because we have an extended history of annual losses.  Our U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled approximately   $4.2 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  .  On an annual basis, we reassess the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets.  After consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset as of   December 31, 2015   because it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  In future periods, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized, (i) the valuation allowance would be decreased, (ii) a portion or all of the deferred tax asset would be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and (iii) we would record non-cash benefits in our consolidated statements of operations related to the reflection of the deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet. 
  Leases 
  In 2011, we entered into two leases for our corporate headquarters.  Our corporate headquarters were built during the period from 2011 through December 2013.  We lease our corporate headquarters pursuant to leases that expire in 2028, subject to our right to extend the leases for an additional 10 years.  Because we were involved in the construction project, we were deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the buildings during the construction period.  Accordingly, we recorded project construction costs incurred by the landlord as an asset and a related financing obligation in  Property and equipment, net  and  Construction financing lease obligation,  respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. 
  Upon completion of the construction of the buildings, we evaluated the leases and determined that the leases did not meet the criteria for  sale-leaseback  treatment.  Accordingly, we depreciate the asset and incur interest expense related to the financing obligation recorded on our balance sheet.  We bifurcate our lease payments pursuant to the leases into (i) a portion that is allocated to the buildings and (ii) a portion that is allocated to the land on which the buildings were constructed.  The portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land is treated as an operating lease.  In connection with the leases for our  
      
  65 

corporate headquarters, we incurred   $60.2 million   in interest expense,   $13.3 million   in depreciation expense and   $6.5 million   in operating expense in 2015.  In   2016  , we expect interest expense, depreciation expense and operating expenses related to the leases for our corporate headquarters to be approximately consistent with that from 2015. 
  Restructuring Expenses 
  We have adopted several plans to restructure our facility operations for which we have incurred restructuring expenses in the three years ended December 31, 2015.  In particular, in 2014, we recorded   $50.9 million   in costs associated with exit and disposal activities related to the relocation of our headquarters in Massachusetts from Cambridge to Boston and maintained a liability related to these activities of   $6.0 million   as of December 31, 2015.  Our initial estimate of our liabilities for net ongoing costs associated with these facility obligations are recorded at fair value.  In estimating the expenses and liabilities related to these facilities, we utilize probability-weighted discounted cash-flows of our ongoing lease obligations.  In estimating the expense and liability under our lease obligations, we estimate (i) the costs to be incurred to satisfy rental and build-out commitments under the lease (including operating costs), (ii) the lead-time necessary to sublease the space, (iii) the projected sublease rental rates and (iv) the anticipated durations of subleases.  We use a credit-adjusted risk-free rate to discount the estimated cash flows. 
  We review our estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis.  We intend to continue such reviews until the termination of these facility lease obligations and will make whatever modifications we believe are necessary, based on our best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances.  Our estimates have changed in the past, and may change in the future, resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of these liabilities.  Changes to our estimate of these liabilities are recorded as additional restructuring expenses (credits).  In addition, because our estimate of these liabilities includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time-value of money, we record imputed interest costs related to these liabilities each quarter.  These costs are included in restructuring expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. 
  Stock-based Compensation Expense 
  Stock-based compensation expense is determined based on the fair value of the equity award at the grant date, net of estimated forfeitures, and is adjusted each period to reflect actual forfeitures and the outcomes of certain performance conditions.  For awards with performance conditions that accelerate vesting of the award, we estimate the likelihood of satisfaction of the performance conditions, which affects the period over which the expense is recognized, and recognize the expense using the accelerated attribution model.  For awards with performance conditions in which the award does not vest unless the performance condition is met, we recognize expense only if we estimate that achievement of the performance condition is probable.  If we conclude that vesting is probable, we recognize expense from the date that we reach this conclusion through the estimated vesting date.  Since 2014, we have provided to employees who have rendered a certain number of years of service and meet certain age requirements, partial or full acceleration of vesting of their equity awards, subject to certain conditions including a notification period, upon a termination of employment other than for cause.  If actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates, if our estimates regarding the employees who will be eligible for partial or full acceleration of their equity awards, if the likelihood of achievement of a performance conditions changes or if any of our other assumptions or estimates prove incorrect, our stock-based compensation expense, or the period over which our stock-based compensation is recognized, could be materially affected.  
    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
  Refer to   Note A,  Nature of Business and Accounting Policies,    in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.  There were no new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2015 that had a material effect on our financial statements.  
             ITEM 7A. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     As part of our investment portfolio, we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks.  The investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations, including our research and development activities.  None of these market risk-sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes.  We do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. 
      
  66 

Interest Rate Risk 
  We invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments, principally securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, investment-grade corporate bonds and commercial paper, and money market funds.  These investments are denominated in U.S. dollars.  All of our interest-bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate.  Substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity, and we have implemented guidelines limiting the term-to-maturity of our investment instruments.  Due to the conservative nature of these instruments, we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk. 
  Foreign Exchange Market Risk 
  As a result of our foreign operations, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, Swiss Franc, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar against the U.S. dollar.  The current exposures arise primarily from cash, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables, payables and inventories.  Both positive and negative affects to our net revenues from international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural, opposite affect that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating costs and expenses. 
  We have a foreign currency management program with the objective of reducing the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies.  The change in fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and the gross fair value of foreign currency forward assets and liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 were not material.

             ITEM 9A. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     (1)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    The Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and the Company s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
  (2)  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.    The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
             
    pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
         
  67 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
                
    provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  .  In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)(COSO).  Based on its assessment, the Company s management has concluded that, as of   December 31, 2015  , the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 
  The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst   Young LLP, issued an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  See Section 4 below. 
  (3)  Changes in Internal Controls.    During the quarter ended   December 31, 2015  , there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

(4)  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 
  We have audited Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated s internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  , based on the COSO criteria. 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders  equity and noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2015   of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and our report dated   February 16, 2016   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
             A. 
    Nature of Business and Accounting Policies 
     Business 
  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated ( Vertex  or the  Company ) is in the business of discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines for serious diseases.  The Company uses precision medicine approaches with the goal of creating transformative medicines for patients in specialty markets.  The Company is focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis ( CF ) and advancing its research and development programs.  The Company has marketed KALYDECO (ivacaftor) since it was approved in 2012 for the treatment of certain patients with CF.  The Company began marketing ORKAMBI (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor)     in the United States in 2015.  In November 2015, the European Commission approved ORKAMBI, and the Company is seeking country-by-country reimbursement for ORKAMBI in Europe.  
  The Company s net loss attributable to Vertex for   2015   was   $556.3 million  , or   $2.31   per share.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of   $1.04 billion  .  The Company expects that cash flows from the sales of its products, together with the Company s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months. 
  Vertex is subject to risks common to companies in its industry including, but not limited to, the dependence on revenues from ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, competition, uncertainty about clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals, uncertainties relating to pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement, rapid technological change, uncertain protection of proprietary technology, the need to comply with government regulations, share price volatility, dependence on collaborative relationships and potential product liability. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of (i) the Company, (ii) its wholly-owned subsidiaries and (iii) consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs).  In addition, the consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of Alios BioPharma, Inc. ( Alios ), as well as direct expenses Vertex incurred as a result of the Alios Agreement, as discontinued operations.  All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company operates in   one   segment, pharmaceuticals.  Please refer to   Note T,  Segment Information,    for enterprise-wide disclosures regarding the Company s revenues, major customers and long-lived assets by geographic area. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods.  Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements have been made in connection with the calculation of revenues, inventories, research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense, the fair value of intangible assets, goodwill, contingent consideration, noncontrolling interest, the consolidation of VIEs and deconsolidation of a VIE, leases, the fair value of cash flow hedges and the provision for or benefit from income taxes.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions, including in certain circumstances future projections, that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Product Revenues, Net 
  The Company sells its products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy providers and selected regional wholesalers in North America as well as government-owned and supported customers in international markets (collectively, its  Customers ).  The Company s Customers in North America subsequently resell the products to patients and health care

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

providers.  The Company recognizes net revenues from product sales upon delivery as long as (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists between the Company and the Customer, (ii) collectibility is reasonably assured and (iii) the price is fixed or determinable. 
  In order to conclude that the price is fixed or determinable, the Company must be able to (i) calculate its gross product revenues from sales to Customers and (ii) reasonably estimate its net product revenues upon delivery to its Customer s locations.  The Company calculates gross product revenues based on the price that the Company charges its Customers.  The Company estimates its net product revenues by deducting from its gross product revenues (a) trade allowances, such as invoice discounts for prompt payment and Customer fees, (b) estimated government and private payor rebates, chargebacks and discounts, (c) estimated reserves for expected product returns and (d) estimated costs of incentives offered to certain indirect customers, including patients.   
  The Company makes significant estimates and judgments that materially affect the Company s recognition of net product revenues.  In certain instances, the Company may be unable to reasonably conclude that the price is fixed or determinable at the time of delivery, in which case it defers the recognition of revenues.  Once the Company is able to determine that the price is fixed or determinable, it recognizes the revenues associated with the units in which revenue recognition was deferred. 
  Trade Allowances:    The Company generally provides invoice discounts on product sales to its Customers for prompt payment and pays fees for distribution services, such as fees for certain data that Customers provide to the Company.  The payment terms for sales to Customers in the United States generally include a discount for payment within 30 days.  The Company expects that, based on its experience, its Customers will earn these discounts and fees, and deducts the full amount of these discounts and fees from its gross product revenues and accounts receivable at the time such revenues are recognized. 
  Rebates, Chargebacks and Discounts:    The Company contracts with government agencies and various private organizations (collectively, its  Third-party Payors ) so that products will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such Third-party Payors.  The Company estimates the rebates, chargebacks and discounts it will provide to Third-party Payors and deducts these estimated amounts from its gross product revenues at the time the revenues are recognized.  For each product, the Company estimates the aggregate rebates, chargebacks and discounts that it will provide to Third-party Payors based upon (i) the Company s contracts with these Third-party Payors, (ii) the government-mandated discounts applicable to government-funded programs, (iii) information obtained from the Company s Customers and other third-party data regarding the payor mix for such product and (iv) historical experience. 
  Product Returns:    The Company estimates the amount of each product that will be returned and deducts these estimated amounts from its gross revenues at the time the revenues are recognized.  The Company s Customers have the right to return unopened unprescribed packages, subject to contractual limitations.  To date product returns have been minimal and, based on inventory levels held by its Customers and its distribution model, the Company believes that returns of its products will continue to be minimal.  
  Other Incentives:    Other incentives that the Company offers include co-pay mitigation rebates provided by the Company to commercially insured patients who have coverage and who reside in states that permit co-pay mitigation programs.  The Company s co-pay mitigation programs are intended to reduce each participating patient s portion of the financial responsibility for a product s purchase price to a specified dollar amount.  Based upon the terms of the Company s co-pay mitigation programs, the Company estimates average co-pay mitigation amounts for each of its products in order to establish its accruals for co-pay mitigation rebates and deducts these estimated amounts from its gross product revenues at the later of the date (i) the revenues are recognized or (ii) the incentive is offered.  The Company s co-pay mitigation rebates are subject to expiration.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The following table summarizes activity in each of the product revenue allowance and reserve categories for the three years ended   December 31, 2015  : 

The Company adjusts its estimated rebates, chargebacks and discounts based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates, chargebacks and discounts for its products, as it becomes available.  Claims by third-party payors for rebates, chargebacks and discounts frequently are submitted to the Company significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known.  In each of the periods presented, the Company s adjustments relating to prior period sales principally related to the Company s estimates for INCIVEK.  During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company withdrew INCIVEK from the market in the United States.  At December 31, 2015 the Company maintains an accrual of less than   $1 million   for government rebates for INCIVEK.   
  Royalty Revenues 
  The Company s royalty revenues on commercial sales of INCIVO (telaprevir) by Janssen NV were based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by Janssen NV.  The Company recognizes royalty revenues in the period the sales occur.   
  The Company has sold its rights to receive certain royalties on sales of an HIV protease inhibitor (fosamprenavir) and recognizes the revenues related to this sale as royalty revenues.  In the circumstance where the Company has sold its rights to future royalties under a license agreement and also maintains continuing involvement in the royalty arrangement (but not significant continuing involvement in the generation of the cash flows payable to the purchaser of the future royalty rights), the Company defers recognition of the proceeds it receives for the royalty stream and recognizes these deferred revenues over the life of the license agreement pursuant to the units-of-revenue method.  The Company s estimates regarding the estimated remaining royalty payments due to the purchaser have changed in the past and may change in the future. 
  Collaborative Revenues 
  The Company recognizes revenues generated through collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreements.  The terms of these agreements typically include payment to the Company of one or more of the following:  
      
  F-9 

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

nonrefundable, up-front license fees; development and commercial milestone payments; funding of research and/or development activities; payments for services the Company provides through its third-party manufacturing network; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.  Each of these types of payments results in collaborative revenues, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenues. 
  For each collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreement that result in revenues, the Company determines (i) whether multiple deliverables exist, (ii) whether the undelivered elements have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, (iii) how the deliverables should be separated and (iv) how the consideration should be allocated to the deliverables.  For arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011, the Company allocates consideration in an arrangement using the relative selling price method based on management s best estimate of selling price of deliverables if it does not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence.  As part of the accounting for these agreements, the Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the best estimate of selling price.  Key assumptions utilized by the Company to determine the best estimate of selling price may include forecasted revenues, patient enrollment requirements from regulatory authorities, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates, and estimated third-party development costs.   
  The Company evaluates amendments to its existing arrangements to determine whether they have been materially modified.  In making its determination that an arrangement has been materially modified, the Company considers whether there have been significant changes to the consideration under the arrangement, the deliverables under the arrangement, the timing of deliverables and the period of the arrangement.  If the arrangement is determined to have been materially modified, the Company allocates fixed consideration under the arrangement using its best estimate of selling price to the remaining undelivered elements at the date of material modification.  Any consideration remaining after the allocation is recognized as revenue. 
  Collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreements entered into prior to January 1, 2011 that contained multiple elements of revenue were divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria were met, including whether the delivered element had stand-alone value to the collaborator and whether there was objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered obligation(s).  The Company allocated consideration it received among the separate units either on the basis of each unit s fair value or using the residual method, and applied the revenue recognition criteria to each of the separate units. 
  Up-front License Fees:    If the license to the Company s intellectual property was determined to have stand-alone value from the other deliverables identified in the arrangement, the Company recognized revenues from nonrefundable, up-front license fees upon delivery.  If these licenses did not have stand-alone value, the Company recognized revenues from nonrefundable, up-front license fees on a straight-line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance.  The Company evaluates the period of performance each reporting period and adjusts the period of performance on a prospective basis if there are changes to be made.  
  Milestone Payments:    At the inception of each agreement that included research and development milestone payments, the Company evaluated whether each milestone was substantive.  The Company recognized revenues related to substantive milestones in full in the period in which the substantive milestone is achieved if payment is reasonably assured.  If a milestone is not considered substantive, the Company recognized the applicable milestone payment over the period of performance.  
  Research and Development Activities/Manufacturing Services:    If the Company was entitled to reimbursement from its collaborators for specified research and development expenses and/or was entitled to payments for specified manufacturing services that the Company provided through its third-party manufacturing network, the Company determines whether the research and development funding would result in collaborative revenues or an offset to research and development expenses in accordance with the provisions of gross or net revenue presentation.   
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of money market funds and marketable securities.  The Company places these investments with highly rated financial institutions, and, by policy, limits the amounts of credit exposure to any one financial institution.  These amounts at times may exceed  
      
  F-10 

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

federally insured limits.  The Company also maintains a foreign currency hedging program that includes foreign currency forward contracts with several counterparties.  The Company has not experienced any credit losses related to these financial instruments and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk related to these instruments.  
  The Company also is subject to credit risk from its accounts receivable related to its product sales and collaborators.  The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of each of its customers and has determined that all of its material customers are creditworthy.  To date, the Company has not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of its accounts receivable.  The Company s receivables from Greece, Italy and Spain were not material at December 31, 2015, and the Company had   no   receivables from Portugal in 2015.  The Company believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate at   December 31, 2015  .  Please refer to   Note T,  Segment Information,    for further information. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of   three   months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.  
  Marketable Securities 
  The Company s marketable securities consist of investments in government-sponsored enterprise securities, corporate debt securities and commercial paper that are classified as available-for-sale.  The Company classifies marketable securities available to fund current operations as current assets on its consolidated balance sheets.  Marketable securities are classified as long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets if (i) they have been in an unrealized loss position for longer than one year and (ii) the Company has the ability and intent to hold them (a) until the carrying value is recovered and (b) such holding period may be longer than one year.  The Company s marketable securities are stated at fair value with their unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate component of shareholders  equity, until such gains and losses are realized.  The fair value of these securities is based on quoted prices for identical or similar assets.   
  The Company reviews investments in marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairment whenever the fair value of an investment is less than the amortized cost and evidence indicates that an investment s carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time.  To determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has an intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment s amortized cost basis.  Evidence considered in this assessment includes reasons for the impairment, compliance with the Company s investment policy, the severity and the duration of the impairment and changes in value subsequent to year-end.  If a decline in the fair value is considered other-than-temporary, based on available evidence, the unrealized loss is transferred from other comprehensive income (loss) to the consolidated statements of operations.   
  Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  
  Accounts Receivable    
  The Company deducts trade allowances for prompt payment and fees for distribution services from its accounts receivable based on its experience that the Company s Customers will earn these discounts and fees.  The Company s estimates for its allowance for doubtful accounts, which have not been significant to date, are determined based on existing contractual payment terms and historical payment patterns.  
  Stock-based Compensation Expense 
  The Company expenses the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based employee compensation over the associated employee service period on a straight-line basis.  Stock-based compensation expense is determined based on the fair value of the award at the grant date, net of estimated forfeitures, and is adjusted each period to reflect actual forfeitures and the outcomes of certain performance conditions.   
      
  F-11 

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

For awards with performance conditions that accelerate vesting of the award, the Company estimates the likelihood of satisfaction of the performance conditions, which affects the period over which the expense is recognized, and recognizes the expense using the accelerated attribution model.  For awards with performance conditions in which the award does not vest unless the performance condition is met, the Company recognizes expense only if the Company estimates that achievement of the performance condition is probable.  If the Company concludes that vesting is probable, it recognizes expense from the date it reaches this conclusion through the estimated vesting date. 
  Effective for equity awards granted on or after February 5, 2014, the Company provides to employees who have rendered a certain number of years  to the Company and meet certain age requirements, partial or full acceleration of vesting of these equity awards, subject to certain conditions including a notification period, upon a termination of employment other than for cause.  Less than   5%   of the Company s employees were eligible for partial or full acceleration of any of their equity awards as of December 31, 2015.  The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to these awards over a service period reflecting qualified employees eligibility for partial or full acceleration of vesting. 
  Research and Development Expenses 
  The Company expenses as incurred all research and development expenses, including amounts funded by research and development collaborations.  The Company capitalizes nonrefundable advance payments made by the Company for research and development activities and expenses the payments as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. 
  Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred by the Company in performing research and development activities, including salary and benefits; stock-based compensation expense; laboratory supplies and other direct expenses; outsourced services, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs; expenses associated with drug supplies that are not being capitalized; and infrastructure costs, including facilities costs and depreciation expense. 
  Advertising Expenses 
  The Company expenses the costs of advertising, including promotional expenses, as incurred.  Advertising expenses, recorded in sales, general and administrative expenses, were   $24.5 million  ,   $16.2 million   and   $19.6 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  Inventories 
  The Company values its inventories at the lower-of-cost or market.  The Company determines the cost of its inventories, which includes amounts related to materials and manufacturing overhead, on a first-in, first-out basis.  The Company performs an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, and writes down any excess and obsolete inventories to their realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified.  Shipping and handling costs incurred for inventory purchases are capitalized and recorded upon sale in cost of product revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.  Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are recorded as incurred in cost of product revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  The Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for initiating sales of a drug candidate when the related drug candidate is considered to have a high likelihood of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through sales of the inventories.  In determining whether or not to capitalize such inventories, the Company evaluates, among other factors, information regarding the drug candidate s safety and efficacy, the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial sales, including the existence of current or anticipated competitive drugs and the availability of reimbursement.  In addition, the Company evaluates risks associated with manufacturing the drug candidate and the remaining shelf-life of the inventories.   
  Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally   seven   to   ten   years for furniture and equipment,   three   to   five   years for computers and software,   40   years for buildings and for leasehold improvements, the shorter of the useful life of the  
      
  F-12 

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

improvements or the estimated remaining life of the associated lease.  Amortization expense of assets acquired under capital leases is included in depreciation expense.  Maintenance and repairs to an asset that do not improve or extend its life are charged to operations.  When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.  The Company performs an assessment of the fair value of the assets if indicators of impairment are identified during a reporting period and records the assets at the lower of the net book value or the fair value of the assets. 
  The Company capitalizes internal costs incurred to develop software for internal use during the application development stage.  The Company expenses costs related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development of software for internal use as these costs are incurred.  Maintenance and enhancement costs (including costs in the post-implementation stages) are expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the software resulting in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized.  Amortization of capitalized internally developed software costs is recorded in depreciation expense over the useful life of the related asset. 
  The Company records certain construction costs incurred by a landlord as an asset and a corresponding financing obligation on the Company s consolidated balance sheets when the Company is determined to be the owner of the buildings during construction for accounting purposes.  Upon completion of the project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if the Company can remove the assets from its consolidated balance sheet. 
  Capital Leases 
  The assets and liabilities associated with capital lease agreements are recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease agreement.  The assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the useful life of the related asset or the remaining life of the associated lease.  Amortization of assets that the Company leases pursuant to a capital lease is included in depreciation expense.  The Company performs an assessment of the fair value of the assets if indicators of impairment are identified during a reporting period and records the assets at the lower of the net book value or the fair value of the assets.  Assets recorded under capital leases are recorded within  Property and equipment, net  and liabilities related to those assets are recorded within  Capital lease obligations, current portion  and  Capital lease obligations, excluding current portion  on the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  
  Income Taxes     
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the income tax bases of assets and liabilities.  A valuation allowance is applied against any net deferred tax asset if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
  The Company records liabilities related to uncertain tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  The Company does not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Variable Interest Entities 
  The Company reviews each collaboration agreement pursuant to which the Company licenses assets owned by a collaborator in order to determine whether or not the collaborator is a VIE.  If the collaborator is a VIE, the Company assesses whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary of that VIE based on a number of factors, including (i) which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE s economic performance, (ii) the parties  contractual rights and responsibilities pursuant to the collaboration agreement and (iii) which party has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE.  If the Company determines it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the onset of the collaboration agreement, the collaboration is treated as a business combination and the Company consolidates the financial statements of the VIE into the Company s consolidated financial statements.  The Company evaluates whether it continues to be the primary beneficiary of any consolidated VIEs on a quarterly basis.  If the Company determines that it is no longer the primary beneficiary of a consolidated VIE, or no longer has a variable interest in the VIE, it deconsolidates the VIE in the period that the determination is made. 
  Assets recorded as a result of consolidating VIEs  financial condition into the Company s consolidated balance sheet do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against the Company s general assets.  The Company records the cash and cash equivalents of consolidated VIEs as restricted cash because the Company does not have control over the VIEs  cash and cash equivalents.  The Company also has recorded the liabilities of its consolidated VIEs for which creditors do not have recourse to the Company s general assets outside of the VIE. 
  Business Combinations 
  The Company assigns the value of consideration, including contingent consideration, transferred in business combinations to the appropriate accounts on the Company s consolidated balance sheet based on their fair value as of the effective date of the transaction.  If a collaboration has been treated as a business combination and there are contingent payments, changes in the fair value of the contingent payments pursuant to collaborations accounted for as business combinations result in an increase or decrease in net income attributable to Vertex (or an increase or decrease in net loss attributable to Vertex) on a dollar-for-dollar basis.  Transaction costs and any restructuring costs associated with these transactions are expensed as incurred. 
  Fair Value of In-process Research and Development Assets and Contingent Payments in Business Combinations 
  The present-value models used to estimate the fair values of research and development assets and contingent payments pursuant to collaborations incorporate significant assumptions, including: assumptions regarding the probability of obtaining marketing approval and/or achieving relevant development milestones for a drug candidate; estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs to develop a drug candidate; estimates of future cash flows from potential product sales and/or the potential to achieve certain commercial milestones with respect to a drug candidate; and the appropriate discount and tax rates.  
  In-process Research and Development Assets 
  The Company records the fair value of in-process research and development assets as of the transaction date of a business combination.  Each of these assets is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and is maintained on the Company s consolidated balance sheet until either the project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired.  If the asset becomes impaired or is abandoned, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is written down to its fair value, and an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs.  If a project is completed, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is amortized as a part of cost of product revenues over the remaining estimated life of the asset beginning in the period in which the project is completed.  In-process research and development assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.   
      
  F-14 

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Goodwill 
  The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is allocated to goodwill.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.   
  Noncontrolling Interest 
  The Company records noncontrolling interest, which has historically related to consolidated VIEs, on its consolidated balance sheets.  Noncontrolling interest is reflected on two separate lines if the consolidated VIE has both common shareholders and preferred shareholders that are entitled to redemption rights in certain circumstances.  The Company records net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest on its consolidated statements of operations, reflecting the VIEs  net loss (income) for the reporting period, adjusted for changes in the fair value of contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by the Company to the consolidated VIEs, which is evaluated each reporting period. 
  Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations 
  Upon the occurrence of certain events and on a regular basis, the Company evaluates whether it no longer has a controlling financial interest in its subsidiaries, including deemed subsidiaries such as consolidated VIEs.  If the Company determines it no longer has a controlling interest, the subsidiary is deconsolidated.  The Company records a gain or loss on deconsolidation based on the difference on the deconsolidation date between (i) the aggregate of (a) the fair value of any consideration received, (b) the fair value of any retained noncontrolling investment in the former subsidiary and (c) the carrying amount of any noncontrolling interest in the subsidiary being deconsolidated, less (ii) the carrying amount of the former subsidiary s assets and liabilities.  
  The Company assesses whether a deconsolidation is required to be presented as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements on the deconsolidation date.  This assessment is based on whether or not the deconsolidation represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company s operations or financial results.  If the Company determines that a deconsolidation requires presentation as a discontinued operation on the deconsolidation date, or at any point during the one year period following such date, it will present the former subsidiary as a discontinued operation in current and comparative period financial statements. 
  Derivative Instruments, Embedded Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
  The Company has entered into financial transactions involving free-standing derivative instruments and embedded derivatives in the past.  Embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated from the host instruments if the derivatives are not clearly and closely related to the host instruments.  The Company determines the fair value of each derivative instrument or embedded derivative that is identified on the date of issuance and at the end of each quarterly period.  The estimates of the fair value of the derivatives include significant assumptions regarding the estimates market participants would make in order to evaluate these derivatives.   
  The Company recognizes the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to GAAP, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments are recorded each period in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as unrealized gains and losses until the forecasted underlying transaction occurs.  Unrealized gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are included in (i)  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  and (ii)  Other liabilities, current portion,  respectively, on the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  Realized gains and losses for the effective portion of such contracts are recognized in  Product revenues, net  in the consolidated statement of operations when the contract is settled with the counterparty.  The Company classifies the cash flows from hedging instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items.   
  Certain of the Company s hedging instruments are subject to master netting arrangements to reduce the risk arising from such transactions with its counterparties.  The Company presents unrealized gains and losses on its foreign currency forward contracts on a gross basis within its consolidated balance sheets.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The Company assesses, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the foreign currency forward contracts used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the hedged items.  The Company also assesses hedge ineffectiveness quarterly and, if determined to be ineffective, records the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to earnings in  Other income (expense), net  in its consolidated statements of operations.  
  Restructuring Expenses 
  The Company records costs and liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred.  In periods subsequent to the initial measurement, the Company measures changes to the liability using the credit-adjusted risk-free discount rate applied in the initial period.  The Company evaluates and adjusts these liabilities as appropriate for changes in circumstances at least on a quarterly basis.   
  Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), which includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts and certain marketable securities.  For purposes of comprehensive income (loss) disclosures, the Company does not record tax provisions or benefits related to the cumulative translation adjustment, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. 
  Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions 
  The Company primarily operates with entities that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.  Non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries have assets and liabilities translated into U.S. dollars at rates of exchange in effect at the end of the year.  Revenue and expense amounts are translated using the average exchange rates for the period.  Net unrealized gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate component of shareholders  equity.  Included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are net unrealized losses related to foreign currency translation of   $2.1 million  ,   $1.0 million   and   $0.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  ,   2014  , and   2013  , respectively.  Net foreign currency exchange transaction gains or losses are included in  net loss  on the Company s consolidated statement of operations.  Net transaction losses were   $6.8 million   and   $6.4 million   for   2015   and   2014  , respectively, and net transaction gains were   $5.1 million   in   2013  . 
  Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Vertex Common Shareholders 
  Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders are presented in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities.  Under the two-class method, earnings are allocated to (i) Vertex common shares, excluding unvested restricted stock, and (ii) participating securities, based on their respective weighted-average shares outstanding for the period.  Shares of unvested restricted stock granted under the Company s Amended and Restated 2006 Stock and Option Plan have the non-forfeitable right to receive dividends on an equal basis with other outstanding common stock.  As a result, these unvested shares of restricted stock are considered participating securities under the two-class method.  Potentially dilutive shares result from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options (the proceeds of which are then assumed to have been used to repurchase outstanding stock using the treasury stock method) and the assumed conversion of convertible notes. 
  Basic net loss per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding restricted stock that has been issued but is not yet vested.  Diluted net loss per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus additional weighted-average common equivalent shares outstanding during the period when the effect is dilutive. 
  The Company utilizes income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Vertex to determine whether potentially outstanding stock options and the assumed conversion of convertible notes are dilutive.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amended guidance applicable to revenue recognition that will be effective for the year ending December 31, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted for the year-ending December 31, 2017.  The new guidance applies a more principle based approach to recognizing revenue.  The new guidance must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented or a modified retrospective approach.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the new guidance and determining the expected effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating whether or not there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued each reporting period.  This new accounting guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company expects the new guidance will only effect the disclosures in its consolidated financial statements. 
  In 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance applicable to the presentation of financial statements and property, plant, and equipment.  The amendment provides guidance for the recognition and disclosure of discontinued operations.  The amendment is effective for the current fiscal year.  The adoption of amended guidance did not have an effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance applicable to the presentation of income taxes.  The amended guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than being separated into current and noncurrent.  This amendment represents a change in accounting principle and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim period within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company early adopted the amendment on a prospective basis and did not retrospectively adjust prior periods.  As a result, all of the Company s deferred taxes are presented as long-term in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015. 
             B. 
    Collaborative Arrangements 
     Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated 
  In April 2011, the Company entered into an amendment (the  April 2011 Amendment ) to its existing collaboration agreement with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ( CFFT ) pursuant to which CFFT agreed to provide financial support for (i) development activities for VX-661, a compound that targets the processing and trafficking defect of the F508del CFTR proteins discovered under the collaboration, and (ii) additional research and development activities directed at discovering new compounds targeting the processing and trafficking defect of the F508del protein.  
  Under the April 2011 Amendment, CFFT agreed to provide the Company with up to   $75.0 million   in funding over approximately   five   years for corrector-compound research and development activities.  The Company retains the right to develop and commercialize KALYDECO (ivacaftor), ORKAMBI (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor), lumacaftor and VX-661.  The Company recognized collaborative revenues from this collaboration of   $6.5 million   and   $14.3 million   in   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  During   2015  , the Company recognized   zero   collaborative revenues from this collaboration. 
  In the original agreement, as amended prior to the April 2011 Amendment, the Company agreed to pay CFFT tiered royalties calculated as a percentage, ranging from single digits to sub-teens, of annual net sales of any approved drugs first synthesized or tested during the research term that ended in 2008, including ivacaftor, lumacaftor and VX-661.  The April 2011 Amendment provides for a tiered royalty in the same range on net sales of corrector compounds first synthesized or tested during the research term that ended in February 2014.  In each of 2012 and 2013, CFFT earned a commercial milestone payment of   $9.3 million   from the Company upon achievement of certain sales levels for KALYDECO.  There are no additional commercial milestone payments payable by the Company to CFFT related to sales levels for KALYDECO. In the fourth quarter of 2015, CFFT earned the first commercial milestone payment of   $13.9 million   from the Company upon achievement of certain sales levels of lumacaftor.  The Company expects that in the first quarter of 2016, CFFT will earn the second and final commercial milestone of   $13.9 million   based upon achievement of certain sales levels of lumacaftor.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The Company began marketing KALYDECO in the United States and certain countries in the European Union in 2012 and began marketing ORKAMBI in the United States in 2015. The Company received approval for ORKAMBI in the European Union in 2015.  The Company has royalty obligations to CFFT for ivacaftor, lumacaftor and VX-661 until the expiration of patents covering that compound.  The Company has patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of ivacaftor that expire in 2027 and 2025, respectively, subject to potential patent extensions.  The Company has patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of lumacaftor that expire in 2030 and 2026, respectively, subject to potential extension.  The Company has patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of VX-661 that expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively, subject to potential extension.  
  CRISPR Therapeutics AG 
  On October 26, 2015, the Company entered into a strategic collaboration, option and license agreement (the  CRISPR Agreement ) with CRISPR Therapeutics AG and its affiliates ( CRISPR ) to collaborate on the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology.  The Company has the exclusive right to license up to six CRISPR-Cas9-based targets.  In connection with the CRISPR Agreement, the Company made an upfront payment to CRISPR of   $75.0 million   and a   $30.0 million   investment in CRISPR pursuant to a convertible loan agreement that converted into preferred stock in January 2016.  The Company expensed   $75.0 million   to research and development, and the   $30.0 million   investment was recorded at cost and is classified as a long-term asset on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. 
  The Company will fund all of the discovery activities conducted pursuant to the CRISPR Agreement.  For potential hemoglobinapathy treatments, including treatments for sickle cell disease, the Company and CRISPR will share equally all research and development costs and worldwide revenues.  For other targets that the Company elects to license, the Company would lead all development and global commercialization activities.  For each of up to   six   targets that the Company elects to license, other than hemoglobinapathy targets, CRISPR has the potential to receive up to   $420.0 million   in development, regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties on net product sales.   
  The Company may terminate the CRISPR Agreement upon   90   days  notice to CRISPR prior to any product receiving marketing approval or upon   270   days  notice after a product has received marketing approval.  The CRISPR Agreement also may be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions.  Unless earlier terminated, the CRISPR Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the Company s payment obligations under the CRISPR Agreement. 
  Janssen Pharmaceutica NV 
  The Company has a collaboration agreement (the  Janssen HCV Agreement ) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV ( Janssen NV ) for the development, manufacture and commercialization of telaprevir, which Janssen NV began marketing under the brand name INCIVO in certain of its territories in September 2011.  Pursuant to the Janssen HCV Agreement, as amended, Janssen NV has a fully-paid license to manufacture and commercialize INCIVO in its territories including Europe, South America, the Middle East, Africa and Australia, subject to the payment of third-party royalties on net sales of INCIVO.  In addition to the collaborative revenues, the Company recorded royalty revenues and corresponding royalty expenses related to third-party royalties that Janssen NV remains responsible for based on INCIVO net sales.

During the three years ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company recognized the following revenues attributable to the Janssen HCV collaboration: 

Variable Interest Entities (VIE) 
  The Company has entered into several agreements pursuant to which it has licensed rights to certain drug candidates from third-party collaborators, which has resulted in the consolidation of the third parties  financial statements into the Company s consolidated financial statements as VIEs.  In order to account for the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments related to these collaborations under GAAP, the Company uses present-value models based on (i) assumptions regarding the probability of achieving the relevant milestones, (ii) estimates regarding the time to develop the drug candidates, (iii) estimates of future product sales and (iv) appropriate discount rates.  The Company bases its estimate of the probability of achieving the relevant milestones on industry data for similar assets and its own experience.  The discount rates used in the valuation model represent a measure of credit risk and market risk associated with settling the liabilities.  Significant judgment is used in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions at each reporting period.  Changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments.  The following collaborations are, or were previously, reflected in the Company s financial statements as consolidated VIEs: 
  Parion Sciences, Inc. 
  License and Collaboration Agreement 
    
  On   June 4, 2015  , the Company entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement (the  Parion Agreement ) with Parion Sciences, Inc. ( Parion ).  Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is collaborating with Parion to develop investigational epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) inhibitors, including VX-371 (formerly P-1037) and VX-551 (formerly P-1055), for the potential treatment of CF and all other pulmonary diseases.  The Company is leading development activities for VX-371 and VX-551 and is responsible for all costs, subject to certain exceptions, related to development and commercialization of the compounds. 
    
  Pursuant to the Parion Agreement, the Company has worldwide development and commercial rights to Parion s lead investigational ENaC inhibitors, VX-371 and VX-551, for the potential treatment of CF and all other pulmonary diseases and has the option to select additional compounds discovered in Parion s research program.  Parion received an   $80.0 million   up-front payment and has the potential to receive up to an additional (i)   $490.0 million   in development and regulatory milestone payments for development of ENaC inhibitors in CF, including   $360.0 million   related to global filing and approval milestones, (ii)   $370.0 million   in development and regulatory milestones for VX-371 and VX-551 in non-CF pulmonary indications and (iii)   $230.0 million   in development and regulatory milestones should the Company elect to develop an additional ENaC inhibitor from Parion s research program.  The Company has agreed to pay Parion tiered royalties that range from the low double digits to mid-teens as a percentage of potential sales of licensed products. 
    
  The Company may terminate the Parion Agreement upon   90   days  notice to Parion prior to any licensed product receiving marketing approval or upon   180   days  notice after a licensed product has received marketing approval.  If the Company experiences a change of control prior to the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial for a licensed product, Parion may terminate the Parion Agreement upon   30   days  notice, subject to the Company s right to receive specified royalties on

any subsequent commercialization of licensed products.  The Parion Agreement also may be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions.  Unless earlier terminated, the Parion Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the Company s royalty obligations, which expire on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the date the last-to-expire patent covering a licensed product expires or (ii)   ten   years after the first commercial sale in the country. 
    
  The Company determined that Parion is a VIE based on, among other factors, the significance to Parion of the ENaC inhibitors licensed to the Company pursuant to the Parion Agreement and on the Company s power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of Parion.  Accordingly, the Company consolidated Parion s financial statements beginning on   June 4, 2015  .  However, the Company s interests in Parion are limited to those accorded to the Company in the Parion Agreement.  In particular, the Company did not acquire any equity interest in Parion, any interest in Parion s cash and cash equivalents or any control over Parion s activities that do not relate to the Parion Agreement. 
  Consideration for the Parion Agreement 
    
  The Company determined that the fair value of the consideration from the Company to Parion was   $255.3 million   as of   June 4, 2015  , which consisted of (i) an   $80.0 million   up-front payment, (ii) the estimated fair value of the contingent research and development milestones potentially payable by the Company to Parion and (iii) the estimated fair value of potential royalty payments payable by the Company to Parion.  The critical assumptions in the valuation model included probability and timing of making payments and the discount rate.  The Company valued the contingent milestone and royalty payments using (a) discount rates ranging from   4.1%   to   5.9%   for the development milestones and (b) a discount rate of   6.6%   for royalties.  The consideration paid and the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments payable by the Company pursuant to the Parion Agreement are set forth in the table below: 

Allocation of Assets and Liabilities 
    
  For the purposes of the consolidated balance sheet at   June 4, 2015  , the Company allocated the total consideration, which is comprised of the up-front payment and the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments, intangible assets, goodwill, deferred tax liability, net and net other assets and liabilities.  The operations of Parion did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and therefore no pro forma information is provided.  
    
  The Company recorded   $255.3 million   of intangible assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheet for Parion s in-process research and development assets.  These in-process research and development assets relate to Parion s pulmonary ENaC platform, including the intellectual property related to VX-371 and VX-551, that are licensed by Parion to the Company.  The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the fair value of Parion s assets (including the fair value of intangible assets) and liabilities was allocated to goodwill.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets and liabilities recorded on the effective date of the Parion Agreement: 

BioAxone Biosciences, Inc. 
  In October 2014, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the  BioAxone Agreement ) with BioAxone Biosciences, Inc. ( BioAxone ), which resulted in the consolidation of  BioAxone as a VIE beginning on October 1, 2014.  The Company determined that BioAxone is a VIE based on, among other factors, the significance to BioAxone of VX-210, which was licensed to the Company pursuant to the BioAxone Agreement, and on the Company s power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of BioAxone.  Accordingly, the Company consolidated BioAxone s financial statements beginning in October 2014.  The Company paid BioAxone initial payments of   $10.0 million   in the fourth quarter of 2014.  
  BioAxone has the potential to receive up to   $90.0 million   in milestones and fees, including development, regulatory and milestone payments and a license continuation fee.  In addition, BioAxone would receive royalties and commercial milestones on future net product sales of VX-210, if any.   The Company recorded an in-process research and development intangible asset of   $29.0 million   for VX-210 and a corresponding deferred tax liability of   $11.3 million   attributable to BioAxone.  The Company holds an option to purchase BioAxone at a predetermined price.  The option expires on the earliest of (a) the day the FDA accepts the Biologics License Application submission for VX-210, (b) the day the Company elects to continue the license instead of exercising the option to purchase BioAxone and (c) March 15, 2018, subject to the Company s option to extend this date by   one   year.  
  Alios BioPharma, Inc. 
  In 2011, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the  Alios Agreement ) with Alios BioPharma, Inc. ( Alios ), which was a privately-held biotechnology company, which resulted in the consolidation of Alios as a VIE through December 31, 2013.  Pursuant to the Alios Agreement, the Company and Alios collaborated on the research, development and commercialization of HCV nucleotide analogues discovered by Alios through April 2014.  In December 2014, the Alios Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms pursuant to a termination notice delivered by the Company in October 2014.  As of September 30, 2014, the Company concluded that it no longer had significant continuing involvement with Alios due to its intent and ability to terminate the Alios Agreement, among other factors; therefore, the operations of Alios are presented as discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements.   
  Aggregate VIE Financial Information 
  An aggregate summary of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest related to the Company s VIEs for the three years ended   December 31, 2015   was as follows:

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

During the years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments related to the BioAxone Agreement increased by   $0.9 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively.  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments related to the Parion Agreement increased by   $3.6 million  .  The changes in the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments were primarily due to the changes in market interest rates and the time value of money.  As of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments related to the BioAxone Agreement was   $28.0 million   and   $27.1 million  , respectively.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments related to the the Parion Agreement was   $179.0 million  . 
    
  The following table summarizes items related to the Company s VIEs included in the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of the dates set forth in the table: 

The Company has recorded the VIEs  cash and cash equivalents as restricted cash and cash equivalents (VIE) because (i) the Company does not have any interest in or control over the VIEs  cash and cash equivalents and (ii) the Company s agreements with each VIE do not provide for the VIEs  cash and cash equivalents to be used for the development of the assets that the Company licensed from the applicable VIE.  Assets recorded as a result of consolidating the Company s VIEs  financial condition into the Company s balance sheets do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against the Company s general assets.  
  Outlicense Arrangements 
  In the ordinary course of the Company s business, the Company has entered into various agreements pursuant to which it has outlicensed rights to certain drug candidates to third-party collaborators.  Although the Company does not consider any of these outlicense arrangements to be material, the most notable of these outlicense arrangements is described below.  Pursuant to these outlicense arrangements, the Company s collaborators become responsible for all costs related to the continued development of such drug candidates.  Depending on the terms of the arrangements, the Company s collaborators may be required to make upfront payments, milestone payments upon the achievement of certain product research and development objectives and/or pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration.  
    
  Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
  In June 2014, the Company entered into an agreement (the  Janssen Influenza Agreement ) with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Janssen Inc. ), which was amended in October 2014 to clarify certain roles and responsibilities of the parties.  
    
  Pursuant to the Janssen Influenza Agreement, Janssen Inc. has an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize certain drug candidates for the treatment of influenza, including VX-787.  The Company received non-refundable payments of   $35.0 million   from Janssen Inc. in 2014, which were recorded as collaborative revenues.  The

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Company has the potential to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on future product sales, if any.   
  Janssen Inc. is responsible for costs related to the development and commercialization of the compounds.  The Company recorded reimbursement for these development activities of   $22.8 million   and   $9.1 million   in   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  The reimbursements are recorded as a reduction to development expense in the Company s consolidated statements of operations primarily due to the fact that Janssen Inc. directs the activities and selects the suppliers associated with these activities.  Janssen Inc. may terminate the Janssen Influenza Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, upon   six   months  notice. 
             C. 
    Earnings Per Share 
     Basic net loss per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding restricted stock and restricted stock units that have been issued but are not yet vested.  Diluted net loss per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus additional weighted-average common equivalent shares outstanding during the period when the effect is dilutive.  
    
  The Company did not include the securities in the following table in the computation of the net loss from continuing operations per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders calculations because the effect would have been anti-dilutive during each period.   

             D. 
    Fair Value Measurements 
     The fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities reflects the Company s estimate of amounts that it would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from sources independent from the Company) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (the Company s assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).  The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: 
                 Level 1: 
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
      Level 2: 
    Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs.  Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
      Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs based on the Company s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

The Company s investment strategy is focused on capital preservation.  The Company invests in instruments that meet the credit quality standards outlined in the Company s investment policy.  This policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or type of instrument.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company s investments were in money market funds, short-term government-sponsored enterprise securities, corporate debt securities and commercial paper. 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , all of the Company s financial assets that were subject to fair value measurements were valued using observable inputs.  The Company s financial assets valued based on Level 1 inputs consisted of a money market funds and government-sponsored enterprise securities.  The Company s financial assets valued based on Level 2 inputs consisted of corporate debt securities and commercial paper, which consisted of investments in highly-rated investment-grade

corporations.  The fair value of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts was based on Level 2 inputs using third party pricing services.  During   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the Company did not record an other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its financial assets.   
  The following table sets forth the Company s financial assets (excluding VIE cash and cash equivalents) subject to fair value measurements:

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

VIEs had cash equivalents of   $75.1 million   as of   December 31, 2015   that consisted of money market funds, which are valued based on Level 1 inputs.  The Company s noncontrolling interest includes the fair value of the contingent payments, which are valued based on Level 3 inputs.  Please refer to   Note B,  Collaborative Arrangements,    for further information. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value and carrying value of the Company s Term Loan was   $295.4 million  .  The fair value of the Company s Term Loan was estimated based on Level 3 inputs computed using the effective interest rate of the Term Loan.

    Hedging 
     The Company maintains a hedging program intended to mitigate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates for a portion of the Company s forecasted product revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies.  The program includes foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under GAAP having contractual durations from   one   to   eighteen   months.   
  The Company formally documents the relationship between foreign currency forward contracts (hedging instruments) and forecasted product revenues (hedged items), as well as the Company s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging activities, which includes matching all foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions.  The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the foreign currency forward contracts are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items on a prospective and retrospective basis.  If the Company determines that a (i) foreign currency forward contract is not highly effective as a cash flow hedge, (ii) foreign currency forward contract has ceased to be a highly effective hedge or (iii) forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, the Company would discontinue hedge accounting treatment prospectively.  The Company measures effectiveness based on the change in fair value of the forward contracts and the fair value of the hypothetical foreign currency forward contracts with terms that match the critical terms of the risk being hedged.  As of   December 31, 2015  , all hedges were determined to be highly effective and the Company had not recorded any ineffectiveness related to the hedging program.

Total property and equipment, gross, as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , included   $106.8 million   and   $85.6 million  , respectively, for property and equipment recorded under capital leases.  Accumulated depreciation, as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , included   $30.4 million   and   $13.1 million  , respectively, for property and equipment recorded under capital leases.   
  As of   December 31, 2015  , included in property and equipment, net were   $15.4 million   and   $4.1 million   in capitalized internally developed software costs and related amortization, respectively.  As of   December 31, 2014  , included in property and equipment, net were   $11.2 million   and   $1.2 million   in capitalized internally developed software costs and related amortization, respectively.

  In 2014, in connection with the relocation of the Company s headquarters in Massachusetts from Cambridge to Boston, the Company wrote off certain leasehold improvements that were fully depreciated and no longer utilized.  There was no effect on the Company s net property and equipment at the time of the write off because the Company had previously adjusted the useful lives of these assets to coincide with its relocation when it concluded that the relocation was probable.

    Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
     Intangible Assets 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , in-process research and development intangible assets of   $284.3 million   were recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. The increase of   $255.3 million   as compared to the   $29.0 million   recorded as of   December 31, 2014   is due to the Company s collaboration with Parion.  
  In June 2015, in connection with entering into the Parion Agreement, the Company recorded an in-process research and development intangible asset of   $255.3 million   based on the Company s estimate of the fair value of Parion s lead investigational ENaC inhibitors, including VX-371 and VX-551, that were licensed by the Company from Parion.  The Company aggregated the fair value of the ENaC inhibitors into a single intangible asset because the phase, nature and risks of development as well as the amount and timing of benefits associated with the assets were similar.  In October 2014, the Company recorded   $29.0 million   of an in-process research and development intangible asset on its consolidated balance sheet based on the Company s estimate of the fair value of VX-210, a drug candidate for patients who have spinal cord injuries that is licensed from BioAxone by the Company.  The Company used discount rates of   7.1%   and   7.5%   in the present-value models to estimate the fair values of the ENaC inhibitors and VX-210 intangible assets, respectively.  The Company also conducted an evaluation of Parion and BioAxone s other programs at the effective date of the Parion Agreement and BioAxone Agreement, respectively, and determined that market participants would not have ascribed value to those programs because of the stage of development of the assets in each program and uncertainties related to the potential development and commercialization of the programs.  
  In 2013, the Company determined that there were indicators that the value of the VX-222 intangible asset acquired from ViroChem in 2010 of   $412.9 million   reflected on its consolidated balance sheet had become impaired. The Company evaluated the fair value of VX-222 from the perspective of a market participant and based on this analysis determined that the fair value of VX-222 was   zero   based on, among other things, additional data regarding VX-222 and compounds being developed by other competitors.  Accordingly, the Company recorded a   $412.9 million   impairment charge in 2013.  In connection with this impairment charge, the Company recorded a credit of   $127.6 million   in its provision for income taxes.  In 2013, the increase to the Company s net loss attributable to Vertex related to this impairment charge, net of the tax credit, was   $285.3 million  , and the net increase to the Company s net loss per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders was   $1.27   per share.  
  Goodwill 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , goodwill of   $50.4 million   was recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet.  The Company allocated   $10.5 million   to goodwill related to the Parion collaboration during the year ended   December 31, 2015  .   None of the goodwill related to the Parion collaboration is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.  As of   December 31, 2014  ,   $39.9 million   was recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet.

Other liabilities, current portion consisted of the following: 

L. 
    Long Term Obligations 
     Fan Pier Leases 
  In 2011, the Company entered into   two   lease agreements, pursuant to which the Company leases approximately   1.1 million   square feet of office and laboratory space in   two   buildings (the  Buildings ) at Fan Pier in Boston, Massachusetts (the  Fan Pier Leases ).  The Company commenced lease payments in December 2013, and will make lease payments pursuant to the Fan Pier Leases through December 2028.  The Company has an option to extend the term of the Fan Pier Leases for an additional   10   years. 
   Because the Company was involved in the construction project, the Company was deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the Buildings during the construction period and recorded project construction costs incurred by the landlord. Upon completion of the Buildings, the Company evaluated the Fan Pier Leases and determined that the Fan Pier Leases did  
      
  F-30

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

not meet the criteria for  sale-leaseback  treatment.  Accordingly, the Company began depreciating the asset and incurring interest expense related to the financing obligation in 2013.  The Company bifurcates its lease payments pursuant to the Fan Pier Leases into (i) a portion that is allocated to the Buildings and (ii) a portion that is allocated to the land on which the Buildings were constructed.  The portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land is treated as an operating lease that commenced in 2011.  The Company recorded interest expense of   $60.2 million   in each of   2015   and   2014   and of   $12.4 million   in   2013  .  The Company recorded depreciation expense of   $13.3 million  ,   $13.4 million   and   $2.6 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  In each of   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the Company recorded rent expense of   $6.5 million  . 
  Property and equipment, net, included   $502.3 million   and   $515.0 million   as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, related to construction costs for the Buildings.  The carrying value of the construction financing lease obligation related to the Buildings, which excludes interest that will be imputed over the course of the Company s lease agreement for the Buildings, was   $473.0 million   and   $473.4 million  , as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.   
  San Diego Lease 
  On December 2, 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for 3215 Merryfield Row, San Diego, California with ARE-SD Region No. 23, LLC.  Pursuant to this agreement, the Company agreed to lease approximately   170,000   square feet of office and laboratory space in a building to be built in San Diego, California.  The lease will commence upon completion of the building, scheduled for the second half of 2017, and will extend for   16 years   from the commencement date. Pursuant to the lease agreement, during the initial 16-year term, the Company will pay an average of approximately   $10.2 million   per year in aggregate rent, exclusive of operating expenses.  The Company has the option to extend the lease term for up to   two   additional   five  -year terms. 
    
  Term Loan 
  On July 9, 2014, the Company entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto, and Macquarie US Trading LLC ( Macquarie ), as administrative agent.  The credit agreement provides for a   $300.0 million   senior secured term loan ( Term Loan ).  The credit agreement also provides that, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, the Company may request that the lenders establish an incremental senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed   $200.0 million  .  
  The Term Loan initially bore interest at a rate of   7.2%   per annum, which was reduced to   6.2%   per annum based on the FDA s approval of ORKAMBI.  The Term Loan will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus   5.0%   per annum during the third year of the term.   
    
  The maturity date of all loans under the facilities is July 9, 2017.  Interest is payable quarterly and on the maturity date. In October 2015, the Company amended the terms of the credit agreement to provide for, among other things, a modification to the repayment schedule of the loan.  As amended, the Company is required to repay principal on the Term Loan in quarterly installments of   $75 million   from October 1, 2016 through the maturity date.  
  The Company may prepay the Term Loan, in whole or in part, at any time; provided that prepayments prior to the July 9, 2016 are subject to a make-whole premium to ensure Macquarie receives approximately the present value of   two   years of interest payments over the life of the loan.  The Company accounted for the amendment as a debt modification, as opposed to an extinguishment of debt, based on an insignificant change to the present value of the future cash flows relating to the credit agreement. 
  The Company s obligations under the Term Loan are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of its domestic subsidiaries.  All obligations under the Term Loan, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the Company s assets and the assets of all guarantors, including the pledge of all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of its subsidiaries.  
   The credit agreement requires that the Company maintain, on a quarterly basis, a minimum level of KALYDECO net revenues.  Further, the credit agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting the Company s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, pay dividends, repurchase capital stock and enter into

transactions with affiliates.  The credit agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults and cross defaults.  If an event of default occurs, the administrative agent would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under outstanding loans.  There have been no events of default as of or during the period ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Based on the Company s evaluation of the Term Loan, the Company determined that the Term Loan contains several embedded derivatives.  These embedded derivatives are clearly and closely related to the host instrument because they relate to the Company s credit risk; therefore, they do not require bifurcation from the host instrument, the Term Loan. 
  The Company incurred   $5.3 million   in fees paid to Macquarie that were recorded as a discount on the Term Loan and that are being recorded as additional interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the loan in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.  As of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the unamortized discount associated with the Term Loan that was included in the senior secured term loan caption on the Company s consolidated balance sheets was   $4.6 million   and   $5.2 million  , respectively. 
  Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes 
  In September 2010, the Company completed an offering of   $400.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   3.35%   convertible senior subordinated notes due 2015 Notes (the  2015 Notes ).  This offering resulted in   $391.6 million   of net proceeds to the Company.  The underwriting discount and other expenses of   $8.4 million   were recorded as debt issuance costs and were included in other assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  The 2015 Notes bore interest at the rate of   3.35%   per annum, and the Company was required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the 2015 Notes on April 1 and October 1 of each year. 
  The 2015 Notes were convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a price equal to approximately   $48.83   per share, or 20.4794 shares of common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of the 2015 Notes, subject to adjustment.  If the closing price of the Company s common stock exceeded   130%   of the conversion price for at least   20   trading days within a period of   30   consecutive trading days, the Company had the right to redeem the 2015 Notes at its option at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the 2015 Notes to be redeemed. 
  In the second quarter of 2013, the Company s common stock exceeded   130%   of the conversion price of the 2015 Notes for at least   20   trading days within a period of   30   consecutive trading days, and the Company notified the holders of the 2015 Notes that it would redeem the 2015 Notes on June 17, 2013.  In response to the Company s call of the 2015 Notes for redemption, in accordance with the provisions of the 2015 Notes, the holders of   $399.8 million   in aggregate principal amount of 2015 Notes elected to convert their 2015 Notes into the Company s common stock at the conversion price of approximately   $48.83   per share.  As a result of these conversions, the Company issued   8,188,448   shares of common stock.  The remaining   $0.2 million   in aggregate principal amount of 2015 Notes was redeemed on June 17, 2013.  
  Pursuant to the terms of the 2015 Notes, the Company made an additional payment of   $16.75   per $1,000 principal amount, payable in shares of the Company s common stock, to the holders of the 2015 Notes that converted or redeemed their 2015 Notes after the Company called the 2015 Notes for redemption.  These payments resulted in the issuance of an additional   87,109   shares of the Company s common stock.  In the second quarter of 2013, the Company recognized an aggregate of   $6.7 million   in interest expense related to the 2015 Notes.  Unamortized debt issuance costs for the 2015 Notes of   $4.2 million   were recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital.  
             M. 
    Common Stock, Preferred Stock and Equity Plans 
     During 2015, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company s Restated Articles of Organization increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from   300,000,000   to   500,000,000  .   Holders of common stock are entitled to   one   vote per share.  Holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by the Company s Board of Directors, and to share ratably in the Company s assets legally available for distribution to the Company s shareholders in the event of liquidation.  Holders of common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights.  The holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights.

The Company is authorized to issue   1,000,000   shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers, designations, preferences and relative participating, option or other rights thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption terms, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series, without any further vote or action by the Company s shareholders.  As of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company had no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.  
  Stock and Option Plans 
  The purpose of each of the Company s stock and option plans is to attract, retain and motivate its employees, consultants and directors.  Awards granted under these plans can be incentive stock options ( ISOs ), nonstatutory stock options ( NSOs ), restricted stock ( RSs ), restricted stock units ( RSUs ) or other equity-based awards, as specified in the individual plans. 
  Shares issued under all of the Company s plans are funded through the issuance of new shares.  The following table contains information about the Company s equity plans:  

All options granted under the Company s 2013 Stock and Option Plan ( 2013 Plan ), 2006 Stock and Option Plan ( 2006 Plan ) and 1996 Stock and Option Plan were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the stock and option plan under which the Company makes new equity awards is the Company s 2013 Plan.  Under the 2013 Plan, no stock options can be awarded with an exercise price less than the fair market value on the date of grant.  The Company s shareholders (i) approved an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance pursuant to the 2013 Plan of   7,800,000   shares, plus the number of shares that remained available for issuance under the Company s 2006 Stock and Option Plan, which rolled-over into the 2013 Stock and Option Plan in 2015, (ii) approved an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance pursuant to the 2013 Plan of   9,500,000   shares in 2014 and (iii) authorized   3,300,000   shares for issuance pursuant to the 2013 Plan in 2013. 
  During the three years ended   December 31, 2015  , grants to current employees and directors primarily had a grant date that was the same as the date the award was approved by the Company s Board of Directors.  During the three years ended   December 31, 2015  , for grants to new employees and directors, the date of grant for awards was the employee s first day of employment or the date the director was elected to the Company s Board of Directors.  All options awarded under the Company s stock and option plans expire not more than   10   years from the grant date. 
  During the three years ended   December 31, 2015  , all shares of outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units have been granted at a price equal to   $0.01  , the par value of the Company s common stock.  Vesting of options, restricted stock and restricted stock units generally is ratable over specified periods and is determined by the Company s Board of Directors.

  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
  The Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the  ESPP ).  The ESPP permits eligible employees to enroll in a   twelve  -month offering period comprising   two     six  -month purchase periods.  Participants may purchase shares of the Company s common stock, through payroll deductions, at a price equal to   85%   of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the applicable   twelve  -month offering period, or the last day of the applicable six-month purchase period, whichever is lower.  Purchase dates under the ESPP occur on or about May 14 and November 14 of each year.  As of   December 31, 2015  , there were   1,163,614   shares of common stock authorized for issuance pursuant to the ESPP. 
  In   2015  , the following shares were issued to employees under the ESPP:

    Stock-based Compensation Expense 
     The Company recognizes share-based payments to employees as compensation expense using the fair value method.  The fair value of stock options and shares purchased pursuant to the ESPP is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the intrinsic value on the date of grant.  Stock-based compensation, measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, is typically recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period.  The expense recognized over the requisite service period includes an estimate of awards that will be forfeited. 
  The effect of stock-based compensation expense during the three years ended   December 31, 2015   was as follows:

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The stock-based compensation expense by type of award during the three years ended   December 31, 2015   was as follows: 

In 2013, the Company also recognized stock-based compensation expense recorded to noncontrolling interest (Alios), which is reflected in the Company s consolidated statements of shareholders equity and noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet and in discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest as of December 31, 2014. 
  The Company capitalizes stock-based compensation expense to inventories, all of which is attributable to employees who support the Company s manufacturing operations for the Company s products. 
  The following table sets forth the Company s unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, as of   December 31, 2015  , by type of award and the weighted-average period over which that expense is expected to be recognized:  

Stock Options 
  The Company issues stock options with service conditions, which are generally the vesting periods of the awards.  The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options at the grant date.  The Black-Scholes option pricing model uses the option exercise price as well as estimates and assumptions related to the expected price volatility of the Company s stock, the rate of return on risk-free investments, the expected period during which the options will be outstanding, and the expected dividend yield for the Company s stock to estimate the fair value of a stock option on the grant date.  The options granted during   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   had a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of   $52.16  ,   $39.95   and   $25.79  , respectively. 
  The fair value of each option granted during   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

    Expected stock price volatility:    Expected stock price volatility is calculated using the trailing one month average of daily implied volatilities prior to grant date.  Implied volatility is based on options to purchase the Company s stock with remaining terms of greater than one year that are regularly traded in the market.   
                
    Risk-free interest rate:    The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is commensurate with the assumed expected option term. 
                
    Expected term of options:    The expected term of options represents the period of time options are expected to be outstanding.  The Company uses historical data to estimate employee exercise and post-vest termination behavior.  The Company believes that all groups of employees exhibit similar exercise and post-vest termination behavior and therefore does not stratify employees into multiple groups in determining the expected term of options. 
                
    Expected annual dividends:    The estimate for annual dividends is   $0.00   because the Company has not historically paid, and does not intend for the foreseeable future to pay, a dividend.   
     Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 
  The Company issues restricted stock and restricted stock units with service conditions, which are generally the vesting periods of the awards.  The Company also issues, to certain members of senior management, on an annual basis restricted stock and restricted stock units that vest upon the earlier of the satisfaction of (i) a performance condition or (ii) a service condition.  In addition, in 2015 and 2014, the Company issued, pursuant to a retention program, restricted stock awards to certain members of senior management that will vest upon the satisfaction of both (i) a performance condition and (ii) a service condition.   
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
  The weighted-average fair value of each purchase right granted during   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   was   $37.84  ,   $29.59   and   $21.08  , respectively.  The following table reflects the weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  : 

The expected stock price volatility for ESPP offerings is based on implied volatility.  The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is commensurate with the assumed expected term.  The expected term represents purchases and purchase periods that take place within the offering period.  The expected annual dividends estimate is   $0.00   because the Company has not historically paid, and does not for the foreseeable future intend to pay, a dividend. 
             O. 
    Other Arrangements 
     Sale of HIV Protease Inhibitor Royalty Stream 
  In 2008, the Company sold to a third party its rights to receive royalty payments from GlaxoSmithKline plc, net of royalty amounts to be earned by and due to a third party, for a one-time cash payment of   $160.0 million  .  These royalty payments relate to net sales of HIV protease inhibitors, which had been developed pursuant to a collaboration agreement between the Company and GlaxoSmithKline plc.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $26.0 million   in deferred revenues related to the one-time cash payment, which it is recognizing over the life of the collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc based on the units-of-revenue method.  In addition, the Company continues to recognize royalty

revenues equal to the amount of the third-party subroyalty and an offsetting royalty expense for the third-party subroyalty payment. 
  Other income (expense), net 
  In April 2014, the Company received a one-time cash payment of   $36.7 million   from its landlord pursuant to the Fan Pier Leases.  This payment related to bonds issued pursuant to an Infrastructure Development Assistance Agreement between The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Company s landlord.  The bonds were issued in connection with the landlord s contribution to infrastructure improvements and also were dependent upon employment levels at the Company through the bond issuance date.  The Company accounted for the cash payment as a government grant as it was provided in part related to the Company s employment level in Massachusetts.  Such grants are recognized in income in the period in which the conditions of the grant are met and there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, provided it is not subject to refund.  In the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded   $36.7 million   as a credit to other income (expense), net in its   consolidated statements of operations because the Company s employment obligations related to these funds were satisfied as of the date of issuance of the bonds and the payment received is not subject to refund.

    Income Taxes 
     The components of loss from continuing operations before provision for (benefit from) income taxes during the three years ended   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following: 

The components of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes from continuing operations during the three years ended   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following: 

The difference between the Company s  expected  tax provision (benefit), as computed by applying the U.S. federal corporate tax rate of   35%   to loss from continuing operations before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and actual tax is reconciled as follows: 
      
  F-38 

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The foreign rate differential in the tax rate reconciliation table reflects the effect of operations in jurisdictions with tax rates that are different from the United States.  As set forth in the components of loss before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, the Company had losses in foreign jurisdictions in each year presented.  Due to lower foreign tax rates, particularly in the United Kingdom, the Company s tax benefit in foreign loss jurisdictions is less than the  expected  tax benefit that would have resulted from losses in these jurisdictions at corporate tax rates in the United States.  The difference between the tax benefit at foreign corporate tax rates and the  expected  benefit based on corporate tax rates in the United States is reflected in the tax reconciliation table under the caption  foreign rate differential.   
  The unbenefitted operating losses in the tax rate reconciliation table primarily reflect a change in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to the United States, United Kingdom and Switzerland.  In 2015 and 2014, the valuation allowance increased primarily due to an increase in the net operating loss in the United States with no benefit due to the uncertainty in the Company s ability to use them in future periods.  In the United Kingdom and Switzerland losses have been incurred that cannot be benefitted due to uncertainty in the Company s ability to use them in future periods resulting in an unfavorable effect on the tax provision. 
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The components of the deferred taxes were as follows: 

F-39 

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The Company presents its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities gross on its consolidated balance sheets.  As of   December 31, 2015  ,   $110.4 million   of the deferred tax liabilities are attributable to the Company s collaborations with BioAxone and Parion.  As of   December 31, 2014  ,   $11.5 million   of the deferred tax liabilities are attributable to the Company s collaboration with BioAxone.  
  For federal income tax purposes, as of   December 31, 2015  , the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately   $4.2 billion   and tax credits of   $217.5 million  , which may be used to offset future federal income and tax liability, respectively.  Approximately   $1.1 billion   of the federal net operating loss carryforward will result in an increase to additional paid-in capital if and when these carryforwards are used to reduce income taxes payable.   
  For state income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately   $1.0 billion   and tax credits of   $97.3 million  , which may be used to offset future state income and tax liability, respectively.  Approximately   $195.1 million   of the state net operating loss carryforward will result in an increase to additional paid-in capital if and when these carryforwards are used to reduce state income taxes payable.   
  These federal and state operating loss carryforwards and tax credits expire at various dates through 2035.  After consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance for the majority of the   2015   deferred tax asset because it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  In future periods, if management determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized, (i) the valuation allowance would be decreased, (ii) a portion or all of the deferred tax asset would be reflected on the Company s consolidated balance sheet and (iii) the Company would record non-cash benefits in its consolidated statements of operations related to the reflection of the deferred tax asset on its consolidated balance sheets. 
  The valuation allowance increased by   $306.4 million   from   December 31, 2014   to   December 31, 2015   primarily due to an increase in net operating losses and credits. 
  Unrecognized tax benefits during the two years ended   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following: 

The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of   $0.4 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively, as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  .  At   December 31, 2015  ,   $0.4 million   represented the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in a reduction of the Company s effective tax rate.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense.  As of   December 31, 2015  ,   no   interest and penalties have been accrued.  In 2016, it is reasonably possible that the Company will reduce the balance of its unrecognized tax benefits by approximately   $0.4 million   due to the application of statute of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities, all of which would reduce the Company s effective tax rate. 
  The Company files United States federal income tax returns and income tax returns in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.  The Company is no longer subject to any tax assessment from an income tax examination in the United States before 2011 or any other major taxing jurisdiction for years before 2010, except where the Company has net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards that originate before 2010.  The Company currently is under examination by Revenue Quebec for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the Internal Revenue Service, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Texas for the various periods between December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2013.  No adjustments have been reported.  The Company is not under examination by any other jurisdictions for any tax year.  The Company concluded audits with the Canada Revenue Agency and Revenue Quebec during 2014, and Massachusetts and New York during 2015, with no material adjustments. 
  At   December 31, 2015  , foreign earnings, which were not significant, have been retained indefinitely by foreign subsidiary companies for reinvestment; therefore, no provision has been made for income taxes that would be payable upon  
      
  F-40

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

the distribution of such earnings, and it would not be practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability.  Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.   
             Q. 
    Restructuring Expenses 
     Facility Lease Obligations 
  The Company has adopted several plans to restructure its facility operations for which it has incurred restructuring expenses in the three years ended   December 31, 2015  .  The Company s initial estimate of its liabilities for net ongoing costs associated with these facility obligations are recorded at fair value on the cease use date.  In estimating the expenses and liabilities related to these facilities, the Company utilizes a probability-weighted discounted cash-flows of the Company s ongoing lease obligations.  In estimating the expense and liability under its lease obligations, the Company estimated (i) the costs to be incurred to satisfy rental and build-out commitments under the lease (including operating costs), (ii) the lead-time necessary to sublease the space, (iii) the projected sublease rental rates and (iv) the anticipated durations of subleases.  The Company uses a credit-adjusted risk-free rate to discount the estimated cash flows. 
  The Company reviews its estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis, intends to continue such reviews until the termination of these facility lease obligations, and will make whatever modifications the Company believes necessary, based on the Company s best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances.  The Company s estimates have changed in the past, and may change in the future, resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of these liabilities.  Changes to the Company s estimate of these liabilities are recorded as additional restructuring expenses (credits).  In addition, because the Company s estimate of these liabilities includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time-value of money, the Company records imputed interest costs related to these liabilities each quarter.  These costs are included in restructuring expenses on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 
  2003 Kendall Restructuring 
  In 2003, the Company adopted a plan to restructure its operations (the  2003 Kendall Restructuring ) to coincide with its increasing internal emphasis on advancing drug candidates through clinical development to commercialization.  The restructuring was designed to re-balance the Company s relative investments in research and development to better support the Company s long-term strategy.  At that time, the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction, write-offs of certain assets and a decision not to occupy approximately   290,000   square feet of specialized laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts under lease to Vertex (the  Kendall Square Lease ).  The Kendall Square Lease commenced in January 2003 and has a   15  -year term.  In 2005, the Company revised its assessment of its real estate requirements and decided to use approximately   120,000   square feet of the facility subject to the Kendall Square Lease (the  Kendall Square Facility ) for its operations, beginning in 2006.  The rentable square footage of the Kendall Square Facility related to the 2003 Kendall Restructuring currently is subleased to third parties. 
  The restructuring expense incurred from the second quarter of 2003 through the end of the first quarter of 2005 (i.e., immediately prior to the Company s decision to use a portion of the Kendall Square Facility for its operations) relates to the estimated incremental net ongoing lease obligations associated with the entire Kendall Square Facility, together with imputed interest costs relating to the restructuring liability.  The restructuring expense incurred in the period beginning in the second quarter of 2005 relates only to the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that the Company was not occupying and did not intend to occupy for its operations.  The Company uses a discount rate of   10%   related to this restructuring activity.  
  The remaining lease obligations, which are associated with the   120,000   square foot portion of the Kendall Square Facility that the Company occupied and used for its operations, were recorded as rental expense in the period incurred until the Company incurred a cease use charge related to this portion of the Kendall Square Facility in the third quarter of 2014 in connection with transitioning its Massachusetts operations to Fan Pier in Boston, Massachusetts (the  Fan Pier Move Restructuring ).   
  The activity related to restructuring and other liability for 2003 was as follows: 
      
  F-41 

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

In 2003, the lease restructuring and other operating lease expense included   $78.7 million   of lease restructuring expense and   $6.0 million   of lease operating expense incurred prior to the decision not to occupy the Kendall Square Facility.  The restructuring accrual as of December 31, 2003 related only to the lease restructuring expense. 
  The activities related to 2003 restructuring liability for 2004 through   2015   were as follows: 

Fan Pier Move Restructuring 
  In connection with the relocation of its Massachusetts operations to Fan Pier in Boston, Massachusetts, which commenced in 2013, the Company is incurring restructuring charges related to its remaining lease obligations at its facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The majority of these restructuring charges were recorded in the third quarter of 2014 upon decommissioning three facilities in Cambridge.  The Company discounted the estimated cash flows related to the facilities at a discount rate of   9%  .  The Company will continue to incur charges through April 2018 related to the difference between the Company s estimated future cash flows related to its lease obligations, which include an estimate for sublease income to be received if applicable, and its actual cash flows.  The Fan Pier Move Restructuring included lease obligations related to the   120,000   square feet of the Kendall Square Facility that the Company continued to use for its operations following its 2013 Kendall Restructuring.  The remaining rentable square footage of the Kendall Square Facility related to the Fan Pier Move Restructuring was subleased to a third party in February 2015.   
  The activities related to the Fan Pier relocation restructuring liability for the three years ended   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

Other Restructuring Activities 
  The Company has engaged in several other restructuring activities that are unrelated to its 2003 Kendall Restructuring and the Fan Pier Move Restructuring.  The most significant activity commenced in October 2013 when the Company adopted a restructuring plan that included (i) a workforce reduction primarily related to the commercial support of INCIVEK  
      
  F-42 

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

following the continued and rapid decline in the number of patients being treated with INCIVEK as new medicines for the treatment of HCV infection neared approval and (ii) the write-off of certain assets.  This action resulted from the Company s decision to focus its investment on future opportunities in CF and other research and development programs. 
  The activities related to the Company s other restructuring liabilities for the three years ended   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

R. 
    Employee Benefits 
     The Company has a 401(k) retirement plan (the  Vertex 401(k) Plan ) in which substantially all of its permanent U.S. employees are eligible to participate.  Participants may contribute up to   60%   of their annual compensation to the Vertex 401(k) Plan, subject to statutory limitations.  The Company may declare discretionary matching contributions to the Vertex 401(k) Plan.  Through mid-2013, the Company paid matching contributions in Vertex common stock in the form of fully-vested interests in a Vertex common stock fund.  Beginning in mid-2013, the Company began paying matching contributions in the form of cash.  For the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the Company contributed approximately   $12.8 million  ,   $12.0 million   and   $12.6 million   to the plan, respectively.  As of   December 31, 2015  ,   755,000   shares of common stock remained available for grant under the Vertex 401(k) Plan.  In   2013  , the Company declared matching contributions paid in fully-vested interests in the Vertex common stock fund to the Vertex 401(k) Plan as follows:

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Lease Obligations 
  The Company moved into its corporate headquarters in January 2014.  Please refer to   Note L,  Long Term Obligations,    for additional information regarding this commitment.  In December 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for 3215 Merryfield Row, San Diego, California.  Please refer to   Note L,  Long Term Obligations,    for additional information regarding this commitment. 
  The Kendall Square Lease began in January 2003 and will expire in April 2018.  The Company occupied and used for its operations approximately   120,000   square feet of the Kendall Square Facility until 2014 when it moved its operations to Fan Pier.  The Company has sublease arrangements in place for the remaining rentable square footage of the Kendall Square Facility, with terms that expire concurrently with the Kendall Square Lease.  Please refer to   Note Q,  Restructuring Expenses,    for further information.

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

As of   December 31, 2015  , future minimum commitments under the Fan Pier Leases, facility leases with terms of more than one year and contractual sublease income under the Company s subleases for the Kendall Square Facility as adjusted for a sublease executed in February 2015 were as follows: 

During   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , rental expense was   $18.1 million  ,   $38.9 million   and   $57.7 million  , respectively.  The majority of the Company s lease payments related to the Fan Pier Leases are recorded as interest expense because the Company is deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the Buildings.  Please refer to   Note L,  Long Term Obligations,    for further information. 
  The Company has outstanding leases, which are accounted for as capital leases, for equipment, leasehold improvements and software licenses with terms through 2019.  The capital leases bear interest at rates ranging from less than   1%   to   9%   per year.  The following table sets forth the Company s future minimum payments due under capital leases as of   December 31, 2015  : 

In addition, the Company has committed to make potential future milestone and royalty payments pursuant to certain collaboration agreements.  Payments generally become due and payable upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones.  Please refer to   Note B,  Collaborative Arrangements,    for further information. 
  Financing Arrangements 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had irrevocable stand-by letters of credit outstanding that were issued in connection with property leases and other similar agreements totaling   $21.9 million   that are cash collateralized.  The cash used to support these letters of credit is included in restricted cash, as of   December 31, 2015  , on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. 
  Litigation 
  On May 28, 2014, a purported shareholder class action   Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Plan   Trust v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, et al.   was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming the Company and certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors as defendants.  The lawsuit alleged that  
      
  F-44 

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

the Company made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact in the Company s disclosures during the period from May 7, 2012 through May 29, 2012, all in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The purported class consists of all persons (excluding defendants) who purchased the Company s common stock between May 7, 2012 and May 29, 2012.  The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys  fees as well as disgorgement of the proceeds from certain individual defendants  sales of the Company s stock.  On October 8, 2014, the Court approved Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Fund as lead plaintiff, and Scott and Scott LLP as lead counsel for the plaintiff and the putative class.  The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on December 8, 2014 and the plaintiffs filed their opposition to the Company s motion to dismiss on January 22, 2015.  On February 23, 2015, the Company filed a reply to the plaintiffs  opposition to its motion to dismiss.  The court heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss on March 6, 2015 and took the motion under advisement.  On September 30, 2015, the court granted the Company s motion to dismiss.  On October 15, 2015, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal.  The Company believes the claims to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend the litigation.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company has not recorded any reserves for this purported class action. 
  Guaranties and Indemnifications 
  As permitted under Massachusetts law, the Company s Articles of Organization and By-laws provide that the Company will indemnify certain of its officers and directors for certain claims asserted against them in connection with their service as an officer or director.  The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited.  However, the Company has purchased directors  and officers  liability insurance policies that could reduce its monetary exposure and enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.  No indemnification claims currently are outstanding, and the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal. 
  The Company customarily agrees in the ordinary course of its business to indemnification provisions in agreements with clinical trial investigators and sites in its drug development programs, sponsored research agreements with academic and not-for-profit institutions, various comparable agreements involving parties performing services for the Company, and its real estate leases.  The Company also customarily agrees to certain indemnification provisions in its drug discovery, development and commercialization collaboration agreements.  With respect to the Company s clinical trials and sponsored research agreements, these indemnification provisions typically apply to any claim asserted against the investigator or the investigator s institution relating to personal injury or property damage, violations of law or certain breaches of the Company s contractual obligations arising out of the research or clinical testing of the Company s compounds or drug candidates.  With respect to lease agreements, the indemnification provisions typically apply to claims asserted against the landlord relating to personal injury or property damage caused by the Company, to violations of law by the Company or to certain breaches of the Company s contractual obligations.  The indemnification provisions appearing in the Company s collaboration agreements are similar to those for the other agreements discussed above, but in addition provide some limited indemnification for its collaborator in the event of third-party claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights.  In each of the cases above, the indemnification obligation generally survives the termination of the agreement for some extended period, although the Company believes the obligation typically has the most relevance during the contract term and for a short period of time thereafter.  The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these provisions is generally unlimited.  The Company has purchased insurance policies covering personal injury, property damage and general liability that reduce its exposure for indemnification and would enable it in many cases to recover all or a portion of any future amounts paid.  The Company has never paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions.  Accordingly, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal. 
  Other Contingencies 
  The Company has certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities.  The Company accrues a reserve for contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.  There were no material contingent liabilities accrued as of   December 31, 2015   or   2014  .

  Generally, only items that are deducted from the Selling Party s gross invoiced sales price of Product(s), as included in the Selling Party s published financial statements and that are in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis, will be deducted from such gross invoiced sales price for purposes of the calculation of Net Sales. However, compulsory payments required by federal or state governments based upon sales volume or market share of Products (but for clarity excluding taxes on the Selling Party s net income), to the extent borne by the Selling Party, will be deducted from  Net Sales  regardless of its classification in the Selling Party s published financial statements;   provided   that any such deduction will be limited to that share of such compulsory payment proportional to the share of the total sales volume or market share of the Selling Party used to compute the compulsory payment represented by applicable Net Sales of Products.

The weighted average invoice prices referenced above will be calculated with reference to the prevailing prices during the applicable Calendar Quarter in those top selling countries that equate to [***] of Net Sales of the applicable Product in the Territory, with the prices weighted in the calculation to reflect the actual relative sales value of the Product in each of the countries to which the calculation relates. If it is not possible to determine the fraction A/(A+B) based on the criteria specified in the preceding sentence (  e.g.  , if a Product component is not sold separately), the Parties shall determine Net Sales for the Product in such Combination Product in good faith by mutual agreement [***].

The [***]  ;     provided  , that if, notwithstanding [***], CRISPR believes that a Target is a CRISPR Reserved Target under paragraph 3 of Schedule A, CRISPR may pursue [***] solely with respect to [***].  If a proposed Target is not [***] due to the provisions of this Section 2.3.2(c), such Target will not count against the Substitution Cap (if applicable) and the Vertex Target on the Vertex Target List that was to be replaced by such Target shall remain on the Vertex Target List (if applicable).  If, during the Research Term, any Target excluded from the Vertex Target List pursuant to this Section 2.3.2(c) ceases to be a CRISPR Reserved Target, CRISPR will promptly notify Vertex that such Target is no longer a CRISPR Reserved Target, and, thereafter, Vertex may at its option (exercisable at any time within [***] of such notice) add such Target to the Vertex Target List, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.3.2.  Vertex may remove Targets from the Vertex Target List upon written notice to CRISPR and thereafter such removed Target will no longer be a Vertex Target (unless such Target is later added again as a Vertex Target in accordance with this Section 2.3.2).   
              2.3.3. 
    Collaboration Target Selection  .  Vertex may elect to designate a Vertex Target as a Collaboration Target at any time during the Research Term upon written notice to CRISPR.  Within [***] after the designation of a Collaboration Target, the Collaboration Program Working Group will be formed and will provide the JRC an initial draft Research Plan for such Collaboration Target.  Subject to Section 3.1.3, the JRC will review such plan and agree upon a final Research Plan for such Collaboration Target. Collaboration Targets continue to be included as Vertex Targets for purposes of the Target Cap.

              9.1.31. 
    any claims of any nature arising out of the Research, Development, Manufacture, Commercialization or use of any Licensed Agent or Product by, on behalf of, or under the authority of, Vertex (other than by any CRISPR Indemnified Party), other than (a)  claims by Third Parties relating to misappropriation of trade secrets or other intellectual property rights arising out of the exercise of rights under the Licensed Know-How, or (b) claims for which CRISPR is required to indemnify Vertex pursuant to Section 10.2; or

       53 

Exhibit 10.6 
  Confidential Materials omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Triple asterisks denote omissions. 

9.2.16. 
    the material breach by CRISPR (or any CRISPR Entity(ies)) of any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement, except to the extent caused by the negligence or intentional acts of Vertex or any Vertex Indemnified Party; or 
              9.2.17. 
    any claims of any nature arising out of the Research activities performed by CRISPR (or any CRISPR Entity(ies)) with respect to any Licensed Agent or Product prior to the Effective Date or during the Research Term, other than claims for which Vertex is required to indemnify CRISPR pursuant to Section 10.1. 
              9.3. 
    Procedure  .  Each Party will notify the other Party in writing if it becomes aware of a claim for which indemnification may be sought hereunder.  In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) will be instituted involving any Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this ARTICLE 10, such Party (the    Indemnified Party   ) will give prompt written notice of the indemnity claim to the other Party (the    Indemnifying Party   ) and provide a copy to the Indemnifying Party of any complaint, summons or other written or verbal notice that the Indemnified Party receives in connection with any such claim.  An Indemnified Party s failure to deliver written notice will relieve the Indemnifying Party of liability to the Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE 10 only to the extent such delay is prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party s ability to defend such claim. Provided that the Indemnifying Party is not contesting the indemnity obligation, the Indemnified Party will permit the Indemnifying Party to control any litigation relating to such claim and the disposition of such claim by negotiated settlement or otherwise and any failure to contest prior to assuming control will be deemed to be an admission of the obligation to indemnify.  The Indemnifying Party will act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to such claim and will not settle or otherwise resolve such claim without the Indemnified Party s prior written consent which will not be withheld, delayed or conditioned unreasonably other than settlements only involving the payment of monetary awards for which the Indemnifying Party will be fully-responsible.

              9.4. 
    Insurance  . Each Party will maintain, at its cost, reasonable insurance against liability and other risks associated with its activities contemplated by this Agreement and will furnish to the other Party evidence of such insurance upon request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vertex may self-insure to the extent that it self-insures for its other activities. 
              9.5. 
    Limitation of Consequential Damages  .  Except for (a) claims of a Third Party that are subject to indemnification under this ARTICLE 10, (b) claims arising out of a Party s willful misconduct, or (c) a Party s breach of Section 2.13 or ARTICLE 12, neither Party nor any of its Affiliates will be liable to the other Party or its Affiliates for any incidental, consequential, special, punitive or other indirect damages or lost or imputed profits or royalties, lost data or cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, whether liability is asserted in contract, tort (including negligence and strict product liability), indemnity or contribution, and irrespective of whether that Party or any representative of that Party has been advised of, or otherwise might have anticipated the possibility of, any such loss or damage.

              10.1.19. 
    in its entirety upon the expiration of all payment obligations under this Agreement with respect to all Products in all countries pursuant to Section 11.1.1; and 
              10.1.20. 
    in its entirety upon expiration of all Options if Vertex has not exercised any Option as provided in Section 4.1.1. 
               10.2.13. 
    Vertex s Termination for Convenience  .  Vertex will be entitled to terminate this Agreement as a whole, or terminate this Agreement in part with respect to a particular Collaboration Program, for convenience by providing CRISPR 90 days  written notice of such termination;   provided, however  , that if any termination under this Section 11.2.1 applies to a Product for which Vertex has received Marketing Approval, Vertex will provide CRISPR no less than 270 days  notice of such termination. 
              10.2.14. 
    Termination Due to Failure to Obtain HSR Clearance  . If the Parties make an HSR Filing with respect to a Collaboration Target under Section 4.1.2 and the HSR Clearance Date has not occurred on or prior to [***] after the effective date of the latest HSR Filing made by the Parties with respect to a Collaboration Target, this Agreement will terminate solely with respect to the applicable Collaboration Program at the election of either Party immediately upon notice to the other Party, if (a) the FTC or the DOJ has instituted (or threatened to institute) any action, suit or proceeding including seeking, threatening to seek or obtaining a preliminary injunction under the HSR Act against Vertex and CRISPR to enjoin or otherwise prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement related to such proposed Collaboration Program, or (b) the Parties have not resolved any and all objections of the FTC and DOJ as contemplated by Section 4.1.2(b).

            (c) 
    Vertex s Right to Terminate  .  If CRISPR (or any CRISPR Entity(ies)) is in material breach of this Agreement, then Vertex may deliver notice of such material breach to CRISPR.  If the breach is curable, CRISPR will have [***] from the receipt of such notice to cure such breach.  If either CRISPR fails to cure such breach within such [***] period or the breach is not subject to cure (a    CRISPR Breach Event   ), Vertex may either (i) terminate this Agreement (A) if such breach relates solely relates to a particular Collaboration Program, with respect to the Collaboration Program affected by such breach (a    CRISPR Program Breach   ) or (B) if such breach relates to multiple Collaboration Programs or this Agreement as a whole (a    CRISPR Agreement Breach   ), in its entirety, by providing written notice to CRISPR or (ii) elect to exercise the alternate remedy provisions set forth in Section 11.3 (in lieu of termination).  
       
           (d) 
    CRISPR s Right to Terminate.     
       
           (i) 
    If Vertex is in material breach of this Agreement, then CRISPR may deliver notice of such material breach to Vertex.  If the breach is curable, Vertex will have [***] following receipt of such notice to cure such breach (except to the extent such breach involves the failure to make a payment when due, which breach must be cured within [***] following receipt of such notice).  If Vertex fails to cure such breach within the [***] or [***] period, as applicable, or the breach is not subject to cure, CRISPR in its sole discretion may terminate this Agreement (i) if such breach relates solely relates to a particular Collaboration Program, with respect to the Collaboration Program affected by such breach or (ii) if such breach relates to multiple Collaboration Programs or this Agreement as a whole, in its entirety, by providing written notice to Vertex.  
              (ii) 
    If Vertex (A) commences or actively and voluntarily participates in any action or proceeding (including any patent opposition or re-examination proceeding), or otherwise asserts any claim, challenging or denying the validity or enforceability of any claim of any Patent  that is licensed to Vertex under this Agreement or (B) actively and voluntarily assists any other Person in bringing or prosecuting any action or proceeding (including any patent opposition or re-examination proceeding) challenging or denying the validity or enforceability of any claim of any Patent that is licensed to Vertex under this Agreement (each of (A) and (B), a    Patent Challenge   ), then, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, CRISPR shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to give notice to Vertex that CRISPR may terminate the license(s) granted under such Patent to Vertex [***] following such notice, and, unless Vertex withdraws or causes to be withdrawn all such challenge(s) (or in the case of   ex-parte   proceedings, multi-party proceedings, or other Patent Challenges that Vertex does not have the power to unilaterally withdraw or cause to be withdrawn), Vertex

ceases assisting any other party to such Patent Challenge and, to the extent Vertex is a party to such Patent Challenge, it withdraws from such Patent Challenge within such [***] period, CRISPR shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice thereof to Vertex.  The foregoing right to terminate shall not apply with respect to any Patent Challenge where the Patent Challenge is made in defense of an assertion of the relevant Patent that is first brought by CRISPR against Vertex.  For the avoidance of doubt, any participation by Vertex or its employees in any claim, challenge or proceeding in response to a subpoena or as required under a pre-existing agreement between Vertex s employee(s) or consultant(s) and their prior employer(s) shall not constitute active and voluntary participation or assistance and shall not give rise to CRISPR s right to terminate any license hereunder.  
           10.2.16. 
    Disputes Regarding Material Breach  .  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Breaching Party in Section 11.2.3 disputes in good faith the existence, materiality, or failure to cure of any such breach that is not a payment breach, and provides notice to the Non-Breaching Party of such dispute within the relevant cure period, the Non-Breaching Party will not have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.2.3, or the right to exercise the alternative remedy provisions of 11.3, as applicable, unless and until the relevant dispute has been resolved.  It is understood and acknowledged that during the pendency of such dispute, all the terms and conditions of this Agreement will remain in effect and the Parties will continue to perform all of their respective obligations hereunder. 
              10.2.17. 
    Termination for Insolvency  .  If CRISPR (or any CRISPR Entity(ies)) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, appoints or suffers appointment of a receiver or trustee over all or substantially all of its property, files a petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency act or has any such petition filed against it that is not discharged within [***] of the filing thereof (each, an    Insolvency Event   ), then Vertex may terminate this Agreement in its entirety effective immediately upon written notice to CRISPR.  If Vertex terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.2.5:  
              (a) 
    All rights and licenses now or hereafter granted by CRISPR to Vertex under or pursuant to this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Exclusive Licenses are, for all purposes of Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, licenses of rights to  intellectual property  as defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Upon the occurrence of any Insolvency Event with respect to CRISPR (or any CRISPR Entity(ies)), CRISPR agrees that Vertex, as licensee of such rights under this Agreement, will retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and elections under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  CRISPR will, during the term of this Agreement, create and maintain current copies or, if not amenable to copying, detailed descriptions or other appropriate embodiments, to the extent feasible, of all intellectual property licensed under this Agreement.  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that  embodiments  of intellectual property within the meaning of Section 365(n) include laboratory notebooks, cell lines, product samples and inventory, research studies and data, all Regulatory Approvals (and

all applications for Regulatory Approval) and rights of reference therein, the Licensed Technology and all information related to the Licensed Technology.  If (x) a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is commenced by or against CRISPR (or any CRISPR Entity(ies)), (y) this Agreement is rejected as provided in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and (z) Vertex elects to retain its rights hereunder as provided in Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, CRISPR (in any capacity, including debtor-in-possession) and its successors and assigns (including a trustee) will: 
    
           (i) 
    provide to Vertex all such intellectual property (including all embodiments thereof) held by CRISPR and such successors and assigns, or otherwise available to them, immediately upon Vertex s written request.  Whenever CRISPR or any of its successors or assigns provides to Vertex any of the intellectual property licensed hereunder (or any embodiment thereof) pursuant to this Section 11.2.5(a)(i), Vertex will have the right to perform CRISPR s obligations hereunder with respect to such intellectual property, but neither such provision nor such performance by Vertex will release CRISPR from liability resulting from rejection of the license or the failure to perform such obligations; and 
              (ii) 
    not interfere with Vertex s rights under this Agreement, or any agreement supplemental hereto, to such intellectual property (including such embodiments), including any right to obtain such intellectual property (or such embodiments) from another entity, to the extent provided in Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
              (b) 
    All rights, powers and remedies of Vertex provided herein are in addition to and not in substitution for any and all other rights, powers and remedies now or hereafter existing at law or in equity (including the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) in the event of the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with respect to CRISPR.  The Parties agree that they intend the following rights to extend to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, and to be enforceable under U.S. Bankruptcy Code Section 365(n): 
       
           (i)

During the Agreement Term, each Party will submit to the other Party (the    Non-Disclosing Party   ) for review and approval any proposed academic, scientific and medical publication or public presentation related to any Licensed Agent or Product or any activities conducted pursuant to any Research Plan. In each such instance, such review and approval will be conducted for the purposes of preserving the value of the Licensed Technology and the Vertex Technology, the rights granted to Vertex hereunder and determining whether any portion of the proposed publication or presentation containing the Non-Disclosing Party s Confidential Information should be modified or deleted.  Written copies of such proposed publication or presentation required to be submitted hereunder will be submitted to the Non-Disclosing Party no later than [***] before submission for publication or presentation (or five Business Days in advance in the case of an abstract).  The Non-Disclosing Party will provide its comments with respect to such publications and presentations within [***] of its receipt of such written copy (or [***] in the case of an abstract).  The review period may be extended for an additional [***] if the Non-Disclosing Party reasonably requests such extension including for the preparation and filing of patent applications.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Non-Disclosing Party may require that the other Party redact the Non-Disclosing Party s Confidential Information from any such proposed publication or presentation.  CRISPR and Vertex will each comply with standard academic practice regarding authorship of scientific publications and recognition of contribution of other parties in any publication.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vertex s obligation to submit any publication to CRISPR for review and approval under this Section 12.5.3 will not apply to any publication made with respect to a Collaboration Program following Vertex s exercise of the applicable Option that does not contain CRISPR s Confidential Information or disclose any non-public information included in the Licensed Technology;   provided  , that where reasonably possible, Vertex will provide CRISPR with an advance copy of such publication if such publication is [***]. 
               11.6.1. 
    If Vertex determines in good faith that CRISPR (or any CRISPR Entity(ies)) is an entity that is subject to financial consolidation with Vertex for the purposes of its quarterly and annual financial statements (or otherwise requires such information in order to comply with GAAP), CRISPR will make available to Vertex:

Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics Establish Collaboration to Use CRISPR- Cas9 Gene Editing Technology to Discover and Develop New Treatments for Genetic Diseases 

-Gene editing technology to be used to discover treatments to address the mutations and genes known to cause and contribute to cystic fibrosis- 

-Vertex and CRISPR to utilize gene editing approach to discover treatments for genetic diseases, including sickle cell disease- 

-Companies establish four-year research collaboration; CRISPR to receive $105 million up- front payment, of which $30 million is an equity investment, with potential for additional milestones and royalty payments- 

BOSTON  AND  CAMBRIDGE,  MASS     October  XX,  2015  -       Vertex  Pharmaceuticals     Incorporated     (Nasdaq: VRTX) and   CRISPR Therapeutics     today announced that the two companies have entered into a strategic research collaboration focused on the use of CRISPR s gene editing technology, known as CRISPR-Cas9, to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease.  The collaboration will evaluate the use of CRISPR-Cas9 across multiple diseases where targets have been validated through human genetics.  Vertex and CRISPR will focus their initial gene editing research on discovering treatments to address the mutations and genes known to cause and contribute to cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease.  Vertex and CRISPR will also evaluate a specified number of other genetic targets as part of the collaboration.  Vertex will have exclusive rights to license up to six new CRISPR-Cas9-based treatments that emerge from the collaboration.  As part of the collaboration, Vertex made an up-front commitment of $105 million to CRISPR, including $75 million in cash and a $30 million equity investment.  CRISPR is also eligible to receive future development, regulatory and sales milestones and royalty payments on future sales. 
    
   CRISPR-Cas9 is an important scientific and technological breakthrough that holds significant promise for the future discovery of potentially transformative treatments for many genetic diseases,   said  David  Altshuler,  M.D.,  Ph.D.,  Vertex s  Executive  Vice  President,  Global Research and Chief Scientific Officer.    As a company founded on innovative science, we re 
    
    SCHEDULE M 

excited to begin this collaboration with CRISPR, as it puts us at the forefront of what we believe may  be  a  fundamental  change  in  the  future  treatment  of  disease  --  using  gene  editing technologies to address the underlying genetic causes of many diseases.  
    
   Vertex has a track record of developing innovative medicines for cystic fibrosis and other serious diseases, making them a great partner to accelerate the therapeutic promise of gene editing,  said Rodger Novak, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of CRISPR Therapeutics.   For CRISPR, this collaboration validates the potential for gene editing in human therapeutics and provides important financial support for continued investment in our platform and proprietary pipeline of programs.  
    
  About the Collaboration 
    
  Under the terms of the collaboration, Vertex and CRISPR will jointly use the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to discover and develop potential new treatments that correct defects in specific gene targets known to cause or contribute to particular diseases.  The initial focus of the collaboration will be on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 to potentially correct the mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene known to result in the defective protein that causes CF and to edit other genes that contribute to the disease.  Additionally, the companies will seek to discover and develop gene-based treatments for hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease.  Additional discovery efforts focused on a specified number of other genetic targets will also be conducted under the collaboration.  Discovery activities will be conducted primarily by CRISPR, and the related expenses will be fully funded by Vertex.  Vertex has the option to an exclusive license for up to six gene-based treatments that emerge from the four-year research collaboration.  Vertex will fund 100 percent of the development expenses of licensed treatments. For each of the up to six treatments in-licensed for development, Vertex will pay future development, regulatory and sales milestones of up to $420 million as well as royalty payments on future sales. 
    
  Vertex and CRISPR will collaborate on the research, development and commercialization of treatments for hemoglobinopathies that emerge from the collaboration.   Specifically for hemoglobinopathies,  including  treatments  for  sickle  cell  disease,  Vertex  and  CRISPR  will equally share all research and development costs and sales, with CRISPR Therapeutics leading commercialization efforts in the U.S.  For all other diseases, Vertex will lead all development and global commercialization activities. 
    
  Vertex will pay CRISPR $75 million in cash as part of its up-front commitment.  Vertex will also provide a $30 million investment in CRISPR, which is a private company.  The investment will 

provide Vertex with an ownership stake in CRISPR.   The collaboration also provides Vertex with an observer seat on the CRISPR Board of Directors, which will be filled by Dr. Altshuler. 
    
  About Gene Editing with CRISPR-Cas9 
    
   CRISPR  refers to Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats that occur in the genome  of  certain  bacteria,  from  which  the  system  was  discovered.    Cas9  is  a  CRISPR- associated endonuclease (an enzyme) known to act as the  molecular scissors  that cut and edit, or correct, disease-associated DNA in a cell.  A guide RNA directs the Cas9 molecular scissors to the exact site of the disease-associated mutation.  Once the molecular scissors make a cut in the DNA, additional cellular mechanisms and exogenously added DNA will use the cell s own machinery and other elements to specifically  repair  the DNA.  This technology may offer the ability to directly modify or correct the underlying disease-associated changes in the human genome for the potential treatment of a large number of both rare and common diseases. 
    
  Emmanuelle Charpentier, Ph.D., one of      CRISPR Therapeutics  scientific founders  , co-invented the CRISPR-Cas9 technology and is the recipient of multiple prestigious awards in recognition of the potential contribution that the CRISPR-Cas9 technology may have on global health.  The other scientific co-founders of CRISPR are Craig Mello, Ph.D., Chad Cowan, Ph.D., Matthew Porteus, M.D., Ph.D., and Daniel Anderson, Ph.D.

If the Landlord Delivery Date does not occur (i) within 60 days after the Target Commencement Date (as such date may be extended to the extent of Tenant Delays and Force Majeure delays (provided that in no event may Force Majeure delays exceed 9 months) on a day-for day basis) (as extended, the    Adjusted Target Commencement Date   ) the Abatement Period (as defined in   Section 3   below) shall be extended by one additional day for each day after the Adjusted Target Commencement Date that Landlord fails to Deliver the Premises to Tenant, and (ii) within 120 days after the Adjusted Target Commencement Date, the Abatement Period shall thereafter be extended by two days for each day after the date that is 120 days after the Adjusted Target Commencement Date that Landlord fails to Deliver the Premises.  As used herein, the terms    Landlord s Work  ,     Cold Shell  ,     Tenant s Work  ,     Tenant Delay    and    Tenant Improvement Work Readiness Condition      shall have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Work Letter. 
  The    Commencement Date    shall be the earlier of (i) the Landlord Delivery Date, and (ii) the date Landlord could have Delivered the Premises but for Tenant Delays.  The    Rent Commencement Date    shall be the date that is 10 months after the Commencement Date.  If substantial completion of the Tenant s Work is delayed due to Landlord Delays (as defined in the Work Letter) or Force Majeure (provided that in no event may Force Majeure delays exceed 4.5 months) beyond the scheduled Rent Commencement Date as calculated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Rent Commencement Date shall be extended to the extent of such Landlord Delays and/or Force Majeure (provided that in no event may Force Majeure delays exceed 4.5 months) on a day-for-day basis. Upon request of either party, Landlord and Tenant shall execute and deliver a written acknowledgment of the Commencement Date, the Rent Commencement Date and the expiration date of the Term when such are established in the form of the  Acknowledgement of Commencement Date  attached to this Lease as   Exhibit D  ;   provided  ,   however  , the failure of either party to execute and deliver such acknowledgment shall not affect either party s rights hereunder.  The    Term    of this Lease shall be the Base Term, as defined above on the first page of this Lease and any Extension Terms which Tenant may elect pursuant to   Section 40   hereof. 
  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that (i) Landlord s obligation to develop the Building as contemplated in this Lease is subject to Landlord entering into a lease termination agreement with The Scripps Research Institute, an existing tenant in a building located at the Project as of the date of this Lease, for an early termination of its lease at the Project on terms and conditions acceptable to Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion (the    Lease Termination Agreement   ), and (ii)  the effectiveness of this Lease shall be subject to Landlord entering into the Lease Termination Agreement on or before March 25, 2016 (which March 25, 2016 date shall not be extended due to Force Majeure) (the    Condition Precedent   ).  If the Condition Precedent is not satisfied by the date set forth above, this Lease shall automatically terminate in its entirety and none of the provisions of this Lease shall have any force or effect.  If this Lease terminates pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, neither Landlord nor Tenant shall have any further rights, duties or obligations under this Lease. 
  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that (i) Landlord does not currently have the required governmental entitlements necessary for the development of the Building or the Project as contemplated in this Lease (collectively, the    Approvals   ), (ii) Landlord shall have no obligation to commence the construction of the Building prior to obtaining such Approvals (and the expiration of any challenge periods), (iii) Landlord s obligation to develop the Building as contemplated in this Lease is subject to Landlord s ability to obtain, on terms and conditions acceptable to Landlord in its reasonable discretion, all of the Approvals, and (iv) Landlord shall have the sole right to determine all matters related to the Approvals.  Landlord shall use good faith reasonable efforts to obtain the Approvals, provided such Approvals are on terms acceptable to Landlord, in its reasonable discretion.  If, notwithstanding Landlord s good faith reasonable efforts, Landlord is unable to obtain a building permit for Landlord s Work from the City of San Diego (the    Building Permit   ) on or

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord obtains the Building Permit prior to the exercise by Landlord or Tenant of the foregoing termination right, then such termination right shall expire and be of no further force or effect. Tenant agrees that, upon reasonable advance written request from Landlord, to make a senior level executive of Tenant (Vice President or higher) available to attend meetings with Landlord and the City of San Diego, to support Landlord in its efforts to obtain on an expedited basis the necessary governmental approvals (including, without limitation, the Approvals) to construct the Building as contemplated in this Lease.

If Tenant does not (1) timely deliver an Intention Notice, and (2) elect to terminate this Lease by delivery of written notice pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence within 10 business days of the Target Demolition Completion Date, such right to terminate this Lease shall be waived and this Lease shall remain in full force and effect. If the Landlord Delivery Date does not occur by May 1, 2017 (as such date may be extended to the extent of Tenant Delays and Force Majeure delays (provided that in no event may Force Majeure delays exceed 6 months) (as extended, the    Outside Landlord Delivery Date   ), this Lease may be terminated by Tenant by written notice to Landlord, and if so terminated by Tenant, neither Landlord nor Tenant shall have any further rights, duties or obligations under this Lease, except with respect to provisions which expressly survive termination of this Lease.  If Tenant does not elect to terminate this Lease pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence within 10 business days following the Outside Landlord Delivery Date, such right to terminate this Lease shall be waived and this Lease, and any applicable extension of the Abatement Period, shall remain in full force and effect.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease and for the avoidance of any doubt, the termination rights set forth in this   Section 2   shall terminate on the Commencement Date; provided, however that such termination of Tenant s termination rights shall in no event affect or be deemed a forfeiture of any extension of the Abatement Period to which Tenant may be entitled pursuant to this   Section 2  . 
  Except as set forth in the Work Letter:  (i) Tenant shall accept the Premises in their condition as of the Commencement Date, subject to all applicable Legal Requirements (as defined in   Section 7   hereof); and (ii) Landlord shall otherwise have no obligation for any defects in the Premises.

Any access to the Premises by Tenant before the Commencement Date shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Lease, excluding the obligation to pay Base Rent and Operating Expenses. 
  Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Lease, Tenant agrees and acknowledges that neither Landlord nor any agent of Landlord has made any representation or warranty with respect to the suitability of the Premises or the Project for the conduct of Tenant s business, and Tenant waives any implied warranty that the Premises or the Project are suitable for the Permitted Use.

   permanently in the operation of Class A office and laboratory buildings in the Torrey Pines area of San Diego; provided, however, that in no event shall any specific piece of equipment that is part of the original construction of the Building be leased as part of such original construction of the Building and passed through as part of Operating Expenses (but, for the avoidance of any doubt any replacement of such equipment may be leased by Landlord and the cost thereof, to the extent such leasing costs do not exceed the capital costs of comparable purchased equipment amortized as set forth herein, passed through as part of Operating Expenses unless such cost is expressly required to be excluded as provided for in this clause (aa));

  (ee)        to the extent that Tenant does not lease space in the Spectrum 3 Building, costs incurred with respect to Common Areas located within and serving only tenants of the Spectrum 3 Building;

  (hh)        the costs of improvements, maintenance, repairs or replacements to be made to the Spectrum 3 Building or any portion thereof; and  
  (ii)        any expenses otherwise includable within Operating Expenses to the extent actually reimbursed by persons other than tenants of the Project under leases for space in the Project. 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, commencing on the Rent Commencement Date, all costs and expenses of any kind incurred by Landlord or Tenant (including, without limitation, for operations, maintenance, repairs and/or replacements) with  respect to the Exclusive Use Areas shall be fully allocable to the Building and Tenant shall be responsible for 100% of all such costs and expenses (except to the extent such costs are excluded from Operating Expenses pursuant to this   Section 5  ). Tenant shall not be responsible for maintenance costs and expenses incurred by Landlord or any other tenant of the Project with respect to areas of the Project which may be designated by Landlord as exclusive use areas serving only the Spectrum 3 Building or areas of the Project that are materially inaccessible to Tenant, except to the extent caused by Tenant or any Tenant Party. 
  Within 90 days after the end of each calendar year (or such longer period as may be reasonably required not to exceed 180 days after the end of the calendar year), Landlord shall furnish to Tenant a statement (an    Annual Statement   ) showing in reasonable detail:  (a) the total and Tenant s Share of actual Operating Expenses for the previous calendar year, and (b) the total of Tenant s payments in respect of  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 9 

   Operating Expenses for such year.  If Tenant s Share of actual Operating Expenses for such year exceeds Tenant s payments of Operating Expenses for such year, the excess shall be due and payable by Tenant as Rent within 30 days after delivery of such Annual Statement to Tenant.  If Tenant s payments of Operating Expenses for such year exceed Tenant s Share of actual Operating Expenses for such year Landlord shall pay the excess to Tenant within 30 days after delivery of such Annual Statement, except that after the expiration, or earlier termination of the Term or if Tenant is delinquent in its obligation to pay Rent, Landlord shall pay the excess to Tenant after deducting all other amounts due Landlord.  Landlord s and Tenant s obligations to pay any overpayments or deficiencies due pursuant to this paragraph shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  Following November 30   th    of each calendar year, Tenant shall not be responsible for the payment of items of Operating Expenses not reflected in the Annual Statement delivered by Landlord for the prior calendar year, except for Taxes for which Tenant is responsible under this Lease and/or any costs for which Landlord is billed after November 30   th    of the calendar year in which the Annual Statement is delivered. 
  The Annual Statement shall be final and binding upon Tenant unless Tenant, within 180 days after Tenant s receipt thereof (or, with respect to any item for which Tenant is responsible under such Annual Statement for which Tenant is billed following Landlord s delivery of such Annual Statement to Tenant, within 180 days after Tenant s receipt of such bill), shall contest any item therein by giving written notice to Landlord, specifying each item contested and the reason therefor.  If, during such applicable 180 day period, Tenant reasonably and in good faith questions or contests the accuracy of Landlord s statement of Tenant s Share of Operating Expenses, Landlord will provide Tenant (or a representative designated by Tenant by written notice to Landlord) with access to Landlord s books and records relating to the operation of the Project and such information reasonably necessary to evaluate the Operating Expenses (the    Expense Information   ).  If after Tenant s review of such Expense Information, Landlord and Tenant cannot agree upon the amount of Tenant s Share of Operating Expenses, then Tenant shall have the right to have an independent regionally or nationally recognized real estate company that provides operating expense auditing services selected by Tenant and approved by Landlord (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), working pursuant to a fee arrangement other than a contingent fee (at Tenant s sole cost and expense, except as otherwise expressly provided in this paragraph), audit and/or review the Expense Information for the year in question (the    Independent Review   ).  The results of any such Independent Review shall be binding on Landlord and Tenant.  If the Independent Review shows that the payments actually made by Tenant with respect to Operating Expenses for the calendar year in question exceeded Tenant s Share of Operating Expenses for such calendar year, Landlord shall at Landlord s option either (i) credit the excess amount to the next succeeding installments of estimated Operating Expenses or (ii) pay the excess to Tenant within 30 days after delivery of such statement, except that after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or if Tenant is delinquent in its obligation to pay Rent, Landlord shall pay the excess to Tenant after deducting all other amounts due Landlord.  If the Independent Review shows that Tenant s payments with respect to Operating Expenses for such calendar year were less than Tenant s Share of Operating Expenses for the calendar year, Tenant shall pay the deficiency to Landlord within 30 days after delivery of such statement.  If the Independent Review shows that Tenant has overpaid with respect to Operating Expenses by more than 4% then Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for all costs incurred by Tenant for the Independent Review.  Operating Expenses for the calendar years in which Tenant s obligation to share therein begins and ends shall be prorated.   
  Landlord and Tenant agree that the rentable square footage of the Premises and the Building set forth on page 1 of this Lease shall be the rentable square footage of the Premises and the Building during the Term of this Lease and shall not be subject to re-measurement unless expressly agreed to in writing by the parties (e.g., in connection with a Change Order (as defined in the Work Letter)).   
  Upon the substantial completion of the Spectrum 3 Building, Landlord shall determine the rentable square footage of the Spectrum 3 Building in accordance with either (i) ANSI/BOMA Z65.3-2009 for the Gross Areas of Building, if the Spectrum 3 Building will be a single tenant building, or (ii) the BOMA 2010 Standard Methods of Measurement for multi-tenant buildings, if the Spectrum 3 Building will be leased to multiple tenants.  Once the rentable square footage of the Spectrum 3 Building has been determined pursuant  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 10 

   to the immediately preceding sentence, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing of the rentable square footage of the Spectrum 3 Building.  If the Rentable Area of Project (based on the rentable square footage of the Spectrum 3 Building plus the Rentable Area of the Building) deviates from the amount reflected in the definition of    Rentable Area of Project    on page 1 of this Lease, then this Lease shall be amended so as to (i) reflect the Rentable Area of Project (based on the rentable square footage of the Spectrum 3 Building plus the Rentable Area of the Building) and (ii) appropriately adjust the amount set forth in the definition of    Building s Share of Operating Expenses of Project    which was calculated based on the Rentable Area of Project set forth on page 1 of this Lease. 
     Tenant s Share    shall be the percentage set forth on the first page of this Lease as Tenant s Share as reasonably adjusted by Landlord for changes in the physical size of the Premises or the Project occurring thereafter.  For the avoidance of any doubt, Tenant shall pay as part of Operating Expenses the Building s Share of Operating Expenses of Project for those Operating Expenses which are not specific to the Building or the Spectrum 3 Building.  Base Rent, Tenant s Share of Operating Expenses and all other amounts payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder are collectively referred to herein as    Rent  .  
  6.        Intentionally Omitted  .   
  7.        Use  .  The Premises shall be used solely for the Permitted Use set forth in the basic lease provisions on page 1 of this Lease, and in compliance with all laws, orders, judgments, ordinances, regulations, codes, directives, permits, licenses, covenants and restrictions now or hereafter applicable to the Premises, and to the use and occupancy thereof, including, without limitation, the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.   12101, et seq. (together with the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto,    ADA   ) (collectively,    Legal Requirements    and each, a    Legal Requirement   ).  Tenant shall, upon 5 days  written notice from Landlord, discontinue any use of the Premises which is declared by any Governmental Authority (as defined in   Section 9  ) having jurisdiction to be a violation of a Legal Requirement.  Tenant will not use or permit the Premises to be used for any purpose or in any manner that would void Tenant s or Landlord s insurance or cause the disallowance of any sprinkler credits.  Tenant shall reimburse Landlord promptly upon demand for any additional premium charged for any such insurance policy by reason of Tenant s failure to comply with the provisions of this Section or otherwise caused by Tenant s use and/or occupancy of the Premises (other than for general office and non-hazardous laboratory purposes).  Tenant will use the Premises in compliance with this Lease and will not commit or permit waste, overload the floor or structure of the Premises, subject the Premises to use that would damage the Premises (other than ordinary wear and tear) or unreasonably obstruct or unreasonably interfere with the rights of Landlord or other tenants or occupants of the Project, including conducting or giving notice of any auction, liquidation, or going out of business sale on the Premises, or use or allow the Premises to be used for any unlawful purpose.  Tenant shall cause any equipment or machinery to be installed in the Premises so as to reasonably prevent sounds or vibrations from the Premises from extending into Common Areas located outside the Building, or other improved space in the Project.  Tenant shall not place any machinery or equipment which would overload the floor in or upon the Premises. 
  Landlord shall be responsible, at Landlord s cost and not as part of Operating Expenses, for the compliance of the Common Areas of the Project (located outside the Building) and Landlord s Work with Legal Requirements as of Shell Substantial Completion (as defined in the Work Letter).  If, following the Shell Substantial Completion, the Common Areas of the Project and/or Landlord s Work are determined not to be in compliance with Legal Requirements as of the Shell Substantial Completion, Landlord shall, within a reasonable period following such determination, perform, at Landlord s sole cost and expense and not as part of Operating Expenses, the alterations or improvements to the Common Areas of the Project or Landlord s Work, as applicable, required to cause the Common Areas of the Project and Landlord s Work to be in compliance with Legal Requirements as of Shell Substantial Completion.  Following the Commencement Date, Landlord shall, as an Operating Expense (to the extent such Legal Requirement is generally applicable to similar buildings in the area in which the Project is located) and at Tenant s expense (to the extent such Legal Requirement is triggered by reason of Tenant s, as compared to other tenants of the Project, specific use of the Premises or Tenant s Alterations) make any alterations or modifications to the Common Areas or  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 11 

   the exterior of the Building that are required by Legal Requirements.  Except as provided in the 2 immediately preceding sentences, Tenant, at its sole expense, shall make any alterations or modifications to the interior or the exterior of the Premises or the Project that are required by Legal Requirements (including, without limitation, compliance of the Premises with the ADA) related to Tenant s use or occupancy of the Premises.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, Tenant shall be responsible for any and all demands, claims, liabilities, losses, costs, expenses, actions, causes of action, damages or judgments, and all reasonable expenses incurred in investigating or resisting the same (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees, charges and disbursements and costs of suit) (collectively,    Claims   ) arising out of or in connection with Legal Requirements related to Tenant s particular use or occupancy of the Premises or Tenant s Alterations.  For purposes of Section 1938 of the California Civil Code, as of the date of this Lease, the Project has not been inspected by a certified access specialist. 
  8.        Holding Over  .  If, with Landlord s express written consent, Tenant retains possession of the Premises after the termination of the Term, (i) unless otherwise agreed in such written consent, such possession shall be subject to immediate termination by Landlord at any time, (ii) all of the other terms and provisions of this Lease (including, without limitation, the adjustment of Base Rent pursuant to   Section 4   hereof) shall remain in full force and effect (excluding any expansion or renewal option or other similar right or option) during such holdover period, (iii) Tenant shall continue to pay Base Rent in the amount payable upon the date of the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or such other amount as Landlord may indicate, in Landlord s sole and absolute discretion, in such written consent, and (iv) all other payments shall continue under the terms of this Lease.  If Tenant remains in possession of the Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term without the express written consent of Landlord, (A) Tenant shall become a tenant at sufferance upon the terms of this Lease except that the monthly Base Rent shall be equal to 150% of Base Rent in effect during the last 30 days of the Term, and (B) Tenant shall be responsible for all damages suffered by Landlord resulting from or occasioned by Tenant s holding over, including consequential damages.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant notifies Landlord in writing no less than 90 days prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the Term of Tenant s intention to hold over, then (w) Tenant shall become a tenant at sufferance upon the terms of this Lease except that the monthly Base Rent shall (1) for the first 30 days of the holdover period, be equal to 125% of Base Rent in effect during the last 30 days of the Term, and (2) thereafter, commencing on the 31   st    day of such holdover period, be equal to 150% of Base Rent in effect during the last 30 days of the Term, (x)  for the first 30 days of such holdover period, Tenant shall not be responsible for any damages suffered by Landlord resulting from or occasioned by Tenant s holding over,  (y) for the period commencing on the 31   st    day through the 90   th    day of such holdover period, Tenant shall only be responsible for any direct damages suffered by Landlord resulting from or occasioned by Tenant s holding over, and (z) following the 90   th    day of such holdover period, Tenant shall be responsible for all damages suffered by Landlord resulting from or occasioned by Tenant s holding over, including consequential damages. No holding over by Tenant, whether with or without consent of Landlord, shall operate to extend this Lease except as otherwise expressly provided, and this   Section 8   shall not be construed as consent for Tenant to retain possession of the Premises.  Acceptance by Landlord of Rent after the expiration of the Term or earlier termination of this Lease shall not result in a renewal or reinstatement of this Lease. 
  9.        Taxes  .  Landlord shall pay, as part of Operating Expenses, all taxes, levies, fees, assessments and governmental charges of any kind, existing as of the Commencement Date or thereafter enacted (collectively referred to as    Taxes   ), imposed by any federal, state, regional, municipal, local or other governmental authority or agency, including, without limitation, quasi-public agencies (collectively,    Governmental Authority   ) during the Term, including, without limitation, all Taxes:  (i) imposed on or measured by or based, in whole or in part, on rent payable to (or gross receipts received by) Landlord under this Lease and/or from the rental by Landlord of the Project or any portion thereof, or (ii) based on the square footage, assessed value or other measure or evaluation of any kind of the Premises or the Project, or (iii) assessed or imposed by or on the operation or maintenance of any portion of the Premises or the Project, including parking, or (iv) assessed or imposed by, or at the direction of, or resulting from Legal Requirements, or interpretations thereof, promulgated by any Governmental Authority, or (v) imposed as a license or other fee, charge, tax, or assessment on Landlord s business or occupation of leasing space in the Project.  Landlord  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 12 

   may, at Landlord s sole discretion or as otherwise reasonably agreed upon by Landlord and Tenant, contest by appropriate legal proceedings the amount, validity, or application of any Taxes or liens securing Taxes.  Any written request received by Landlord from Tenant requesting that Landlord contest Taxes shall be considered by Landlord in good faith and Landlord s approval of such request shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  If Landlord agrees to contest Taxes pursuant to a request from Tenant, the reasonable costs and expenses in connection with such contest of Taxes shall be borne by Tenant.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Landlord shall only charge Tenant for assessments as if those assessments were paid by Landlord over the longest possible term which Landlord is permitted to pay for the applicable assessments without additional charge other than interest, if any, provided under the terms of the underlying assessments.  If Landlord secures an abatement or refund of Taxes for the Project for a period during the Term, Tenant shall receive Tenant s Share of such abatement or refund (i.e., the net amount after paying all reasonable costs and expenses of security the abatement or refund, including reasonably attorneys  fees) as a credit to be applied by Landlord against Operating Expenses next coming due (or, if no further Operating Expenses are due from Tenant under this Lease and Tenant is not in Default under this Lease, by a cash payment to Tenant). Taxes shall not include any net income taxes, or any capital, stock, succession, transfer, franchise, gift, estate or inheritance taxes imposed on Landlord except to the extent such taxes are in substitution for any Taxes payable hereunder, nor shall Taxes include any late payments, penalties or fines (except to the extent such late penalties, penalties or fines are incurred as a result of Tenant s timely failure to pay Tenant s Share of Taxes as required under this Lease).  Taxes shall also not include any items to the extent otherwise included in Operating Expenses, costs incurred by Landlord with respect to the original development and construction of the Building, Taxes accruing with respect to the Building (and the development of the Building) prior to the Rent Commencement Date, costs incurred with respect to the original development and construction of Spectrum 3 Building, reserves for future taxes, or any development fee (whether payable on a one-time or annual basis) imposed on Landlord specifically as a condition for the issuance of the development permit for the Building (e.g., fees for transit, housing, schools, open space, child care, arts programs, traffic mitigations measures, environmental impact reports and traffic studies; provided, however, that Tenant shall be required to comply with any traffic demand management plans applicable to the Project and the costs thereof shall be included as part of Operating Expenses).  If any such Tax is levied or assessed directly against Tenant, then Tenant shall be responsible for and shall pay the same at such times and in such manner as the taxing authority shall require.  Tenant shall pay, prior to delinquency, any and all Taxes levied or assessed against any personal property or trade fixtures placed by Tenant in the Premises, whether levied or assessed against Landlord or Tenant.  If any Taxes on Tenant s personal property or trade fixtures are levied against Landlord or Landlord s property, or if the assessed valuation of the Project is increased by a value attributable to improvements in or alterations to the Premises, whether owned by Landlord or Tenant and whether or not affixed to the real property so as to become a part thereof, higher than the base valuation on which Landlord from time-to-time allocates Taxes to all tenants in the Project, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to pay such Taxes.  Landlord s determination of any excess assessed valuation shall be binding and conclusive, absent manifest error.  The amount of any such payment by Landlord shall constitute Additional Rent due from Tenant to Landlord within 30 days following demand. 
  10.        Parking  .  Subject to all matters of record, Force Majeure, a Taking (as defined in   Section 19   below) and the exercise by Landlord of its rights hereunder, Tenant shall have the right, at no additional cost to Tenant during the Base Term, to use 400 parking spaces at the Project, subject to Landlord s reasonable rules and regulations.  Tenant shall have the exclusive right to use all of the parking spaces located in the subterranean parking garage under the Building, which shall be applied against the total number of parking spaces made available for Tenant s use pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.  Tenant shall have the right to install, subject to compliance with Legal Requirements, a roll down door at the main entrance of the subterranean parking garage to control access to the subterranean parking garage via the use of Building access cards.  The balance of the parking spaces available for Tenant s use shall be located in the portions of surface parking lot located on and serving the Project designated for non-reserved parking in common with other tenants of the Project.  Tenant will use reasonable efforts to cause the parking spaces located in the subterranean parking garage to be fully occupied before using parking spaces in the surface parking lot located on and serving the Project.  Landlord shall in no event grant rights to other tenants  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 13 

   of the Project to use more parking spaces in the surface parking lot than, together with the spaces allocated to Tenant pursuant to this   Section 10  , are available for use by tenants of the Project in the surface parking lot.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Landlord has the right, during periods of lower demand for parking by Tenant (e.g., after regular business hours) and following written notice to Tenant, to use the surface parking lots serving the Project on a temporary and occasional basis for invitees of The Alexandria. The terms of   Exhibit G   attached hereto shall apply with respect to any installation by Tenant of electric vehicle car charging stations at the Project.  The plan attached as   Exhibit A   reflects the subterranean parking at the Building currently contemplated by Landlord.  Landlord shall not reduce the number of parking spaces in the subterranean parking garage shown on such plan unless required to do so in connection with the Approvals and only after obtaining Tenant s written consent thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Tenant shall not reduce the number of parking spaces in the subterranean parking garage as shown on the plan without Landlord s written consent thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 
  11.        Utilities, Services  .  To the extent that Tenant may do so, Tenant shall contract directly with utility providers for all water, electricity, gas (if applicable), sewer and other utilities, and refuse and trash collection (   Utilities   ) required by Tenant for the Premises following the Rent Commencement Date and continuing during the Term.  Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant, at no cost to Landlord, in making such arrangement with the Utility providers.  If billed directly to Tenant, Tenant shall pay directly to such Utility providers prior to delinquency for all such Utilities furnished to Tenant or the Project during the Term and shall pay for all maintenance charges for Utilities, and any storm sewer charges or other similar charges for Utilities imposed by any Governmental Authority or Utility provider, and any taxes, penalties, surcharges or similar charges thereon. To the extent that any Utilities, maintenance charges for Utilities, any storm sewer charges or other similar charges for Utilities imposed by any Governmental Authority or Utility provider, or any taxes, penalties, surcharges or similar charges are paid for by Landlord, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for such costs as Operating Expenses.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease, no interruption or failure of Utilities, from any cause whatsoever other than Landlord s gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall result in eviction or constructive eviction of Tenant, termination of this Lease or the abatement of Rent.  Tenant shall be responsible for obtaining and paying for its own janitorial services for the Premises. 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if (i) a stoppage of an Essential Service (as defined below) to the Premises shall occur and such stoppage is due solely to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord and not due in any part to any act or omission on the part of Tenant or any Tenant Party or any matter beyond Landlord s reasonable control (any such stoppage of an Essential Service being hereinafter referred to as a    Service Interruption   ), and (ii) such Service Interruption continues for more than 5 consecutive business days after Landlord shall have received written notice thereof from Tenant, and (iii) as a result of such Service Interruption, the conduct of Tenant s normal operations in the Premises are materially and adversely affected, then there shall be an abatement of one day s Base Rent and Operating Expenses for each day during which such Service Interruption continues after such 5 business day period; provided, however, that if any part of the Premises is reasonably useable for Tenant s normal business operations or if Tenant conducts all or any part of its operations in any portion of the Premises notwithstanding such Service Interruption, then the amount of each daily abatement of Base Rent and Operating Expenses shall only be proportionate to the nature and extent of the interruption of Tenant s normal operations or ability to use the Premises.  Except for the self-help rights provided for in   Section 31   below, the rights granted to Tenant under this paragraph shall be Tenant s sole and exclusive remedy resulting from a Service Interruption, and Landlord shall not otherwise be liable for any loss or damage suffered or sustained by Tenant resulting from any failure or cessation of services.  For purposes hereof, the term    Essential Services    shall mean the following services:  gas, water, sewer and electricity, but in each case only to the extent that Landlord has an obligation to provide same to Tenant under this Lease.   
  12.        Alterations and Tenant s Property  .  The Tenant s Work shall be governed by the Work Letter and not this   Section 12  .  Any alterations, additions, or improvements made to the Premises by or on behalf of Tenant, including additional locks or bolts of any kind or nature upon any doors or windows in the Premises, but excluding the installation, removal or realignment of furniture systems (other than removal of  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 14 

   furniture systems owned or paid for by Landlord) not involving any modifications to the structure or connections (other than by ordinary plugs or jacks) to Building Systems (as defined in   Section 13  ) (   Alterations   ) shall be subject to Landlord s prior written consent, which may be given or withheld in Landlord s sole discretion if any such Alteration materially, adversely affects the structure or Building Systems and shall not be otherwise unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may construct non-structural Alterations in the Premises without advance notice to Landlord if the cost of such work does not exceed $250,000 per project (   No Notice Alterations   ).  Upon written request from Landlord not more than once each calendar year, Tenant shall provide  as built  plans for any No Notice Alterations constructed by Tenant in the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall be required to request Landlord s prior written approval with respect to any Alteration that would constitute a No Notice Alteration if such No Notice Alteration would materially diminish the value of any existing leasehold improvements (e.g., converting any laboratory space to office space).  If Landlord approves any Alterations, Landlord may impose such conditions on Tenant in connection with the commencement, performance and completion of such Alterations as Landlord may deem appropriate in Landlord s reasonable discretion.  Any request for approval shall be in writing, delivered not less than 15 days in advance of any proposed construction, and accompanied by plans, specifications, bid proposals, work contracts and such other information concerning the nature and cost of the alterations as may be reasonably requested by Landlord, including the identities and mailing addresses of all persons performing work or supplying materials.  Landlord s right to review plans and specifications and to monitor construction shall be solely for its own benefit, and Landlord shall have no duty to ensure that such plans and specifications or construction comply with applicable Legal Requirements.  Tenant shall cause, at its sole cost and expense, all Alterations to comply with insurance requirements and with Legal Requirements and shall implement at its sole cost and expense any alteration or modification required by Legal Requirements as a result of any Alterations.  Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, on demand an amount equal to the out-of-pocket cost incurred by Landlord in connection with any Alteration to cover Landlord s overhead and expenses for plan review, coordination, scheduling and supervision.  Before Tenant begins any Alteration, Landlord may post on and about the Premises notices of non-responsibility pursuant to applicable law.  Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for, and indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from, any expense incurred by Landlord by reason of faulty work or inadequate cleanup done by Tenant or its contractors.   
  Tenant shall cause the completion of all Alterations work free and clear of liens, and shall provide (and cause each contractor or subcontractor to provide) certificates of insurance for workers  compensation and other coverage in amounts and from an insurance company reasonably satisfactory to Landlord protecting Landlord against liability for personal injury or property damage during construction.  Upon completion of any Alterations, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord:  (i) sworn statements setting forth the names of all contractors and subcontractors who did the work and final lien waivers from all such contractors and subcontractors; and (ii)  as built  plans for any such Alteration. 
  Except for Removable Installations (as hereinafter defined), all Installations (as hereinafter defined) shall be and shall remain the property of Landlord during the Term and following the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, shall not be removed by Tenant at any time during the Term, and shall remain upon and be surrendered with the Premises as a part thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant requests in writing at the time Tenant requests approval of any Installation that Landlord determine whether or not Landlord will require removal of an Installation at the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Landlord shall, within 10 business days after such request, notify Tenant of its determination.  If Landlord by such determination requires that Tenant remove such Installation upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant shall do so in accordance with the immediately succeeding sentence.  Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant shall remove (i) all wires, cables or similar equipment which Tenant has installed in the Premises or in the risers or plenums of the Building other than those installed as part of the Tenant s Work, (ii) any Installations for which Landlord has given Tenant timely notice of removal in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and (iii) all of Tenant s Property (as hereinafter defined), and Tenant shall restore and repair any damage caused by or occasioned as a result of such removal, including, without limitation, capping off all such connections behind the walls of the Premises and repairing any holes.  During any restoration period beyond the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 15 

   shall pay Rent to Landlord as provided herein as if said space were otherwise occupied by Tenant.  If Landlord is requested by Tenant or any lender, lessor or other person or entity claiming an interest in any of Tenant s Property to waive any lien Landlord may have against any of Tenant s Property, and Landlord consents to such waiver, then Landlord shall be entitled to be paid as administrative rent a fee of $1,000 per occurrence for its time and effort in preparing and negotiating such a waiver of lien.   
  For purposes of this Lease, (x)    Removable Installations    means any items listed on   Exhibit F   attached hereto and any items agreed by Landlord in writing to be included on   Exhibit F   in the future, (y)    Tenant s Property    means Removable Installations and, other than Installations, any trade fixtures, personal property or equipment of Tenant that may be removed provided that after such removal and repair of any damage caused by such removal there is no remaining material damage to the Premises and such removal and repair does not adversely affect the operation of any Building Systems or the operations of any laboratory spaces within the Premises, and (z)    Installations    means all installed or affixed property of any kind paid for with the TI Fund, all Alterations, all fixtures, and all partitions, hardware, built-in machinery, built-in casework and cabinets and other similar additions, equipment, property and improvements built into the Premises so as to become an integral part of the Premises, including, without limitation, fume hoods which penetrate the roof or plenum area, installed cage washers, built-in cold rooms, built-in warm rooms, walk-in cold rooms, walk-in warm rooms, deionized water systems, HVAC, chillers, built-in plumbing, electrical and mechanical equipment and systems, and any installed power generator and transfer switch.

Landlord, as an Operating Expense, shall maintain all of the structural (including the roof and exterior walls), exterior, parking (including the subterranean garage) and other Common Areas of the Project, including HVAC, plumbing, fire sprinklers, elevators and all other building systems serving the Premises and other portions of the Project (   Building Systems   ), in good repair, reasonable wear and tear and uninsured losses and damages caused by Tenant, or by any of Tenant s assignees, sublessees, licensees, agents, servants, employees, invitees and contractors (or any of Tenant s assignees, sublessees and/or licensees respective agents, servants, employees, invitees and contractors) (each, a    Tenant Party    and collectively,    Tenant Parties   ) excluded.  Losses and damages caused by Tenant or any Tenant Party shall be repaired by Landlord, to the extent not covered by insurance, at Tenant s sole cost and expense.  Landlord reserves the right to stop Building Systems services when reasonably necessary (i) by reason of accident or emergency, or (ii) after delivery of written notice to Tenant and reasonable efforts to coordinate with Tenant to minimize disruption to Tenant s operations, for planned repairs, alterations or improvements, which are, in the judgment of Landlord, desirable or necessary to be made, until said repairs, alterations or improvements shall have been completed.  Landlord shall have no responsibility or liability for failure to supply Building Systems services during any such period of interruption;   provided  ,   however  , that Landlord shall, except in case of emergency, provide Tenant 5 days advance notice of any planned stoppage of Building Systems services for routine maintenance, repairs, alterations or improvements.  Tenant shall promptly give Landlord written notice of any repair required by Landlord pursuant to this Section of which Tenant is aware, after which Landlord shall make a commercially reasonable effort to effect such repair.  Landlord shall not be liable for any failure to make any repairs or to perform any maintenance unless such failure shall persist for an unreasonable time after Tenant s written notice of the need for such repairs or maintenance.  Tenant waives its rights under any state or local law to terminate this Lease or, except for the self-help rights provided for in   Section 31   below, to make such repairs at Landlord s expense and agrees that the parties  respective rights with respect to such matters shall be solely as set forth herein.  Repairs required as the result of fire, earthquake, flood, vandalism, war, or similar cause of damage or destruction shall be controlled by   Section 18  . 
  Tenant shall have the self-help rights provided for in   Section 31  . 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, as of the Rent Commencement Date, the maintenance and repair obligations for the Building shall be allocated between Landlord and Tenant as set forth on   Exhibit L   attached hereto.  The maintenance obligations allocated to Tenant pursuant to   Exhibit L   (the    Tenant Maintenance Obligations   ) shall be performed by Tenant at Tenant s sole cost and expense.  The Tenant Maintenance Obligations shall include the procurement and maintenance of contracts,  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 16 

   in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, with copies to Landlord upon Landlord s written request, for and with contractors reasonably acceptable to Landlord specializing and experienced in the respective Tenant Maintenance Obligations. If Landlord does not object to a contract provided by Tenant to Landlord for approval within 5 business days after Landlord s receipt of such contract from Tenant, such contract shall be deemed approved.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the scope of work of any such contracts entered into by Tenant pursuant to this paragraph shall, at a minimum, comply with manufacturer s recommended maintenance procedures for the optimal performance of the applicable equipment.  Landlord shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, have no obligation to perform any Tenant Maintenance Obligations. The Tenant Maintenance Obligations shall not include the right or obligation on the part of Tenant to make any structural and/or capital repairs or improvements to the Project, and Landlord shall, during any period that Tenant is responsible for the Tenant Maintenance Obligations, continue to be responsible, as part of Operating Expenses, for capital repairs and replacements required to be made to the Project.  If Tenant fails to maintain any portion of the Building for which Tenant is responsible as part of the Tenant Maintenance Obligations in a manner reasonably acceptable to Landlord within the requirements of this Lease, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to provide Tenant with written notice thereof and to assume the Tenant Maintenance Obligations if Tenant does not cure Tenant s failure within 30 days after receipt of such notice.   
  14.        Tenant s Repairs  .  Subject to   Section 13   hereof, Tenant, at its expense, shall repair, replace and maintain in good condition all portions of the Premises, including, without limitation, entries, doors, ceilings, interior windows, interior walls, and the interior side of demising walls.  Such repair and replacement may include capital expenditures and repairs whose benefit may extend beyond the Term.  Should Tenant fail to make any such repair or replacement or fail to maintain the Premises, Landlord shall give Tenant notice of such failure.  If Tenant fails to commence cure of such failure within 30 days of Landlord s notice, and thereafter diligently prosecute such cure to completion, Landlord may perform such work and shall be reimbursed by Tenant within 30 days after demand therefor; provided, however, that if such failure by Tenant creates or could create an emergency, Landlord may immediately commence cure of such failure and shall thereafter be entitled to recover the costs of such cure from Tenant.  Subject to   Sections 17   and   18  , Tenant shall bear the full uninsured cost of any repair or replacement to any part of the Project that results from damage caused by Tenant or any Tenant Party and any repair that benefits only the Premises. 
  15.        Mechanic s Liens  .  Tenant shall discharge, by bond or otherwise, any mechanic s lien filed against the Premises or against the Project for work claimed to have been done for, or materials claimed to have been furnished to, Tenant within 15 business days after the filing thereof, at Tenant s sole cost and shall otherwise keep the Premises and the Project free from any liens arising out of work performed, materials furnished or obligations incurred by Tenant.  Should Tenant fail to discharge any lien described herein, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to pay such claim or post a bond or otherwise provide security to eliminate the lien as a claim against title to the Project and the cost thereof shall be immediately due from Tenant as Additional Rent.  If Tenant shall lease or finance the acquisition of office equipment, furnishings, or other personal property of a removable nature utilized by Tenant in the operation of Tenant s business, Tenant warrants that any Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statement filed as a matter of public record by any lessor or creditor of Tenant will upon its face or by exhibit thereto indicate that such Financing Statement is applicable only to removable personal property of Tenant located within the Premises.  In no event shall the address of the Project be furnished on the statement without qualifying language as to applicability of the lien only to removable personal property, located in an identified suite held by Tenant.   
  16.        Indemnification  .  Tenant hereby indemnifies and agrees to defend, save and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all Claims for injury or death to persons or damage to property occurring within or about the Premises, arising directly or indirectly out of use or occupancy of the Premises or a breach or default by Tenant in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or negligence of Landlord.  Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for, and Tenant assumes all risk of damage to, personal property (including, without limitation, loss of records kept within the Premises).  Tenant further waives any and all Claims for injury to Tenant s business or loss of income relating to any such damage or destruction of personal property (including, without limitation, any loss of  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 17 

   records).  Landlord shall not be liable for any damages arising from any act, omission or neglect of any tenant in the Project or of any other third party. 
  Subject to all of the other provisions of this Lease including, without limitation, the waivers provided for in   Section 17  , Landlord hereby indemnifies and agrees to defend, save and hold Tenant harmless from and against any and all third party Claims for injury or death to persons or damage to property occurring at the Project (outside of the Premises) to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or negligence of Landlord. 
  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Lease, neither party shall be liable to the other party for any consequential damages arising under this Lease; provided that this sentence shall not apply to Landlord s damages (x) as expressly provided for in   Section 8  , and/or (y) in connection with Tenant s obligations as more fully set forth in   Section 30  .  In no event shall the foregoing limit the damages to which Landlord is entitled under   Section 21(c)(ii)(A)-(D)  .

All such insurance shall be included as part of the Operating Expenses.  The Project may be included in a blanket policy (in which case the cost of such insurance allocable to the Project will be reasonably determined by Landlord based upon the insurer s cost calculations).  At least 60% of the all risk capacity insurers under such blanket policy shall have a rating of not less than policyholder rating of A- and financial category rating of at least Class IX in  Best s Insurance Guide . Tenant shall also reimburse Landlord for any increased premiums or additional insurance which Landlord reasonably deems necessary as a result of the particular use of the Premises by Tenant or any Tenant Parties.     
  Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall maintain during the Term:  all risk property insurance with business interruption and extra expense coverage, covering the full replacement cost of all property and improvements installed or placed in the Premises by Tenant at Tenant s expense; workers  compensation insurance with no less than the minimum limits required by law; employer s liability insurance with such limits as required by law; and commercial general liability insurance, with a minimum limit of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage with respect to the Premises.

Certificates of insurance showing the limits of coverage required hereunder and showing Landlord as an additional insured shall be delivered to Landlord by Tenant prior to (i) the earlier to occur of  (x) the Commencement Date, or (y) the date that Tenant accesses the Premises under this Lease, and (ii) each renewal of said insurance.  Tenant s policy may be a  blanket policy  with an aggregate per location endorsement which specifically provides that the amount of insurance shall not be prejudiced by other losses covered by the policy.  Tenant shall, at least 5 days prior to the expiration of such policies, furnish Landlord with renewal certificates. 

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 18 

   In each instance where insurance is to name Landlord as an additional insured, Tenant shall upon written request of Landlord also designate and furnish certificates so evidencing Landlord as additional insured to:  (i) any lender of Landlord holding a security interest in the Project or any portion thereof, (ii) the landlord under any lease wherein Landlord is tenant of the real property on which the Project is located, if the interest of Landlord is or shall become that of a tenant under a ground or other underlying lease rather than that of a fee owner, and/or (iii) any management company retained by Landlord to manage the Project. 
  Notwithstanding anything in this   Section 17   to the contrary, for so long as Tenant can provide Landlord with reasonably acceptable evidence that Tenant is maintaining an equity market cap of not less than $15,000,000,000, Tenant may self-insure for the insurance required by Tenant to be maintained pursuant to this   Section 17  .  With respect to Tenant s self-insurance, Landlord and Tenant agree as follows: (a) that Tenant s self-insurance shall be treated as actual insurance and that such self-insurance shall be the primary coverage for every risk for which Tenant is liable or responsible hereunder; (b) the waiver of subrogation provisions set forth in this Lease shall apply to Tenant s self-insurance as though Tenant were maintaining the insurance required under this Lease, (c) Tenant shall bear the entire cost of the defense of any claim for which it is responsible under the terms of this Lease including, without limitation, the defense of Landlord, and (d) Tenant shall use its own funds to pay any claim or indemnity or replace any property or otherwise provide the funding which would have been available from insurance proceeds but for Tenant s election to self-insure.  If Tenant elects to self-insure, Landlord shall be considered to be covered by the same insurance terms, including, but not limited to, insuring grants, exclusions, conditions and limits, by which it would have been covered had insurance covering such risk been in effect.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Tenant hereby releases Landlord from any liability for loss or damage caused by Landlord and/or any Landlord Party against which Tenant has elected to self-insure but which Tenant would otherwise be required to insure against under this Lease and in no event shall Landlord be liable for any loss or damage which Landlord would not otherwise be responsible but for Tenant s election to self insure.  The right to self-insure shall only apply to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated. 
  The property insurance obtained by Landlord and Tenant shall include a waiver of subrogation by the insurers and all rights based upon an assignment from its insured, against Landlord or Tenant, and their respective officers, directors, employees, managers, agents, invitees and contractors (   Related Parties   ), in connection with any loss or damage thereby insured against.  Neither party nor its respective Related Parties shall be liable to the other for loss or damage caused by any risk insured against under property insurance required to be maintained hereunder, and each party waives any claims against the other party, and its respective Related Parties, for such loss or damage.  The failure of a party to insure its property shall not void this waiver.  Landlord and its respective Related Parties shall not be liable for, and Tenant hereby waives all claims against such parties for, business interruption and losses occasioned thereby sustained by Tenant or any person claiming through Tenant resulting from any accident or occurrence in or upon the Premises or the Project from any cause whatsoever.  If the foregoing waivers shall contravene any law with respect to exculpatory agreements, the liability of Landlord or Tenant shall be deemed not released but shall be secondary to the other s insurer. 
  Landlord may require insurance policy limits described in this   Section 17   to be raised to conform with requirements of Landlord s lender and/or insurance consultants; provided, however, that the increased amount of coverage is consistent with coverage amounts then being required by institutional owners of Class A buildings in the Torrey Pines area of San Diego other than Landlord and affiliates of Landlord. 
  18.        Restoration  .  If, at any time during the Term, the Premises are damaged or destroyed by a fire or other casualty, Landlord shall notify Tenant within 60 days after discovery of such damage as to the amount of time Landlord reasonably estimates it will take to restore the Premises, as applicable (the    Restoration Period   ).  If the Restoration Period is estimated to exceed 12 months (the    Maximum Restoration Period   ), or if Landlord reasonably determines such casualty to be an uninsured casualty, Landlord may, in such notice, elect to terminate this Lease as of the date that is 75 days after the date of discovery of such damage or destruction;   provided, however  , that notwithstanding Landlord s election to restore, Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord delivered within 15 business  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 19 

   days of receipt of a notice from Landlord estimating a Restoration Period for the Premises longer than the Maximum Restoration Period.  Unless either Landlord or Tenant so elects to terminate this Lease, Landlord shall, subject to receipt of sufficient insurance proceeds other than any shortfall resulting from Landlord s failure to maintain the insurance required to be maintained by Landlord pursuant to   Section 17   (with any deductible to be treated as an Operating Expense subject to and in accordance with   Section 5  ), use good faith efforts to promptly restore the Premises (excluding the improvements installed by Tenant or by Landlord and paid for by Tenant), subject to delays arising from the collection of insurance proceeds, from Force Majeure events or as needed to obtain any license, clearance or other authorization of any kind required to enter into and restore the Premises issued by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the use, storage, handling, treatment, generation, release, disposal, removal or remediation of Hazardous Materials (as defined in   Section 30  ) in, on or about the Premises (collectively referred to herein as    Hazardous Materials Clearances      provided  ,   however  , that if repair or restoration of the Premises is not substantially complete as of the end of the Maximum Restoration Period or, if longer, the Restoration Period, Landlord may, in its sole and absolute discretion, by written notice to Tenant delivered within 15 business days of the expiration of the Maximum Restoration Period or, if longer, the Restoration Period elect not to proceed with such repair and restoration, or Tenant may by written notice to Landlord delivered within 15 business days of the expiration of the Maximum Restoration Period or, if longer, the Restoration Period, elect to terminate this Lease, in which event Landlord shall be relieved of its obligation to make such repairs or restoration and this Lease shall terminate as of the date that is 75 days after the later of:  (i) discovery of such damage or destruction, or (ii) the date all required Hazardous Materials Clearances are obtained. 
  Tenant, at its expense, shall promptly perform, subject to delays arising from the collection of insurance proceeds, from Force Majeure (as defined in   Section 34  ) events or to obtain Hazardous Material Clearances, all repairs or restoration not required to be done by Landlord and shall promptly re-enter the Premises and commence doing business in accordance with this Lease.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease upon written notice to the other if the Premises are damaged during the last year of the Term and Landlord reasonably estimates that it will take more than 2 months to repair such damage; provided, however, that such notice is delivered within 10 business days after the date that Landlord provides Tenant with written notice of the estimated Restoration Period.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Landlord shall also have the right to terminate this Lease if Landlord maintains the insurance required to be maintained by Landlord under this Lease, but insurance proceeds are not available for such restoration.  Rent shall be equitably and proportionately abated from the date of discovery of the damage or destruction until occupancy of the Premises is legally permitted, in the proportion to which the area of the Premises, if any, which is not usable by Tenant bears to the total area of the Premises; provided, however, that if Tenant fails to obtain any Hazardous Materials Clearances required in order for Landlord to access the Premises (or any portion thereof) or for Landlord to perform repair or reconstruction activities within 60 days after the date of discovery of the damage or destruction, then Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement following such initial 60 day period and shall be required to pay Rent for the Premises during any period following such initial 60 day period that Landlord s access to the Premises (or any portion thereof) or Landlord s repair or reconstruction activities are delayed in any way solely as a result of Tenant s failure to obtain any Hazardous Materials Clearances.  Such abatement shall be the sole remedy of Tenant, and except as provided in this   Section 18  , Tenant waives any right to terminate the Lease by reason of damage or casualty loss. 
  The provisions of this Lease, including this   Section 18  , constitute an express agreement between Landlord and Tenant with respect to any and all damage to, or destruction of, all or any part of the Premises, or any other portion of the Project, and any statute or regulation which is now or may hereafter be in effect shall have no application to this Lease or any damage or destruction to all or any part of the Premises or any other portion of the Project, the parties hereto expressly agreeing that this   Section 18   sets forth their entire understanding and agreement with respect to such matters. 
  19.        Condemnation  .  If the whole or any material part of the Premises or the Project is taken for any public or quasi-public use under governmental law, ordinance, or regulation, or by right of eminent domain, or by private purchase in lieu thereof (a    Taking    or    Taken   ), and the Taking would in Landlord s  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 20 

   reasonable judgment, materially interfere with or impair Landlord s ownership or operation of the Project or would in the reasonable judgment of Landlord and Tenant either prevent or materially interfere with Tenant s use of the Premises (as resolved, if the parties are unable to agree, by arbitration by a single arbitrator with the qualifications and experience appropriate to resolve the matter and appointed pursuant to and acting in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association), then upon written notice by Landlord or Tenant to the other this Lease shall terminate and Rent shall be apportioned as of said date.  If part of the Premises shall be Taken, and this Lease is not terminated as provided above, Landlord shall promptly restore the Premises and the Project as nearly as is commercially reasonable under the circumstances to their condition prior to such partial Taking and the rentable square footage of the Building, the rentable square footage of the Premises, Tenant s Share of Operating Expenses and the Rent payable hereunder during the unexpired Term shall be reduced to such extent as may be fair and reasonable under the circumstances.  Upon any such Taking, Landlord shall be entitled to receive the entire price or award from any such Taking without any payment to Tenant, and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord Tenant s interest, if any, in such award.  Tenant shall have the right, to the extent that same shall not diminish Landlord s award, to make a separate claim against the condemning authority (but not Landlord) for such compensation as may be separately awarded or recoverable by Tenant for moving expenses and damage to Tenant s trade fixtures, if a separate award for such items is made to Tenant.  Tenant hereby waives any and all rights it might otherwise have pursuant to any provision of state law to terminate this Lease upon a partial Taking of the Premises or the Project. 
  20.        Events of Default  .  Each of the following events shall be a default (   Default   ) by Tenant under this Lease: 
  (a)        Payment Defaults  .  Tenant shall fail to pay any installment of Rent or any other payment hereunder when due; provided, however, that Landlord will give Tenant written notice and an opportunity to cure any failure to pay Rent within 5 days of any such notice not more than twice in any 12 month period and Tenant agrees that such notice shall be in lieu of and not in addition to, or shall be deemed to be, any notice required by law. 
  (b)        Insurance  .  Any insurance required to be maintained by Tenant pursuant to this Lease shall be canceled or terminated or shall expire or shall be reduced or materially changed, or Landlord shall receive a notice of nonrenewal of any such insurance and Tenant shall fail to obtain replacement insurance before the expiration of the current coverage. 
  (c)        Abandonment  .  Tenant shall abandon the Premises.  Tenant shall not be deemed to have abandoned the Premises if (i) Tenant provides Landlord with advance notice prior to vacating and, at the time of or during a reasonable time after vacating the Premises, Tenant completes Tenant s obligations with respect to the Surrender Plan in compliance with   Section 28  , (ii) Tenant has made reasonable arrangements reasonably acceptable to Landlord for the security of the Premises for the balance of the Term, and (iii) Tenant continues during the balance of the Term to satisfy all of its obligations under the Lease as they come due. 
  (d)        Improper Transfer  .  Tenant shall assign, sublease or otherwise transfer all or any portion of Tenant s interest in this Lease or the Premises except as expressly permitted herein, or Tenant s interest in this Lease shall be attached, executed upon, or otherwise judicially seized and such action is not released within 90 days of the action. 
  (e)        Liens  .  Tenant shall fail to discharge or otherwise obtain the release of any lien placed upon the Premises in violation of this Lease within 15 business days after any such lien is filed against the Premises. 
  (f)        Insolvency Events  .  Tenant or any guarantor or surety of Tenant s obligations hereunder shall:  (A) make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (B) commence any case, proceeding or other action seeking to have an order for relief entered on its behalf as a debtor or to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, liquidation, dissolution or composition of  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 21 

   it or its debts or seeking appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for all or of any substantial part of its property (collectively a    Proceeding for Relief    (C) become the subject of any Proceeding for Relief which is not dismissed within 90 days of its filing or entry; or (D) be dissolved or otherwise fail to maintain its legal existence (if Tenant, guarantor or surety is a corporation, partnership or other entity). 
  (g)        Estoppel Certificate or Subordination Agreement  .  Tenant fails to execute any document required from Tenant under   Sections 23   or   27   within 10 days after a second notice requesting such document. 
  (h)        Other Defaults  .  Tenant shall fail to comply with any provision of this Lease other than those specifically referred to in this   Section 20  , and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such failure shall continue for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant. 
  Any notice given under   Section 20(h)   hereof shall:  (i) specify the alleged default, (ii) demand that Tenant cure such default, (iii) be in lieu of, and not in addition to, or shall be deemed to be, any notice required under any provision of applicable law, and (iv) not be deemed a forfeiture or a termination of this Lease unless Landlord elects otherwise in such notice;   provided   that if the nature of Tenant s default pursuant to   Section 20(h)   is such that it cannot be cured by the payment of money and reasonably requires more than 30 days to cure, then Tenant shall not be deemed to be in default if Tenant commences such cure within said 30 day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to completion;   provided  ,   however  , that such cure shall be completed no later than 90 days from the date of Landlord s notice. 
  21.        Landlord s Remedies  . 
  (a)        Payment By Landlord; Interest  .  Upon a Default by Tenant hereunder, Landlord may, without waiving or releasing any obligation of Tenant hereunder, make such payment or perform such act.  All sums so paid or incurred by Landlord, together with interest thereon, from the date such sums were paid or incurred, at the annual rate equal to 12% per annum or the highest rate permitted by law (the    Default Rate   ), whichever is less, shall be payable to Landlord on demand as Additional Rent.  Nothing herein shall be construed to create or impose a duty on Landlord to mitigate any damages resulting from Tenant s Default hereunder. 
  (b)        Late Payment Rent  .  Late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Rent and other sums due will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain.  Such costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting charges and late charges which may be imposed on Landlord under any Mortgage covering the Premises.  Therefore, if any installment of Rent due from Tenant is not received by Landlord within 5 days after the date such payment is due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an additional sum equal to 6% of the overdue Rent as a late charge.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, before assessing a late charge the first time in any calendar year, Landlord shall provide Tenant written notice of the delinquency and will waive the right if Tenant pays such delinquency within 5 days thereafter.      The parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Landlord will incur by reason of late payment by Tenant.  In addition to the late charge, Rent not paid when due shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the 5th day after the date due until paid. 
  (c)        Remedies  .  Upon the occurrence of a Default, Landlord, at its option, without further notice or demand to Tenant, shall have in addition to all other rights and remedies provided in this Lease, at law or in equity, the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies, each and all of which shall be cumulative and nonexclusive, without any notice or demand whatsoever. 
  (i)        Terminate this Lease, or at Landlord s option, Tenant s right to possession only, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord, and if Tenant fails to do so, Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in rent, enter upon and take possession of the Premises and expel or remove Tenant  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 22 

   and any other person who may be occupying the Premises or any part thereof, without being liable for prosecution or any claim or damages therefor; 
  (ii)        Upon any termination of this Lease, whether pursuant to the foregoing   Section 21(c)(i)   or otherwise, due to a Default by Tenant, Landlord may recover from Tenant the following: 
  (A)        The worth at the time of award of any unpaid rent which has been earned at the time of such termination; plus 
  (B)        The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus 
  (C)        The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; and 
  (D)        Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, specifically including, but not limited to, brokerage commissions and advertising expenses incurred, expenses of remodeling the Premises or any portion thereof for a new tenant, whether for the same or a different use, and any special concessions made to obtain a new tenant. 
  The term    rent    as used in this   Section 21   shall be deemed to be and to mean all sums of every nature required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease, whether to Landlord or to others.  As used in   Sections 21(c)(ii)(A)   and   (B)  , above, the    worth at the time of award    shall be computed by allowing interest at the Default Rate.  As used in   Section 21(c)(ii)(C)   above, the    worth at the time of award    shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus 1%. 
  (iii)        Landlord may continue this Lease in effect after Tenant s Default and recover rent as it becomes due (Landlord and Tenant hereby agreeing that Tenant has the right to sublet or assign hereunder, subject only to reasonable limitations).  Accordingly, if Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease following a Default by Tenant, Landlord may, from time to time, without terminating this Lease, enforce all of its rights and remedies hereunder, including the right to recover all Rent as it becomes due. 
  (iv)        If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease following a Default by Tenant, Landlord shall have the right, subject to the terms of any agreements of subordination or nondisturbance entered into by Landlord, to terminate any and all subleases, licenses, concessions or other consensual arrangements for possession entered into by Tenant and affecting the Premises or may, in Landlord s sole discretion, succeed to Tenant s interest in such subleases, licenses, concessions or arrangements.  Upon Landlord s election to succeed to Tenant s interest in any such subleases, licenses, concessions or arrangements, Tenant shall, as of the date of notice by Landlord of such election, have no further right to or interest in the rent or other consideration receivable thereunder. 
  (v)        Independent of the exercise of any other remedy of Landlord hereunder or under applicable law, Landlord may conduct an environmental test of the Premises as generally described in   Section 30(d)   hereof, at Tenant s expense. 
  (d)        Effect of Exercise  .  Exercise by Landlord of any remedies hereunder or otherwise available shall not be deemed to be an acceptance of surrender of the Premises and/or a termination of this Lease by Landlord, it being understood that such surrender and/or termination can be effected only by the express  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 23 

   written agreement of Landlord and Tenant.  Any law, usage, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding, Landlord shall have the right at all times to enforce the provisions of this Lease in strict accordance with the terms hereof; and the failure of Landlord at any time to enforce its rights under this Lease strictly in accordance with same shall not be construed as having created a custom in any way or manner contrary to the specific terms, provisions, and covenants of this Lease or as having modified the same and shall not be deemed a waiver of Landlord s right to enforce one or more of its rights in connection with any subsequent default.  A receipt by Landlord of Rent or other payment with knowledge of the breach of any covenant hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach, and no waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease shall be deemed to have been made unless expressed in writing and signed by Landlord.  To the greatest extent permitted by law, Tenant waives the service of notice of Landlord s intention to re-enter, re-take or otherwise obtain possession of the Premises as provided in any statute, or to institute legal proceedings to that end, and also waives all right of redemption in case Tenant shall be dispossessed by a judgment or by warrant of any court or judge.  Any reletting of the Premises or any portion thereof shall be on such terms and conditions as Landlord in its sole discretion may determine.  Landlord shall not be liable for, nor shall Tenant s obligations hereunder be diminished because of, Landlord s failure to relet the Premises or collect rent due in respect of such reletting or otherwise to mitigate any damages arising by reason of Tenant s Default.  Landlord shall, however, use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the damages arising by reason of the termination of this Lease as a result of a Default by Tenant; provided, however, that in no event shall mitigation require Landlord to consider, among other things, (i) any tenant which does not satisfy Landlord s then current underwriting criteria, in the exercise of Landlord s sole and absolute discretion, for comparable size premises, (ii) subdividing the Premises unless Landlord elects in its sole and absolute discretion to do so, (iii) any change in use of the Premises or any alterations which would lessen the value of the leasehold improvements, (iv) granting any tenant improvement allowances, free rent or other lease concessions, or (v) accepting any tenant if Landlord would have the right to reject such tenant if such tenant were a proposed assignee or sublessee of Tenant including, without limitation, considering the factors described in   Section 22(b)  . 
  22.        Assignment and Subletting  . 
  (a)        General Prohibition  .  Without Landlord s prior written consent subject to and on the conditions described in this   Section 22  , Tenant shall not, directly or indirectly, voluntarily or by operation of law, assign this Lease or sublease the Premises or any part thereof or mortgage, pledge, or hypothecate its leasehold interest or grant any concession or license within the Premises, and any attempt to do any of the foregoing shall be void and of no effect.  If Tenant is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, the shares or other ownership interests thereof which are not actively traded upon a stock exchange or in the over-the-counter market, a transfer or series of transfers whereby 50% or more of the issued and outstanding shares or other ownership interests of such corporation, partnership or limited liability company are, or voting control is, transferred (but excepting transfers upon deaths of individual owners) from a person or persons or entity or entities which were owners thereof at time of execution of this Lease to persons or entities who were not owners of shares or other ownership interests of the corporation, partnership or limited liability company at time of execution of this Lease, shall be deemed an assignment of this Lease requiring the consent of Landlord as provided in this   Section 22  .   
  (b)        Permitted Transfers  .  If Tenant desires to assign, sublease, hypothecate or otherwise transfer this Lease or sublet the Premises other than pursuant to a Permitted Assignment (as defined below), then at least 15 days, but not more than 60 days, before the date Tenant desires the assignment or sublease to be effective (the    Assignment Date   ), Tenant shall give Landlord a notice (the    Assignment Notice   ) containing such information about the proposed assignee or sublessee, including the proposed use of the Premises and any Hazardous Materials proposed to be used, stored handled, treated, generated in or released or disposed of from the Premises, the Assignment Date, any relationship between Tenant and the proposed assignee or sublessee, and all material terms and conditions of the proposed assignment or sublease, including a copy of any proposed assignment or sublease in its final form, and such other information as Landlord may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate to its consideration whether to grant its consent. Landlord shall, by giving written notice to Tenant within 15 days after receipt of the Assignment Notice, either:   

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 24 

   (i) grant such consent (provided that Landlord shall further be entitled to a copy of the final signed form of sublease prior to the effective date of any such subletting to confirm that it conforms to the draft previously provided by Tenant), (ii) refuse such consent, in its reasonable discretion; or (iii) as to an assignment of the entire Lease for the remainder of the Term, terminate this Lease as of the Assignment Date (an    Assignment Termination   ). Among other reasons, it shall be reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent in any of these instances:  (1) the proposed assignee or subtenant is a governmental agency; (2) in Landlord s reasonable judgment, the use of the Premises by the proposed assignee or subtenant would entail any alterations that would materially lessen the value of the leasehold improvements in the Premises, or would require materially increased services by Landlord; (3) the use of the Premises by the proposed assignee or subtenant would not be consistent with the uses in general of laboratory tenants in Class A buildings in the Torrey Pines area of San Diego; (4) in Landlord s reasonable judgment, the proposed assignee or subtenant lacks the creditworthiness to support the financial obligations it will incur under the proposed assignment or sublease; (5) in Landlord s reasonable judgment, the character, reputation, or business of the proposed assignee or subtenant is materially detrimental to the Project; (6) Landlord has received from any prior landlord to the proposed assignee or subtenant a materially negative report concerning such prior landlord s experience with the proposed assignee or subtenant; (7) Landlord has experienced previous defaults by or is in litigation with the proposed assignee or subtenant; (8) the use of the Premises by the proposed assignee or subtenant will violate any applicable Legal Requirement; or (9) until all of the rentable square footage of the Spectrum 3 Building has been leased at least once, the proposed assignee or subtenant is an entity with whom Landlord is then actively negotiating to lease space in the Project.  If Landlord delivers notice of its election to exercise an Assignment Termination, Tenant shall have the right to withdraw such Assignment Notice by written notice to Landlord of such election within 5 business days after Landlord s notice electing to exercise the Assignment Termination.  If Tenant withdraws such Assignment Notice, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect.  If Tenant does not withdraw such Assignment Notice, this Lease, and the term and estate herein granted, shall terminate as of the Assignment Date.  No failure of Landlord to exercise any such option to terminate this Lease, or to deliver a timely notice in response to the Assignment Notice, shall be deemed to be Landlord s consent to the proposed assignment, sublease or other transfer.  Tenant shall pay to Landlord a fee equal to One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500) in connection with its consideration of any Assignment Notice and/or its preparation or review of any consent documents.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord s consent to an assignment of this Lease or a subletting of any portion of the Premises to any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with Tenant (a    Control Permitted Assignment   ) shall not be required, provided that Landlord shall have the right to approve the form of any such sublease or assignment.  In addition, Tenant shall have the right to assign this Lease, upon 30 days prior written notice to Landlord but without obtaining Landlord s prior written consent, to a corporation or other entity which is a successor-in-interest to Tenant, by way of merger, consolidation or corporate reorganization, or by the purchase of all or substantially all of the assets or the ownership interests of Tenant provided that (i) such merger or consolidation, or such acquisition or assumption, as the case may be, is for a good business purpose and not principally for the purpose of transferring the Lease, and (ii) the net worth (the excess of total  assets  over total  liabilities  using the definitions of  assets  and  liabilities  promulgated under generally accepted accounting principles (   GAAP   )) of the assignee is not less than the greater of the net worth (as determined above and as evidenced by a certification from the Chief Financial Officer of such assignee) of Tenant as of (A) the Commencement Date, or (B) as of the date of the assignment, and (iii) such assignee shall agree in writing to assume all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease (a    Corporate Permitted Assignment   ).      Control Permitted Assignments and Corporate Permitted Assignments are hereinafter referred to as    Permitted Assignments  .  
  (c)        Additional Conditions  .  As a condition to any such assignment or subletting, whether or not Landlord s consent is required, Landlord may require: 
  (i)        that any assignee or subtenant agree, in writing at the time of such assignment or subletting, that if Landlord gives such party notice that Tenant is in default under this Lease, such party shall thereafter make all payments otherwise due Tenant directly to Landlord, which payments will be received by Landlord without any liability except to credit such payment against those due under the Lease, and any such third party shall agree to attorn to Landlord or its successors and  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 25 

   assigns should this Lease be terminated for any reason;   provided  ,   however  , in no event shall Landlord or its successors or assigns be obligated to accept such attornment; and 
  (ii)        A list of Hazardous Materials, certified by the proposed assignee or sublessee to be true and correct, which the proposed assignee or sublessee intends to use, store, handle, treat, generate in or release or dispose of from the Premises, together with copies of all documents relating to such use, storage, handling, treatment, generation, release or disposal of Hazardous Materials by the proposed assignee or subtenant in the Premises or on the Project, prior to the proposed assignment or subletting, including, without limitation:  permits; approvals and reports; storage and management plans; plans relating to the installation of any storage tanks to be installed at the Project (provided, said installation of tanks shall only be permitted after Landlord has given its written consent to do so, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and all closure plans or any other documents required by any and all federal, state and local Governmental Authorities for any storage tanks installed in, on or under the Project for the closure of any such tanks.  Neither Tenant nor any such proposed assignee or subtenant is required, however, to provide Landlord with any portion(s) of such documents containing information of a proprietary nature which, in and of themselves, do not contain a reference to any Hazardous Materials or hazardous activities. 
  (d)        No Release of Tenant, Sharing of Excess Rents  .  Notwithstanding any assignment or subletting, Tenant and any guarantor or surety of Tenant s obligations under this Lease shall at all times remain fully and primarily responsible and liable for the payment of Rent and for compliance with all of Tenant s other obligations under this Lease.  Except in connection with any Permitted Assignment, if the Rent due and payable by a sublessee or assignee (or a combination of the rental payable under such sublease or assignment plus any bonus or other consideration therefor or incident thereto in any form) exceeds the sum of     the rental payable under this Lease, in the case of a sublease as allocated to the space subject to the sublease, (excluding however, any Rent payable under this Section) plus the actual and reasonable brokerage fees, legal costs, lease concessions and any design or construction fees directly related to and required pursuant to the terms of any such sublease (with all such amounts amortized over the term of the sublease or, in the case of an assignment, the then-remaining term of the Lease) (   Excess Rent   ), then Tenant shall be bound and obligated to pay Landlord as Additional Rent hereunder 50% of such Excess Rent within 10 days following receipt thereof by Tenant.  If Tenant shall sublet the Premises or any part thereof, Tenant hereby immediately and irrevocably assigns to Landlord, as security for Tenant s obligations under this Lease, all rent from any such subletting, and Landlord as assignee for Tenant, or a receiver for Tenant appointed on Landlord s application, may collect such rent and apply it toward Tenant s obligations under this Lease; except that, until the occurrence of a Default, Tenant shall have the right to collect such rent. 
  (e)        No Waiver  .  The consent by Landlord to an assignment or subletting shall not relieve Tenant or any assignees of this Lease or any sublessees of the Premises from obtaining the consent of Landlord to any further assignment or subletting nor shall it release Tenant or any assignee or sublessee of Tenant from full and primary liability under the Lease.  The acceptance of Rent hereunder, or the acceptance of performance of any other term, covenant, or condition thereof, from any other person or entity shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any of the provisions of this Lease or a consent to any subletting, assignment or other transfer of the Premises. 
  (f)        Intentionally Omitted  .     
  23.        Estoppel Certificate  .  Tenant shall, within 10 business days of written notice from Landlord, execute, acknowledge and deliver a statement in writing in any form reasonably requested by a proposed lender or purchaser, (i) certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified, stating the nature of such modification and certifying that this Lease as so modified is in full force and effect) and the dates to which the rental and other charges are paid in advance, if any, (ii) acknowledging that there are not any uncured defaults on the part of Landlord hereunder, or specifying such defaults if any are claimed, and (iii) setting forth such further information with respect to the status of this Lease or the Premises as may  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 26 

   be reasonably requested by a prospective bona fide third party purchaser or encumbrancer.  Any such statement may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of all or any portion of the real property of which the Premises are a part.  Tenant s failure to deliver such statement within 10 days after Landlord s delivery to Tenant of a second written request therefor, shall be conclusive upon Tenant that the Lease is in full force and effect and without modification except as may be represented by Landlord in any certificate prepared by Landlord and delivered to Tenant for execution.  
  Landlord shall, within 10 business days of written notice from Tenant, execute an estoppel certificate (which may include good faith and factually correct comments by Landlord) to Tenant s bona fide third party lender, an assignee pursuant to a Permitted Assignment, or an approved subtenant or assignee:  (i) certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified, stating the nature of such modification and certifying that this Lease as so modified is in full force and effect) and the dates to which the rental and other charges are paid in advanced, if any, (ii) acknowledging that there are not, to Landlord s actual knowledge, Defaults on the part of Tenant hereunder, or specifying such Defaults if any are claimed and (iii) setting forth such further information with respect to the status of this Lease or the Premises as may be reasonably requested thereon. 
  24.        Quiet Enjoyment  .  So long as Tenant is not in Default under this Lease, Tenant shall, subject to the terms of this Lease, at all times during the Term, have peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the Premises against any person claiming by, through or under Landlord. 
  25.        Prorations  .  All prorations required or permitted to be made hereunder shall be made on the basis of a 360 day year and 30 day months. 
  26.        Rules and Regulations  .  Tenant shall, at all times during the Term, comply with the rules and regulations attached hereto, and with reasonable, non-discriminatory, new written rules and regulations from time to time established by Landlord covering the use of the Premises or the Project.  Any new rules and regulations imposed by Landlord pursuant to this   Section 26   shall not (i) materially adversely affect Tenant s parking, access to or use of the Premises for the Permitted Use, (ii) materially increase Tenant s financial obligations to Landlord under this Lease in a manner not otherwise contemplated by the other provisions of this Lease, and/or (iii) materially adversely affect Tenant s rights or obligations under this Lease.  The current rules and regulations are attached hereto as   Exhibit E  .  If there is any conflict between said rules and regulations (including any later promulgated rules and regulations) and other provisions of this Lease, the terms and provisions of this Lease shall control.  Landlord shall not have any liability or obligation for the breach of any rules or regulations by other tenants in the Project and Landlord shall not enforce such rules and regulations in a discriminatory manner among tenants in the Project. 
  27.        Subordination  .  This Lease and Tenant s interest and rights hereunder are hereby made and shall be subject and subordinate at all times to the lien of any Mortgage now existing or hereafter created on or against the Project or the Premises, and all amendments, restatements, renewals, modifications, consolidations, refinancing, assignments and extensions thereof, without the necessity of any further instrument or act on the part of Tenant;   provided  ,   however   that so long as there is no Default hereunder, Tenant s rights set forth in this Lease including its rights to use, occupy and possess the Premises shall not be disturbed by the Holder of any such Mortgage.  Tenant agrees, at the election of the Holder of any such Mortgage, to attorn to any such Holder.  Tenant agrees upon demand to execute, acknowledge and deliver such instruments, confirming such subordination, and such instruments of attornment as shall be requested by any such Holder, provided any such instruments contain appropriate non-disturbance provisions assuring Tenant s quiet enjoyment of the Premises as set forth in   Section 24   hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Holder may at any time subordinate its Mortgage to this Lease, without Tenant s consent, by notice in writing to Tenant, and thereupon this Lease shall be deemed prior to such Mortgage without regard to their respective dates of execution, delivery or recording and in that event such Holder shall have the same rights with respect to this Lease as though this Lease had been executed prior to the execution, delivery and recording of such Mortgage and had been assigned to such Holder.  The term    Mortgage    whenever used in this Lease shall be deemed to include deeds of trust, security assignments and any other  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 27 

   encumbrances, and any reference to the    Holder    of a Mortgage shall be deemed to include the beneficiary under a deed of trust.  As of the date of this Lease, there is no existing Mortgage encumbering  the Project. 
  28.        Surrender  .  Upon the expiration of the Term or earlier termination of Tenant s right of possession, Tenant shall surrender the Premises to Landlord in the same condition as received, subject to any Alterations or Installations permitted by Landlord to remain in the Premises, free of Hazardous Materials brought upon, kept, used, stored, handled, treated, generated in, or released or disposed of from, the Premises by any person other than a Landlord Party during the Term or any holding over (collectively,    Tenant HazMat Operations   ) and released of all Hazardous Materials Clearances, if any, broom clean, ordinary wear and tear and casualty loss and condemnation covered by   Sections 18   and   19   excepted.  At least 3 months prior to the surrender of the Premises, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a narrative description of the actions proposed (or required by any Governmental Authority) to be taken by Tenant in order to surrender the Premises (including any Installations permitted by Landlord to remain in the Premises) at the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, free from any residual impact from the Tenant HazMat Operations and otherwise released for unrestricted use and occupancy (the    Surrender Plan   ).  Such Surrender Plan shall be accompanied by a current listing of (i) all Hazardous Materials licenses and permits held by or on behalf of any Tenant Party with respect to the Premises, and (ii) all Hazardous Materials used, stored, handled, treated, generated, released or disposed of from the Premises, and shall be subject to the review and reasonable approval of Landlord s environmental consultant.  In connection with the review and approval of the Surrender Plan, upon the request of Landlord, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord or its consultant such additional non-proprietary information concerning Tenant HazMat Operations as Landlord shall reasonably request.  On or before such surrender, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord evidence that the approved Surrender Plan shall have been satisfactorily completed and Landlord shall have the right, subject to reimbursement at Tenant s expense as set forth below, to cause Landlord s environmental consultant to inspect the Premises and perform such additional procedures as may be deemed reasonably necessary to confirm that the Premises are, as of the effective date of such surrender or early termination of the Lease, free from any residual impact from Tenant HazMat Operations.  Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as Additional Rent, for the reasonable, actual out-of pocket expense incurred by Landlord for Landlord s environmental consultant to review and approve the Surrender Plan and to visit the Premises and verify satisfactory completion of the same, which cost shall not exceed $5,000.  Landlord shall have the unrestricted right to deliver such Surrender Plan and any report by Landlord s environmental consultant with respect to the surrender of the Premises to third parties.  
  If Tenant shall fail to prepare or submit a Surrender Plan approved by Landlord, or if Tenant shall fail to complete the approved Surrender Plan, or if such Surrender Plan, whether or not approved by Landlord, shall fail to adequately address any residual effect of Tenant HazMat Operations in, on or about the Premises, Landlord shall have the right to take such actions as Landlord may deem reasonable or appropriate to assure that the Premises and the Project are surrendered free from any residual impact from Tenant HazMat Operations, the reasonable cost of which actions shall be reimbursed by Tenant as Additional Rent, without regard to the limitation set forth in the first paragraph of this   Section 28  . 
  Tenant shall immediately return to Landlord all keys and/or access cards to parking, the Project, restrooms or all or any portion of the Premises furnished to or otherwise procured by Tenant.  If any such access card or key is lost, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, at Landlord s election, either the cost of replacing such lost access card or key or the cost of reprogramming the access security system in which such access card was used or changing the lock or locks opened by such lost key.  Any Tenant s Property, Alterations and property not so removed by Tenant as permitted or required herein shall be deemed abandoned and may be stored, removed, and disposed of by Landlord at Tenant s expense, and Tenant waives all claims against Landlord for any damages resulting from Landlord s retention and/or disposition of such property.  All obligations of Tenant hereunder not fully performed as of the termination of the Term, including the obligations of Tenant under   Section 30   hereof, shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, including, without limitation, indemnity obligations, payment obligations with respect to Rent and obligations concerning the condition and repair of the Premises. 

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 28 

   29.        Waiver of Jury Trial  .  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TENANT AND LANDLORD WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO HAVE A JURY PARTICIPATE IN RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT ARISING OUT OF THIS LEASE OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT, OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO. 
  30.        Environmental Requirements  . 
  (a)        Prohibition/Compliance/Indemnity  .  Tenant shall not cause or permit any Hazardous Materials (as hereinafter defined) to be brought upon, kept, used, stored, handled, treated, generated  in or about, or released or disposed of from, the Premises or the Project by Tenant or any Tenant Party in violation of applicable Environmental Requirements (as hereinafter defined).  Subject to the provisions of the last sentence of this   Section 30(a)  , if Tenant breaches the obligation stated in the preceding sentence, or if the presence of Hazardous Materials in the Premises during the Term or any holding over results in contamination of the Premises, the Project or any adjacent property or if contamination of the Premises, the Project or any adjacent property by Hazardous Materials brought into, kept, used, stored, handled, treated, generated in, or released or disposed of from, the Premises by anyone other than Landlord and Landlord s employees, agents and contractors otherwise occurs during the Term or any holding over, Tenant hereby indemnifies and shall defend and hold Landlord, its officers, directors, employees, agents and contractors harmless from any and all actions (including, without limitation, remedial or enforcement actions of any kind, administrative or judicial proceedings, and orders or judgments arising out of or resulting therefrom), costs, claims, damages (including, without limitation, punitive damages and damages based upon diminution in value of the Premises or the Project, or the loss of, or restriction on, use of the Premises or any portion of the Project), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys , consultants  and experts  fees, court costs and amounts paid in settlement of any claims or actions), fines, forfeitures or other civil, administrative or criminal penalties, injunctive or other relief (whether or not based upon personal injury, property damage, or contamination of, or adverse effects upon, the environment, water tables or natural resources), liabilities or losses (collectively,    Environmental Claims   ) which arise during or after the Term as a result of such contamination.  This indemnification of Landlord by Tenant includes, without limitation, costs incurred in connection with any investigation of site conditions or any cleanup, treatment, remedial, removal, or restoration work required by any federal, state or local Governmental Authority because of Hazardous Materials present in the air, soil or ground water above, on, or under the Premises.  Without limiting the foregoing, if the presence of any Hazardous Materials on the Premises, the Building, the Project or any adjacent property caused or permitted by Tenant or any Tenant Party results in any contamination of the Premises, the Building, the Project or any adjacent property, Tenant shall promptly take all actions at its sole expense and in accordance with applicable Environmental Requirements as are necessary to return the Premises, the Building, the Project or any adjacent property to the condition existing prior to the time of such contamination, provided that Landlord s approval of such action shall first be obtained, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld so long as such actions would not potentially have any material adverse long-term or short-term effect on the Premises, the Building or the Project.  Tenant acknowledges having received a copy of Landlord s Phase I environmental site assessment report with respect to the Project.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in   Section 28   or this   Section 30  , Tenant shall not be responsible for, and the indemnification and hold harmless obligation set forth in this paragraph shall not apply to (i) contamination in the Premises which Tenant can reasonably establish existed in the Premises immediately prior to the Commencement Date, (ii) the presence of any Hazardous Materials in the Premises which Tenant can reasonably establish migrated from outside of the Premises into the Premises, or (iii) contamination caused by Landlord or any Landlord s employees, agents and contractors, unless in any case, the presence of such Hazardous Materials (x) is the result of a breach by Tenant of any of its obligations under this Lease, or (y) was caused, contributed to or exacerbated by Tenant or any Tenant Party.   
  (b)        Business  .  Landlord acknowledges that it is not the intent of this   Section 30   to prohibit Tenant from using the Premises for the Permitted Use.  Tenant may operate its business according to prudent industry practices so long as the use or presence of Hazardous Materials is strictly and properly monitored  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 29 

   according to all then applicable Environmental Requirements.  As a material inducement to Landlord to allow Tenant to use Hazardous Materials in connection with its business, Tenant agrees to deliver to Landlord prior to the Commencement Date a list identifying each type of Hazardous Materials to be brought upon, kept, used, stored, handled, treated, generated on, or released or disposed of from, the Premises and setting forth any and all governmental approvals or permits required in connection with the presence, use, storage, handling, treatment, generation, release or disposal of such Hazardous Materials on or from the Premises (   Hazardous Materials List   ).  Tenant shall maintain a current and up to date Hazardous Materials List at the Premises and with applicable Governmental Authorities. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an updated Hazardous Materials List at any time that Tenant is required to deliver a Hazardous Materials List to any Governmental Authority (e.g., the fire department) in connection with its use or occupancy of the Premises.  Tenant shall deliver to Landlord true and correct copies of the following documents (the    Haz Mat Documents   ) relating to the use, storage, handling, treatment, generation, release or disposal of Hazardous Materials prior to the Commencement Date, or if unavailable at that time, concurrent with the receipt from or submission to a Governmental Authority:  permits; approvals; reports and correspondence; storage and management plans, notice of violations of any Legal Requirements; plans relating to the installation of any storage tanks to be installed at the Project (provided, said installation of tanks shall only be permitted after Landlord has given Tenant its written consent to do so, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); all closure plans or any other documents required by any and all federal, state and local Governmental Authorities for any storage tanks installed in, on or under the Project for the closure of any such tanks; and a Surrender Plan (to the extent surrender in accordance with   Section 28   cannot be accomplished in 3 months).  Tenant is not required, however, to provide Landlord with any portion(s) of the Haz Mat Documents containing information of a proprietary nature which, in and of themselves, do not contain a reference to any Hazardous Materials or hazardous activities.  It is not the intent of this Section to provide Landlord with information which could be detrimental to Tenant s business should such information become possessed by Tenant s competitors. 
  (c)        Intentionally Omitted  .   
  (d)        Testing  .  Landlord shall have the right to conduct annual tests of the Premises to determine whether any contamination of the Premises or the Project has occurred as a result of Tenant s use.  Tenant shall be required to pay the cost of such annual test of the Premises if there is violation of this   Section 30  ; provided, however, that if Tenant conducts its own tests of the Premises using third party contractors and test procedures acceptable to Landlord which tests are certified to Landlord, Landlord shall accept such tests in lieu of the annual tests to be paid for by Tenant, if applicable.  In addition to the annual tests Landlord may conduct pursuant to this   Section 30(d)  , Landlord may conduct additional tests at the expiration or earlier termination of the Term to determine if contamination has occurred as a result of Tenant s use of the Premises.  In connection with such testing, upon the request of Landlord, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord or its consultant such non-proprietary information concerning the use of Hazardous Materials in or about the Premises by Tenant or any Tenant Party.  If contamination has occurred (not including Hazardous Materials residue that would typically be removed upon the decommissioning of the Premises) for which Tenant is liable under this   Section 30  , Tenant shall pay the costs to conduct such tests.  If no such contamination is found, Landlord shall pay the costs of such tests (which shall not constitute an Operating Expense).  Landlord shall provide Tenant with a copy of all third party, non-confidential reports and tests of the Premises made by or on behalf of Landlord during the Term without representation or warranty and subject to a confidentiality agreement.  Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly and satisfactorily remediate any contamination for which Tenant is liable under this   Section 30   identified by such testing in accordance with all Environmental Requirements.  Landlord s receipt of or satisfaction with any environmental assessment in no way waives any rights which Landlord may have against Tenant. 
  (e)        Control Areas  .  Tenant shall be entitled to use 100% of the Hazardous Materials inventory within any control area or zone located within the Building, as designated by the applicable building code, for chemical use or storage.  If Tenant does not lease all of the Spectrum 3 Building (as defined below), Tenant shall be allowed to utilize up to its pro rata share of the Hazardous Materials inventory within any control area or zone (located within Tenant s premises in the Spectrum 3 Building), as designated by the  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 30 

   applicable building code, for chemical use or storage.  As used in the preceding sentence, Tenant s pro rata share of any control areas or zones located within Tenant s premises in the Spectrum 3 Building  shall be determined based on the rentable square footage that Tenant leases within the applicable control area or zone.  For purposes of example only, if a control area or zone contains 10,000 rentable square feet and 2,000 rentable square feet of a tenant s premises are located within such control area or zone (while such premises as a whole contains 5,000 rentable square feet), the applicable tenant s pro rata share of such control area would be 20%.   
  (f)        Underground Tanks  .  In no event shall Tenant have the right to install or use any underground storage tanks storing Hazardous Materials at the Project.  The term  underground storage tank  as used in this Lease shall not include above-ground storage tanks located in the subterranean parking garage and/or the mechanical/service yard. 
  (g)        Tenant s Obligations  .  Each party s obligations under this   Section 30   shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease.  During any period of time after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease required by Tenant or Landlord to complete the removal from the Premises of any Hazardous Materials for which Tenant is responsible under this Lease (including, without limitation, the release and termination of any licenses or permits restricting the use of the Premises and the completion of the approved Surrender Plan), Tenant shall continue to pay the full Rent in accordance with this Lease for any portion of the Premises not relet by Landlord in Landlord s sole discretion, which Rent shall be prorated daily. 
  (h)        Definitions  .  As used herein, the term    Environmental Requirements    means all applicable present and future statutes, regulations, ordinances, rules, codes, judgments, orders or other similar enactments of any Governmental Authority regulating or relating to environmental conditions on, under, or about the Premises or the Project, or the environment, including without limitation, the following:  the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and all state and local counterparts thereto, and any regulations or policies promulgated or issued thereunder.  As used herein, the term    Hazardous Materials    means and includes any substance, material, waste, pollutant, or contaminant listed or defined as hazardous or toxic, or regulated by reason of its impact or potential impact on humans, animals and/or the environment under any Environmental Requirements, asbestos and petroleum, including crude oil or any fraction thereof, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas usable for fuel (or mixtures of natural gas and such synthetic gas).  As defined in Environmental Requirements, Tenant is and shall be deemed to be the    operator    of Tenant s    facility    and the    owner    of all Hazardous Materials brought on the Premises by Tenant or any Tenant Party, and the wastes, by-products, or residues generated, resulting, or produced therefrom. 
  31.        Tenant s Remedies/Limitation of Liability  .   
  (a)        Generally  .  Landlord shall not be in default hereunder unless Landlord fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder within 30 days after written notice from Tenant specifying such failure (unless such performance will, due to the nature of the obligation, require a period of time in excess of 30 days, then after such period of time as is reasonably necessary).  Upon any default by Landlord, Tenant shall give notice by registered or certified mail to any Holder of a Mortgage covering the Premises and to any landlord of any lease of property in or on which the Premises are located and Tenant shall offer such Holder and/or landlord a reasonable opportunity to cure the default, including time to obtain possession of the Project by power of sale or a judicial action if such should prove necessary to effect a cure;   provided   Landlord shall have furnished to Tenant in writing the names and addresses of all such persons who are to receive such notices.  All obligations of Landlord hereunder shall be construed as covenants, not conditions; and, except as may be otherwise expressly provided in this Lease, Tenant may not terminate this Lease for breach of Landlord s obligations hereunder. 
  All obligations of Landlord under this Lease will be binding upon Landlord only during the period of its ownership of the Premises and not thereafter.  The term    Landlord    in this Lease shall mean only the  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 31 

   owner for the time being of the Premises.  Upon the transfer by such owner of its interest in the Premises, such owner shall thereupon be released and discharged from all obligations of Landlord thereafter accruing, but such obligations shall be binding during the Term upon each new owner for the duration of such owner s ownership. 
  (b)        Tenant s Self-Help Remedy  .  If Landlord is in default of any of its obligations to maintain and repair the Premises (other than as a result of a casualty, which shall be governed solely by the provisions of   Section 18   of this Lease) (collectively referred to in this   Section 31(b)   as    repairs   ), then notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Tenant may, provided that it does not materially adversely affect any Building Systems affecting other tenants of the Project or materially adversely affect the Building structure  ,   perform such repairs subject to the following terms and conditions: 
  (i)        Tenant shall deliver written notice to Landlord and any Holder whose name and address has previously been furnished to Tenant in writing (the    Self-Help Notice   ) of Tenant s intention to perform such repairs, which Self-Help Notice shall state in bold-faced all capital letters:   FAILURE TO PERFORM SUCH WORK IN TEN (10) DAYS SHALL RESULT IN TENANT S EXERCISE OF SELF-HELP .  If neither Landlord nor lender commences to cure Landlord s failure to perform such repairs within 10 days after receipt of the Self-Help Notice, then Tenant may take such action as is reasonably necessary to perform such repairs;  
  (ii)        All repairs performed by Tenant or its agents pursuant to this   Section 31(b)   must be performed in a good and workmanlike manner in compliance with applicable Legal Requirements and, to the extent possible, using contractors then under contract to perform maintenance at the Project whose names have been provided to Tenant by Landlord or whose names are otherwise reasonably known to Tenant, and shall not void any warranties or guaranties on the Premises or the Project; 
  (iii)        In the event Landlord s failure relates to repairs that are bona fide emergency repairs (i.e., necessary to prevent or remediate a material and imminent threat to the health or safety of persons or necessary to prevent a material adverse affect on Tenant s business operations), then notwithstanding the provisions of   Section 31(b)(i)   above, the Self-Help Notice shall be in the form and shall be given in such amount of time as is reasonable in the circumstances, and if Landlord or lender fails to respond within a time as is reasonable in the circumstances, Tenant may cause such emergency repairs to be made pursuant to the requirements set forth herein; and 
  (iv)        Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for Tenant s reasonable out-of-pocket third party costs of the performance of the repairs that are incurred under the terms of this   Section 31(b)   (the    Reimbursement Amount   ) within 30 days after Tenant s submission to Landlord of Tenant s bill therefor, which bill shall be accompanied by receipted, itemized invoices (with reasonable supporting documentation) and conditional lien releases from all contractors, subcontractors, materialmen and suppliers that performed the work or provided the material or services reflected in the bill), provided, however, in no event shall such emergency repairs exceed what is required to end the pending emergency (it being understood and agreed by Landlord that in the case of an emergency, depending upon the circumstances, overtime and/or premium time labor charges may be reasonable).  Tenant shall provide unconditional lien waivers to Landlord in connection with all such bills paid within 10 days after Landlord s payment of Tenant s bill.  In the event Landlord fails to pay all or any portion of the Reimbursement Amount due Tenant under this   Section 31(b)   within 30 days after receipt of Tenant s bill therefore, together with the invoices therefor, supporting documentation and the conditional lien releases required by this   Section 31(b)(iv)  , along with written notice to Landlord stating in bold-faced, all capital letters that:   FAILURE TO REIMBURSE WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS SHALL RESULT IN TENANT S EXERCISE OF OFFSET RIGHTS , Tenant may offset such delinquent amount against up to 20% of the monthly Base Rent due from Tenant until Tenant has been reimbursed in full, provided that Tenant shall provide Landlord with unconditional lien waivers in connection with the work relating to such amounts within 10 days of the date on which the amount  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 32 

   has been fully paid or so offset, or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord delivers to Tenant a good faith written objection notice within 10 business days after receipt of Tenant s notice of intent to offset, setting forth with reasonable particularity Landlord s reasons for its claim that Landlord is not required to pay Tenant all or any specified portion of the Reimbursement Amount, then Tenant shall not be entitled to offset the disputed portion of the Reimbursement Amount.  If Landlord and Tenant are not able to reach agreement with respect to the disputed matters within 10 business days after Tenant s receipt of such notice from Landlord, the parties shall submit such dispute to arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association in San Diego in accordance with the  Expedited Procedures  of its Commercial Arbitration Rules.  Unless the parties otherwise agree, the arbitrator must be a retired judge of the Superior Court of the State of California. All costs associated with arbitration shall be awarded to the prevailing party as determined by the arbitrator.  Nothing contained in this   Section 31(b)   is intended to preclude or limit Landlord from passing through as part of Operating Expenses any Reimbursement Amount to the extent Landlord is otherwise not precluded under   Section 5   from passing through such cost as part of Operating Expenses. 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the self-help remedies provided for in this   Section 31   shall in no event apply to Landlord s Work and Tenant shall have no right to perform any portion of or complete the construction of Landlord s Work. 
  32.        Inspection and Access  .  Landlord and its agents, representatives, and contractors may enter the Premises at any reasonable time to inspect the Premises and to make such repairs as may be required or permitted pursuant to this Lease.  Landlord and Landlord s representatives may enter the Premises during business hours on not less than 2 business days advance written notice (except in the case of emergencies in which case Landlord shall provide such notice as is reasonable under the circumstances and such entry may be at any time) for the purpose of effecting any such repairs, inspecting the Premises, showing the Premises to prospective purchasers and, during the last year of the Term, to prospective tenants.  Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to coordinate with Tenant to schedule any such entry and activity in order to minimize interruption of Tenant s operations at the Premises.  Landlord may erect a suitable sign on the Building stating the Premises within the Building are available to let during the last year of the Term or that the Project is available for sale. Landlord shall not erect any signs on the Building in connection with the availability of space available to let in the Spectrum 3 Building. Landlord may grant easements, make public dedications, designate Common Areas and create restrictions on or about the Project outside the Building,   provided   that no such easement, dedication, designation or restriction materially adversely affects Tenant s use or occupancy of the Premises for the Permitted Use or materially adversely affects Tenant s rights with respect to the Exclusive Use Areas (other than on a temporary basis).  At Landlord s request, Tenant shall execute such instruments as may be necessary for such easements, dedications or restrictions.  Tenant shall at all times, except in the case of emergencies, have the right to escort Landlord or its agents, representatives, contractors or guests while the same are in the Premises, provided such escort does not materially and adversely affect Landlord s access rights hereunder. During Landlord s access of the Premises, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to comply with Tenant s reasonable security requirements; provided, however, that Tenant has notified Landlord of such security requirements prior to Landlord s entry into the Premises.  Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to comply with Tenant s written protocol with respect to entering restricted portions of the Premises; provided, however, that a copy of the same has previously been provided to Landlord.  Tenant shall have the right to designate (on plans provided by Tenant to Landlord, which may be reasonably updated by Tenant from time to time upon notice to Landlord) certain areas of the Premises as limited access areas required to protect the health of persons or security of confidential and proprietary information, which limited access areas shall not be entered into by Landlord or Landlord s representatives without a Tenant representative, except in the case of an emergency or as otherwise reasonably necessary. 
  Subject to the terms of this   Section 32  , Landlord may from time to time during the Term, during regular business hours and/or otherwise at times mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant, conduct third

  33.        Security  .  Landlord shall develop jointly with Tenant, subject to Tenant s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, a commercially reasonable security plan (the    Security Plan   ) for the exterior perimeter and Common Areas of the Project. Landlord shall provide (or cause to be provided) security to the Project in accordance with the Security Plan, the cost of which shall constitute an Operating Expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in   Section 5  , prior to the commencement of construction of the Spectrum 3 Building by Landlord, Tenant shall, as part of Operating Expenses, be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord with respect to the provision of security to the Project.  Notwithstanding the fact that Landlord provides (or causes to be provided) security services at the Project at any time during the Term, Landlord shall not be deemed to owe Tenant, or any person claiming by, through or under Tenant, any special duty or standard of care as a result of Landlord s provision of such security services and in no event shall Landlord be responsible for the efficacy of such security measures. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that security devices and services, if any, while intended to deter crime may not in given instances prevent theft or other criminal acts and that Landlord is not providing any security services with respect to the Premises.  Tenant agrees that Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for, and Tenant waives any claim against Landlord with respect to, any loss by theft or any other damage suffered or incurred by Tenant in connection with any unauthorized entry into the Premises or any other breach of security with respect to the Premises.  Tenant shall be solely responsible for the personal safety of Tenant s officers, employees, agents, contractors, guests and invitees while any such person is in, on or about the Premises and/or the Project.  Tenant shall at Tenant s cost obtain insurance coverage to the extent Tenant desires protection against such criminal acts. 
  Subject to the terms of this Lease, including, without limitation, Tenant s compliance with   Section 12  , Tenant, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, shall have the right to install and maintain a security and card access system including cameras inside and outside the Premises (including, as may be coordinated with Landlord as provided below, the Common Areas) (   Tenant s Security System   ), subject to the following conditions:  (i) Tenant s plans and specifications for the proposed location of Tenant s Security System and Tenant s protocol for the operation of Tenant s Security System shall be subject to Landlord s prior written approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that Tenant shall coordinate the installation and operation of Tenant s Security System with Landlord to assure that Tenant s Security System may be compatible with the Building s systems and equipment and Tenant does not violate the reasonable privacy rights of any other occupants of the Project; (ii) Landlord shall be provided with keys, codes and/or access cards, as applicable, and means of immediate access to fully exercise all of its entry rights under the Lease with respect to the Premises; and (iii) Tenant shall be solely responsible, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, for the monitoring, operation and removal of Tenant s Security System.  Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall remove Tenant s Security System. All costs and expenses associated with the removal of Tenant s Security System and the repair of any damage to the Premises and the Building resulting from the installation and/or removal of same shall be borne solely by Tenant.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Landlord shall not be directly or indirectly liable to Tenant, any Tenant Parties or any other person and Tenant hereby waives any and all claims against and releases Landlord from any and all claims arising as a consequence of or related to Tenant s Security System, or the failure thereof. 
  34.        Force Majeure  .  Except for the payment of Rent or as otherwise specifically excluded or limited in this Lease, neither Landlord nor Tenant shall be held     responsible or liable for delays in the performance of its obligations hereunder when caused by, related to, or arising out of acts of God, catastrophic weather, national, regional, or local disasters, calamities, or catastrophes, material delay in issuance or revocation of permits beyond the time periods customarily required by the City for such issuance or revocation, as applicable, enemy or hostile governmental action, terrorism, insurrection, riots, civil disturbance or commotion, fire or other casualty (   Force Majeure   ).

   party of the delay in question, specifying in such notice the nature of the delay and such party s good faith estimate of the length of the delay in question. 
  35.        Brokers  .  Landlord and Tenant each represents and warrants that it has not dealt with any broker, agent or other person (collectively,    Broker   ) in connection with this transaction and that no Broker brought about this transaction, other than DTZ.  Landlord and Tenant each hereby agree to indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any claims by any Broker, other than the broker, if any named in this   Section 35  , claiming a commission or other form of compensation by virtue of having dealt with Tenant or Landlord, as applicable, with regard to this leasing transaction. Landlord shall be responsible for all commissions due to DTZ arising out of the execution of this Lease in accordance with the terms of a separate written agreement between DTZ and Landlord. 
  36.        Limitation on Landlord s Liability  .  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN ANY OTHER AGREEMENT BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT TO THE CONTRARY:  (A) LANDLORD SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO TENANT OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (AND TENANT AND EACH SUCH OTHER PERSON ASSUME ALL RISK OF) LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY, WHETHER ACTUAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL TO:  TENANT S PERSONAL PROPERTY OF EVERY KIND AND DESCRIPTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION TRADE FIXTURES, EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS, LABORATORY ANIMALS, PRODUCT, SPECIMENS, SAMPLES, AND/OR SCIENTIFIC, BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER RECORDS OF EVERY KIND AND DESCRIPTION KEPT AT THE PREMISES AND ANY AND ALL INCOME DERIVED OR DERIVABLE THEREFROM; (B) THERE SHALL BE NO PERSONAL RECOURSE TO LANDLORD FOR ANY ACT OR OCCURRENCE IN, ON OR ABOUT THE PREMISES OR ARISING IN ANY WAY UNDER THIS LEASE OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND ANY LIABILITY OF LANDLORD HEREUNDER SHALL BE STRICTLY LIMITED SOLELY TO LANDLORD S INTEREST IN THE PROJECT OR ANY PROCEEDS FROM SALE OR CONDEMNATION THEREOF AND ANY INSURANCE PROCEEDS PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF LANDLORD S INTEREST IN THE PROJECT OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH LOSS; AND (C) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PERSONAL LIABILITY BE ASSERTED AGAINST LANDLORD IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LEASE NOR SHALL ANY RECOURSE BE HAD TO ANY OTHER PROPERTY OR ASSETS OF LANDLORD OR ANY OF LANDLORD S OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR CONTRACTORS.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL LANDLORD OR ANY OF LANDLORD S OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR CONTRACTORS BE LIABLE FOR INJURY TO TENANT S BUSINESS OR FOR ANY LOSS OF INCOME OR PROFIT THEREFROM. 
  37.        Severability  .  If any clause or provision of this Lease is illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws, then and in that event, it is the intention of the parties hereto that the remainder of this Lease shall not be affected thereby.  It is also the intention of the parties to this Lease that in lieu of each clause or provision of this Lease that is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, there be added, as a part of this Lease, a clause or provision as similar in effect to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable clause or provision as shall be legal, valid and enforceable. 
  38.        Signs; Exterior Appearance  .

Subject  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 35 

   to applicable Legal Requirements, the parties anticipate the Building Signs will total 100 square feet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant acknowledges and agrees that the Building Signs including, without limitation, the size, color and type, shall be subject to Landlord s prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, shall be consistent with Landlord s signage program at the Project and shall be subject to any and all other required approvals and applicable Legal Requirements.  Tenant shall be responsible, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, for the maintenance of the Building Signs, for the removal of the Building Signs at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease and for the repair of all damage resulting from such removal.  The Building Signs shall be personal to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, except that such right may be assigned in connection with any Permitted Assignment. 
  Tenant shall, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, have the non-exclusive right to install a sign bearing Tenant s name on the Monument Sign serving the Project (the    Monument Sign   ), as reflected on   Exhibit K   attached hereto.

The Monument Sign shall be personal to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, except that such right may be assigned in connection with any Permitted Assignment.  Tenant has elected option A reflected on   Exhibit K   with respect to the Monument Sign. 
  39.        Right to Expand  . 
  (a)        Expansion in the Project  .  Subject to Landlord s obtaining all required Approvals (subject to the third paragraph of   Section 2   above), Landlord shall, within 24 months after the Rent Commencement Date, construct a second building at the Project containing approximately 40,000-60,000 rentable square feet of rentable space (the    Spectrum 3 Building   ).  Landlord shall, in the exercise of its sole and absolute discretion, make the decisions as to all matters regarding the Spectrum 3 Building including, without limitation, the size thereof.  Tenant acknowledges that, if Landlord so elects in its sole and absolute discretion, all or a portion of the Spectrum 3 Building may consist of small suites (e.g., a science hotel).  So long as Tenant is then leasing not less than 75% of the Premises, then, subject to the terms of this   Section 39  , the first time that Landlord intends to accept a written proposal (the    Pending Deal   ) to lease all or a portion of the ROFR Space (as hereinafter defined) to a third party, Landlord shall deliver to Tenant written notice (the    Pending Deal Notice   ) of the existence and the material terms of such Pending Deal.  For purposes of this   Section 39(a)  ,    ROFR Space    shall mean any space in the Spectrum 3 Building.  Tenant shall be entitled to exercise its right under this   Section 39(a  ) only with respect to the entire ROFR Space described in such Pending Deal Notice (the    Identified Space   ).  Within 10 business days after Tenant s receipt of the Pending Deal Notice, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord written notice (the    Space Acceptance Notice   ) if Tenant elects to lease the Identified Space.  Tenant s right to receive the Pending Deal Notice and election to lease or not lease the Identified Space pursuant to this   Section 39(a)   is hereinafter referred to as the    Right of Refusal  .   If Tenant elects to lease the Identified Space by delivering the Space Acceptance Notice within the required 10 business day period, Tenant shall be deemed to agree to lease the Identified Space on the same general terms and conditions as this Lease except that the terms of the Lease shall be modified to reflect the terms of the Pending Deal Notice for the rental of the Identified Space, provided, however, that (i) if the term of the lease with respect to the Identified Space would pursuant to the Pending Deal expire prior to the term of the Lease with respect to the then-existing Premises, then the term of the Lease with respect to the Identified Space shall be modified to be co-terminous with the Term of this Lease with respect to the then-existing Premises, and (ii) if the term of the lease with respect to the Identified Space is modified to be co-terminous with the term of the then-existing Premises pursuant to sub-section (i), then the economic terms set forth in the Pending Deal Notice shall be equitably adjusted to account for such extension of the term with respect to the Identified Space, provided that such adjustment of the economic terms shall be no less favorable to Landlord  on an annual basis than the economic terms set forth in the Pending Deal (and with market rate  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 36 

   annual increases in base rent for the Identified Space for that portion of the lease term for the Identified Space beyond the term provided for in the Pending Deal), as reasonably determined by Landlord and Tenant.  If the term of the lease with respect to the Identified Space would pursuant to the Pending Deal expire after the term of this Lease with respect to the then-existing Premises, then the term of the lease with respect to the Identified Space shall be as provided in the Pending Deal (and, for the avoidance of any doubt, no adjustment shall be made to the term of this Lease for the then-existing Premises).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the Work Letter or the TI Allowance (as defined in the Work Letter) apply to the Identified Space, as the terms and conditions of the Pending Deal Notice (as may be equitably adjusted by Landlord), including any tenant improvement allowance provided for in the Pending Deal Notice, shall apply.  If Tenant fails to deliver a Space Acceptance Notice to Landlord within the required 10 business day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this   Section 39(a)   to lease the Identified Space identified in the applicable Pending Deal Notice, and Landlord shall have the right to lease such Identified Space to the third party subject to the Pending Deal (or an affiliate of such third party) (   Pending Deal Party   ).  Tenant s Right of First Refusal with respect to such Identified Space shall be restored if Landlord fails to enter into an agreement to lease the Identified Space to the Pending Deal Party within 6 months after Landlord s deliver of the Pending Deal Notice to Tenant.  Tenant s Right of First Refusal shall exist with respect to each portion of the Spectrum 3 Building until such portion of the Spectrum 3 Building has been subject to a Pending Deal.  For the avoidance of any doubt, Tenant shall in no event be entitled to a second Pending Deal Notice with respect to any space in the Spectrum 3 Building once Landlord has entered into a lease with a Pending Deal Party with respect to such space in the Spectrum 3 Building. 
  If Tenant leases a portion of the Spectrum 3 Building and a portion of the Spectrum 3 Building is leased to a third party, the following Lease provisions shall also apply to Tenant s leasing of the Identified  Space (and in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this paragraph and the other provisions of the this Lease with respect to the leasing of the Identified Space, the provisions of this paragraph shall govern): (i) Tenant shall not, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, use the Identified Space in any manner which will require ventilation, air exchange, heating, gas, steam, electricity or water beyond the existing capacity of the Spectrum 3 Building as proportionately allocated to the Identified Space based upon Tenant s share of the Spectrum 3 Building as usually furnished for the Permitted Use, (ii) Tenant s Alterations affecting the structure of the Spectrum 3 Building or the Building Systems serving the Spectrum 3 Building shall require Landlord s consent which consent may be given or withheld in Landlord s sole discretion, (iii) Landlord may equitably increase, in Landlord s reasonable discretion, Tenant s share of Operating Expenses for any item of expense or cost reimbursable by Tenant that relates to a repair, replacement, or service that benefits only the Identified Space or only a portion of the Spectrum 3 Building that includes the Identified Space or that varies with occupancy or use.  Also, so long as Tenant leases any portion of the Spectrum 3 Building,   Section 5(hh)   shall be deleted in its entirety. 
  (b)        Amended Lease  .      If: (i) Tenant fails to timely deliver a Space Acceptance Notice, or (ii) after the expiration of a period of 20 days from the date Landlord delivers to Tenant a lease amendment or lease agreement for the Identified Space no lease amendment or lease agreement for the Identified Space acceptable to both parties each in their reasonable discretion has been executed and delivered by Tenant to Landlord, Tenant shall be deemed to have waived its right to lease the Identified Space subject to the applicable Pending Deal, subject to terms of   Section 39(a)  . 
  (c)        Exceptions  .  Notwithstanding the above, the Right of First Refusal shall, at Landlord s option, not be in effect and may not be exercised by Tenant: 
  (i)        during any period of time that Tenant is in Default under any provision of the Lease; or 
  (ii)        if Tenant has been in Default under any provision of the Lease 3 or more times, whether or not the Defaults are cured, during the 12 month period prior to the date on which Tenant seeks to exercise the Right of First Refusal. 

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 37 

   (d)        Termination  .  The Right of First Refusal shall, at Landlord s option, terminate and be of no further force or effect even after Tenant s due and timely exercise of the Right of First Refusal, if, after such exercise, but prior to the commencement date of the lease of such Right of First Refusal, (i) Tenant fails to timely cure any default by Tenant under the Lease; or (ii) Tenant has Defaulted 3 or more times during the period from the date of the exercise of the Right of First Refusal to the date of the commencement of the lease of the Identified Space, whether or not such Defaults are cured. 
  (e)        Subordinate  .  Tenant hereby acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Tenant s Right of First Refusal shall be subject and subordinate to any expansion rights granted in the Spectrum 3 Building to any Pending Deal Party with whom Landlord enters into a lease for space in the Spectrum 3 Building. 
  (f)        Rights Personal  .  The Right of First Refusal is personal to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and is not assignable without Landlord s consent, which may be granted or withheld in Landlord s sole discretion separate and apart from any consent by Landlord to an assignment of Tenant s interest in the Lease, except that it may be assigned in connection with any Permitted Assignment of this Lease. 
  (g)        No Extensions  .  The period of time within which the Right of First Refusal may be exercised shall not be extended or enlarged by reason of Tenant s inability to exercise the Right of First Refusal. 
  40.        Right to Extend Term  .  Tenant shall have the right to extend the Term of the Lease upon the following terms and conditions: 
  (a)        Extension Rights  .  Tenant shall have 2 consecutive rights (each, an    Extension Right   ) to extend the term of this Lease for 5 years each (each, an    Extension Term   ) on the same terms and conditions as this Lease (other than with respect to Base Rent     and the Work Letter) by giving Landlord written notice of its election to exercise each Extension Right at least 12 months prior to the expiration of the Base Term of the Lease or the expiration of the prior Extension Term. 
         Upon the commencement of any Extension Term, Base Rent shall be payable at the Market Rate (as defined below).  As used herein,    Market Rate    shall mean the rate (including, if applicable, periodic (but no more frequently than annual) increases) that comparable landlords of comparable buildings have accepted in current transactions from non-equity (i.e., not being offered equity in the buildings) and nonaffiliated tenants of similar financial strength for space of comparable size, quality (including all Tenant s Work, Alterations and other improvements) and floor height in Class A laboratory/office buildings in the Torrey Pines area of San Diego for a comparable term, with the determination of the Market Rate to take into account all relevant factors, including tenant inducements, views, signage rights, covered parking, available amenities other than the Amenities, age of the Building, age of mechanical systems serving the Premises, leasing commissions, allowances or concessions, if any.  In addition, there may be a market rent for the parking rights provided hereunder if tenants of comparable buildings in the Torrey Pines area of San Diego are then customarily paying fees for parking rights granted under their leases and provided further that in the event that there is a market rent for parking rights, Base Rent shall exclude any consideration as to parking rights.  Also, on the first day of each month during each Extension Term, Tenant shall also be required to pay an amenities fee in connection with the Amenities (the    Amenities Fee   ).  The Amenities Fee payable on the commencement date of the first year of the Extension Term shall be an amount calculated as follows:  $0.18 per rentable square foot of the Premises per month escalated on each date that Base Rent is adjusted pursuant to the schedule set forth on page 1 of this Lease and on the commencement date of the Extension Term by multiplying the amount payable immediately before such adjustment date and commencement date, as applicable, by 2.9% (for example, on the first day of the 61   st    month of the Base Term, the $0.18 per rentable square foot of the Premises per month would be escalated by 2.9% to $0.18522 per rentable square foot of the Premises per month and on the first day of the 73   rd    month of the Base Term, the $0.18522 per rentable square foot of the Premises per month would be escalated to $0.19 per rentable square foot of the Premises per month, and so on).  The Amenities Fee shall continue to increase through the first Extension Term by 2.9% on each annual anniversary of the commencement date of the first Extension Term and, if  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 38 

   Tenant elects to exercise its second Extension Term, the Amenities Fee shall increase on the commencement date of the second Extension Term and on each annual anniversary of the commencement date of the second Extension Term by 2.9%. 
  If, on or before the date which is 270 days prior to the expiration of the Base Term of this Lease or the expiration of the prior Extension Term (as applicable), Tenant has not agreed with Landlord s determination of the Market Rate and the rent escalations during the applicable Extension Term after negotiating in good faith, Tenant shall be deemed to have elected arbitration as described in   Section 40(b)  .  If Tenant has elected to exercise an Extension Right by delivering notice to Landlord as required in this   Section 40(a)  , Tenant and, except as otherwise provided in   Section 40(d)   and   Section 40(f)   below, Landlord, shall have no right thereafter to rescind or elect not to extend the term of the Lease for such Extension Term.   
  (b)        Arbitration  .   
  (iii)        Within 10 days of Tenant s notice to Landlord of its election (or deemed election) to arbitrate Market Rate and escalations, each party shall deliver to the other a proposal containing the Market Rate and escalations that the submitting party believes to be correct (   Extension Proposal   ).  If either party fails to timely submit an Extension Proposal, the other party may send a notice to such party indicating the failure and stating that if an Extension Proposal is not sent within 10 days after such second notice, the party s submitted proposal shall determine the Base Rent and escalations for the Extension Term.  If either party fails to timely submit an Extension Proposal following such second notice, the party s submitted proposal shall determine the Base Rent and escalations for the Extension Term.  If both parties submit Extension Proposals, then Landlord and Tenant shall meet within 7 days after delivery of the last Extension Proposal and make a good faith attempt to mutually appoint a single Arbitrator (and defined below) to determine the Market Rate and escalations.  If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon a single Arbitrator, then each shall, by written notice delivered to the other within 10 days after the meeting, select an Arbitrator.  If either party fails to timely give notice of its selection for an Arbitrator, the other party s submitted proposal shall determine the Base Rent for the Extension Term.  The 2 Arbitrators so appointed shall, within 5 business days after their appointment, appoint a third Arbitrator.  If the 2 Arbitrators so selected cannot agree on the selection of the third Arbitrator within the time above specified, then either party, on behalf of both parties, may request such appointment of such third Arbitrator by application to any state court of general jurisdiction in the jurisdiction in which the Premises are located (or, if the state court does not agree to make such appointment, such appointment of such third Arbitrator shall be made by the President of the Greater San Diego Association of Realtors (or, if such President has previously worked for either party, the most immediate past President of the San Diego Association of Realtors not having such a conflict)), upon 10 days prior written notice to the other party of such intent. 
  (iv)        The decision of the Arbitrator(s) shall be made within 30 days after the appointment of a single Arbitrator or the third Arbitrator, as applicable.  The decision of the single Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties.  The average of the two closest Arbitrators in a three Arbitrator panel shall be final and binding upon the parties.  Each party shall pay the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator appointed by or on behalf of such party and the fees and expenses of the third Arbitrator shall be borne equally by both parties.  If the Market Rate and escalations are not determined by the first day of the Extension Term, then Tenant shall pay Landlord Base Rent in an amount equal to the Base Rent in effect immediately prior to the Extension Term and increased by the Rent Adjustment Percentage until such determination is made.  After the determination of the Market Rate and escalations, the parties shall make any necessary adjustments to such payments made by Tenant.  Landlord and Tenant shall then execute an amendment recognizing the Market Rate and escalations for the Extension Term. 
  (v)        An    Arbitrator    shall be any person appointed by or on behalf of either party or appointed pursuant to the provisions hereof and:  (i) shall be (A) a member of the American Institute  

Exhibit 10.10

  (c)        Rights Personal  .  Extension Rights are personal to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and are not assignable without Landlord s consent, which may be granted or withheld in Landlord s sole discretion separate and apart from any consent by Landlord to an assignment of Tenant s interest in the Lease, except that they may be assigned in connection with any Permitted Assignment of this Lease. 
  (d)        Exceptions  .  Notwithstanding anything set forth above to the contrary, Extension Rights shall, at Landlord s option, not be in effect and Tenant may not exercise any of the Extension Rights: 
  (i)        during any period of time that Tenant is in Default under any provision of this Lease; or 
  (ii)        if Tenant has been in Default under any provision of this Lease 3 or more times, whether or not the Defaults are cured, during the 12 month period immediately prior to the date that Tenant intends to exercise an Extension Right, whether or not the Defaults are cured. 
  (e)        No Extensions  .  The period of time within which any Extension Rights may be exercised shall not be extended or enlarged by reason of Tenant s inability to exercise the Extension Rights. 
  (f)        Termination  .  The Extension Rights shall, at Landlord s option, terminate and be of no further force or effect even after Tenant s due and timely exercise of an Extension Right, if, after such exercise, but prior to the commencement date of an Extension Term, (i) Tenant fails to timely cure any default by Tenant under this Lease; or (ii) Tenant has Defaulted 3 or more times during the period from the date of the exercise of an Extension Right to the date of the commencement of the Extension Term, whether or not such Defaults are cured.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Tenant acknowledges and agrees that ATP Landlord shall have the right, at the sole discretion of ATP Landlord, to discontinue the availability of The Alexandria at any time; provided, however, in no event shall ATP Landlord discontinue Tenant s rights to use the Amenities while continuing the rights of other tenants of the Project or the rights of tenants of affiliates of Landlord, ATP Landlord and ARE (or their respective successors or assigns) to use the Amenities. ATP Landlord shall have the sole right to determine all matters related to the Amenities including, without limitation, relating to the reconfiguration, relocation, modification or removal of any of the Amenities at The Alexandria and/or to revise, expand or discontinue any of the services (if any) provided in connection with the Amenities.

   (b)        License  .  Commencing on the mutual execution and delivery of this Lease by the parties, and so long as (i) The Alexandria and the Project continue to be owned by affiliates of ARE, (ii) The Alexandria continues to be operated as an amenities center, and (iii) ATP Landlord continues to make the Amenities available for use by Tenant, Tenant shall have the non-exclusive right to the use of the available Amenities in common with other Users pursuant to the terms of this   Section 41  . A total of 388 passes to the fitness center shall be issued to Tenant for its employees (but, following the Rent Commencement Date, the persons using such passes must be employed at the Premises).  Neither Tenant nor its employees shall have any right to access and/or use the Amenities unless Tenant and its employees have entered into license and use agreements (including indemnification and waiver agreements required by ATP Landlord) with respect to such Amenities which are in form and content reasonably acceptable to Landlord and/or ATP Landlord (the    Standard Use Agreements   ).  If, during the Base Term, the Amenities in their entirety become materially unavailable for use by Tenant (for any reason other than a Default by Tenant under this Lease or the default by Tenant of any Standard Use Agreements or other agreement(s) relating to the use of the Amenities by Tenant) for a period in excess of 15 consecutive days, then, commencing on the date that the Amenities in their entirety become materially unavailable for use by Tenant and continuing for the period that the Amenities in their entirety remain materially unavailable for use by Tenant, the Base Rent due under this Lease shall be reduced by an amount equal to $0.18 per rentable square foot of the Premises per month escalated on each date that Base Rent is adjusted pursuant to the schedule set forth on page 1 of this by multiplying the amount payable immediately before such adjustment date by 2.9% (for example, on the first day of the 61   st    month of the Base Term, the $0.18 per rentable square foot of the Premises per month would be escalated by 2.9% to $0.18522 per rentable square foot of the Premises per month and on the first day of the 73   rd    month of the Base Term, the $0.18522 per rentable square foot of the Premises per month to $0.19 per rentable square foot of the Premises, and so on). 
  (c)        Shared Conference Facilities  .  Use by Tenant of the Shared Conference Facilities and restaurant at The Alexandria shall be in common with other Users with scheduling procedures reasonably determined by ATP Landlord.  ATP Landlord reserves the right to exercise its reasonable discretion in the event of conflicting scheduling requests among Users.  Tenant hereby acknowledges that (i) Biocom/San Diego, a California non-profit corporation (   Biocom   ) has the right to reserve the Shared Conference Facilities and any reservable dining area(s) included as part of the Amenities at The Alexandria for up to 50% of the time that such Shared Conference Facilities and reservable dining area(s) are available for use by Users each calendar month, and (ii) Illumina, Inc., a Delaware corporation, has the exclusive use of the main conference room within the Shared Conference Facilities for up to 4 days per calendar month. 
  Any vendors engaged by Tenant in connection with Tenant s use of the Shared Conference Facilities shall be professional vendors holding any required licenses.  ATP Landlord shall have the right to reasonably approve any vendors utilized by Tenant in connection with Tenant s use of the Shared Conference Facilities.  Prior to any entry by any such vendor onto The Alexandria, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a copy of the contract between Tenant and such vendor and certificates of insurance from such vendor evidencing industry standard commercial general liability, automotive liability, and workers  compensation insurance.  Tenant shall cause all such vendors utilized by Tenant to provide a certificate of insurance naming Landlord, ARE, and ATP Landlord as additional insureds under the vendor s liability policies.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall be required to use the food service operator used by ATP Landlord at The Alexandria for any food service or catered events held by Tenant in the Shared Conference Facilities. 
  Tenant shall, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, (i) be responsible for the set-up of the Shared Conference Facilities in connection with Tenant s use (including, without limitation ensuring that Tenant has a sufficient number of chairs and tables and the appropriate equipment), and (ii) surrender the Shared Conference Facilities after each time that Tenant uses the Shared Conference Facilities free of Tenant s personal property, in substantially the same set up and same condition as received, subject to casualty, and free of any debris and trash.  If Tenant fails to restore and surrender the Shared Conference Facilities as required by sub-section (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, such failure shall constitute a    Shared Facilities Failure  .   Each time that Landlord or ATP Landlord reasonably determines that Tenant has committed a Shared Facilities Failure, Tenant shall be required to pay Landlord a penalty within 5 days after  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 41 

   notice from Landlord of such Shared Facilities Failure.  The penalty payable by Tenant in connection with the first Shared Facilities Failure shall be $200.  The penalty payable shall increase by $50 for each subsequent Shared Facilities Failure (for the avoidance of doubt, the penalty shall be $250 for the second Shared Facilities Failure, shall be $300 for the third Shared Facilities Failure, etc.).  In addition to the foregoing, Tenant shall be responsible for reimbursing ATP Landlord or Landlord, as applicable, for all costs expended by ATP Landlord or Landlord, as applicable, in repairing any damage to the Shared Conference Facilities, the Amenities, or The Alexandria caused by Tenant or any Tenant Related Party.  The provisions of this   Section 41(c)   shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 
  (d)        Rules and Regulations  .  Tenant shall be solely responsible for paying for any and all ancillary services (e.g., audio visual equipment) provided to Tenant, all food services operators  and any other third party vendors providing services to Tenant at The Alexandria.  Tenant shall use the Amenities (including, without limitation, the Shared Conference Facilities) in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements and any reasonable rules and regulations imposed by ATP Landlord or Landlord from time to time (which rules shall not be enforced in a discriminatory manner) and in a manner that will not interfere with the rights of other Users.  The use of Amenities other than the Shared Conference Facilities by employees of Tenant shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the License Agreements.  Neither ATP Landlord nor Landlord (nor, if applicable, any other affiliate of Landlord) shall have any liability or obligation for the breach of any rules or regulations by other Users with respect to the Amenities.  Tenant shall not make any alterations, additions, or improvements of any kind to the Shared Conference Facilities, the Amenities or The Alexandria. 
  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that ATP Landlord shall have the right at any time and from time to time to reconfigure, relocate, modify or remove any of the Amenities at The Alexandria and/or to revise, expand or discontinue any of the services (if any) provided in connection with the Amenities. 
  (e)        Waiver of Liability and Indemnification  .  Tenant warrants that it will use reasonable care to prevent damage to property and injury to persons while on The Alexandria.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, Tenant waives any claims it or any Tenant Parties may have against any ARE Parties relating to, arising out of or in connection with the Amenities and any entry by Tenant and/or any Tenant Parties onto The Alexandria, except to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any ARE Party, and Tenant releases and exculpates all ARE Parties from any liability relating to, arising out of or in connection with the Amenities and any entry by Tenant and/or any Tenant Parties onto The Alexandria.  Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the ARE Parties from any claim of damage to property or injury to person relating to, arising out of or in connection with (i) the use of the Amenities by Tenant or any Tenant Parties, and (ii) any entry by Tenant and/or any Tenant Parties onto The Alexandria, except to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or negligence of any ARE Party.  The provisions of this   Section 41   shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 
  (f)        Insurance  .  As of the mutual execution and delivery of this Lease by the parties, Tenant shall cause ATP Landlord to be named as an additional insured under the commercial general liability policy of insurance that Tenant is required to maintain pursuant to   Section 17   of this Lease. 
  42.        Roof Equipment  .  As long as Tenant is not in Default under this Lease, Tenant shall have the right at its sole cost and expense, subject to compliance with all Legal Requirements (including, without limitation, any height limitations imposed by the City of San Diego with Tenant acknowledging and agreeing that the planned height of the Building may result in Tenant not having any rights under this   Section 42  ), to install, maintain, and remove on the top of the roof of the Building one or more satellite dishes, communication antennae and other equipment for the transmission or reception of communication of signals, mechanical equipment, heat exchangers or other similar equipment (all of which having a diameter and height reasonably acceptable to Landlord) as Tenant may from time to time desire (collectively,    Roof Equipment   ) on the following terms and conditions: 

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 42 

   (a)        Requirements  .  Tenant shall submit to Landlord (i) the plans and specifications for the installation of the Roof Equipment, (ii) copies of all required governmental and quasi-governmental permits, licenses, and authorizations that Tenant will and must obtain at its own expense, with the cooperation of Landlord, if necessary for the installation and operation of the Roof Equipment, and (iii) an insurance policy or certificate of insurance evidencing insurance coverage as required by this Lease and any other insurance as reasonably required by Landlord for the installation and operation of the Roof Equipment.  Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its approval for the installation and operation of the Roof Equipment;   provided  ,   however  , that Landlord may reasonably withhold its approval if the installation or operation of the Roof Equipment (A) may damage the structural integrity of the Building, (B) may void, terminate, or invalidate any applicable roof warranty, (C) may reduce the leasable space in the Building, or (D) is not properly screened from the viewing public to Landlord s reasonable satisfaction.   
  (b)        No Damage to Roof  .  If installation of the Roof Equipment     requires Tenant to make any roof cuts or perform any other roofing work, such cuts shall only be made to the roof area of the Building located directly above the Premises and only in the manner designated in writing by Landlord; and any such installation work (including any roof cuts or other roofing work) shall be performed by Tenant, at Tenant s sole cost and expense by a roofing contractor designated by Landlord or otherwise reasonably approved by Landlord.  If Tenant or its agents shall otherwise cause any damage to the roof during the installation, operation, and removal of the Roof Equipment such damage shall be repaired promptly at Tenant s expense and the roof shall be restored in the same condition it was in before the damage, ordinary wear and tear excepted.  Landlord shall not charge Tenant Additional Rent for the installation and use of the Roof Equipment.  If, however, Landlord s insurance premium or Tax assessment increases as a result of the Roof Equipment, Tenant shall pay such increase as Additional Rent within thirty (30) days after receipt of a reasonably detailed invoice from Landlord.  Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement or reduction in the amount of Rent payable under this Lease if for any reason Tenant is unable to use the Roof Equipment.  In no event whatsoever shall the installation, operation, maintenance, or removal of the Roof Equipment by Tenant or its agents void, terminate, or invalidate any applicable roof warranty. 
  (c)        Protection  .  The installation, operation, and removal of the Roof Equipment shall be at Tenant s sole risk.  Tenant shall indemnify, defend, and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys  fees) of every kind and description that may arise out of or be connected in any way with Tenant s installation, operation, or removal of the Roof Equipment. 
  (d)        Removal  .  At the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or the discontinuance of the use of the Roof Equipment by Tenant, Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove the Roof Equipment from the Building.  Tenant shall leave the portion of the roof where the Roof Equipment was located in good order and repair, reasonable wear and tear excepted.  If Tenant does not so remove the Roof Equipment, Tenant hereby authorizes Landlord to remove and dispose of the Roof Equipment and charge Tenant as Additional Rent for all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in such removal and disposal.  Tenant agrees that Landlord shall not be liable for any Roof Equipment or related property disposed of or removed by Landlord. 
  (e)        No Interference  .  The Roof Equipment shall not interfere with the proper functioning of any telecommunications equipment or devices that have been installed prior to the installation of the Roof Equipment. 
  (f)        Relocation  .  Landlord shall have the right, at its expense (but not as an Operating Expense) and after 60 days prior notice to Tenant, to relocate the Roof Equipment to another site on the roof of the Building as long as such site reasonably meets Tenant s sight line and interference requirements and does not unreasonably interfere with Tenant s use and operation of the Roof Equipment. 
  (g)        Access  .  Landlord grants to Tenant the right of ingress and egress on a 24 hour 7 day per week basis to install, operate, and maintain the Roof Equipment.  Before receiving access to the roof of the  

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 43 

   Building, Tenant shall give Landlord at least 24 hours  advance written or oral notice, except (i) in emergency situations, in which case reasonable advance oral notice shall be given by Tenant and (ii) access for standard, periodic maintenance, in which case a one-time notice to Landlord of the nature of the maintenance and the general frequency of the access shall be adequate.  Landlord shall supply Tenant with the name, telephone, and pager numbers of the contact individual(s) responsible for providing access during emergencies. 
  (h)        Appearance  .  If permissible by Legal Requirements and reasonably practicable, the Roof Equipment shall be painted the same color as the exterior structural painted elements of the Building. 
  (i)        Intentionally Omitted  .   
  (j)        No Assurance of Roof Equipment  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Tenant acknowledges and agrees that (i) Landlord shall have no obligation to alter any plans Landlord may have, now or in the future, for the height of the Building so that Tenant may exercise or use any of its rights under this   Section 42   and (ii) Landlord may use the full height allocated to the Project so that Tenant will not have the right to exercise or use any of its rights under this     Section 42   in which case Tenant shall have no further rights under this   Section 42  .  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to pursue, so long as Landlord s development, use or operation of the Building is not materially adversely affected and the Building structure and Building Systems are not materially adversely affected, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, approvals and/or permits required from the applicable Governmental Entities for the installation and maintenance by Tenant of Roof Equipment which would exceed any height requirements imposed by applicable Governmental Entities, and if Tenant obtains such approvals and/or permits, Tenant shall have the right to install and maintain such Roof Equipment which would exceed such height requirements subject to the terms of this   Section 42  .  Landlord shall reasonably cooperate, at no cost to Landlord, in Tenant s efforts to obtain approvals and/or permits 
  43.        Emergency Generator  .  Subject to Tenant complying with all of the provisions of this Lease including, without limitation,   Section 12   hereof, and all applicable Legal Requirements and Landlord s rules and regulations, Tenant shall have the right, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, to install an emergency generator and related tanks and equipment (collectively,    Emergency Generator   ) in a location at the Project reasonably acceptable to both Landlord and Tenant (   Generator Area   ).  All such improvements to the Generator Area shall be of a design and type and with screening acceptable to Landlord, in Landlord s reasonable discretion.  Landlord shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to require Tenant to remove any such Emergency Generator installed by Tenant and restore the Generator Area to its original use and condition, free of any debris and trash and free of any Hazardous Materials, upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term.  Landlord shall have no obligation to make any repairs or improvements to the Emergency Generator or the Generator Area and Tenant shall maintain the same, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, in good repair and condition during the Term as though the same were part of the Premises.   
  44.        LEED Certification  .  Tenant agrees to reasonably cooperate with Landlord and to use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with measures reasonably implemented by Landlord with respect to the Building and/or the Project in connection with Landlord s efforts, if any, to obtain a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certificate for Landlord s Work.  Tenant shall have the right, at its sole discretion and at Tenant s sole cost and expense, to pursue LEED certification for the Tenant s Work. 
  45.        Learning Lab  .   
  (a)        General  .

   required in connection with such  operation of the Learning Lab.  The Rentable Area of Premises set forth on page 1 of this Lease includes all of the rentable area of the Premises, including any space that may be included in the Learning Lab.  Tenant shall not be required to pay Base Rent with respect to the Learning Lab but shall, commencing on the Rent Commencement Date, pay Operating Expenses with respect to the Learning Lab throughout the Term subject to and in accordance with the terms of   Section 5   of this Lease (meaning that the rentable square footage of the Learning Lab (not to exceed 1,500 rsf) shall be deducted from the Rentable Area of Premises as defined on page 1 of this Lease for the purpose of determining Base Rent, but Tenant s Share of Operating Expenses of Building shall not be reduced); provided, however, that if at any time during the Term Tenant ceases operating the Learning Lab as a center for science education as provided in this paragraph or otherwise commences using the Learning Lab in connection with its business operations, Tenant shall be required to pay Base Rent with respect to the Learning Lab at the same rate per rentable square foot as Tenant is then paying with respect to the balance of the Premises.  At any time during the Term, Tenant shall have the right to elect by written notice to Landlord to terminate the agreement with Landlord regarding the Learning Lab set forth in this   Section 45  , in which event (i) Tenant shall immediately commence paying Base Rent with respect to the Learning Lab at the same rate per rentable square foot as Tenant is then paying with respect to the balance of the Premises, (ii) this   Section 45   shall terminate and have no further force or effect, and (iii) Tenant shall continue to have the right as a Permitted Use hereunder, in Tenant s sole discretion, to use all or any portion of the Premises as a center for science education providing programs and services for children from and around the San Diego area, but without the obligations of   Sections 45(b)   and (  c  ). 
  (b)        Signage  .  Landlord and Tenant shall develop a mutually acceptable logo that represents the involvement of both Landlord (or, if designated by Landlord, an affiliate of Landlord) and Tenant with the Learning Lab, which logo shall, during any period that Tenant operates the Learning Lab as an educational facility pursuant to   Section 45(a)   above, be included on signage at the entry of the Learning Lab and at other locations within the Learning Lab reasonably acceptable to Landlord and Tenant.  Tenant shall not use the logo other than as expressly provided in this   Section 45(b)   and, if requested to do so by Landlord, Tenant shall promptly remove any reference to Landlord (or Landlord s affiliate, if applicable) from the logo. 
  (c)        Calendar of Events  .  Tenant shall provide Landlord with reasonable advance notice of all events being held at the Learning Lab while the Learning Lab operates as an educational facility pursuant to   Section 45(a)   above so that Landlord may, if it so elects and without any obligation to do so, attend any such events. 
  46.        Miscellaneous  . 
  (a)        Notices  .  All notices or other communications between the parties shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given upon delivery or refusal to accept delivery by the addressee thereof if delivered in person, or upon actual receipt if delivered by reputable overnight guaranty courier, addressed and sent to the parties at their addresses set forth above.  Landlord and Tenant may from time to time by written notice to the other designate another address for receipt of future notices. 
  (b)        Joint and Several Liability  .  If and when included within the term    Tenant  ,  as used in this instrument, there is more than one person or entity, each shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of Tenant. 
  (c)        Financial Information  .   Tenant shall furnish Landlord  with true and complete copies of (i) Tenant s most recent audited annual financial statements within 180 days of the end of each of Tenant s fiscal years during the Term, and (ii) Tenant s most recent unaudited quarterly financial statements within 90 days of the end of each of Tenant s first three fiscal quarters of each of Tenant s fiscal years during the Term. So long as Tenant or Tenant s parent entity (to the extent that the Tenant s financial statements are consolidated with those of its parent entity and separate financial statements are not maintained with respect to Tenant) is a  public company  and its financial information is publicly available, then the foregoing delivery requirements of this   Section 44(c)   shall not apply. 

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 45 

   (d)        Recordation  .  Neither this Lease nor a memorandum of lease shall be filed by or on behalf of Tenant in any public record.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon Tenant s request and at Tenant s sole cost and expense, Landlord shall execute and properly notarize a memorandum of lease prepared by Tenant which memorandum shall contain only the following information and any other additional information that may be required by applicable law: (i) the names of the parties to this Lease, (ii) description of the Premises and the Project, and (iii) the Term.  Tenant shall file such memorandum of lease, at Tenant s sole cost.  If Tenant fails, after written request from Landlord, to record a termination of the memorandum on the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall be responsible for any damages suffered by Landlord (from any cause including, without limitation, resulting from any indemnities or certifications which may be made by Landlord in favor of third parties).  The provisions of this   Section 46(d)   shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.   
  (e)        Interpretation  .  The normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Lease or any exhibits or amendments hereto.  Words of any gender used in this Lease shall be held and construed to include any other gender, and words in the singular number shall be held to include the plural, unless the context otherwise requires.  The captions inserted in this Lease are for convenience only and in no way define, limit or otherwise describe the scope or intent of this Lease, or any provision hereof, or in any way affect the interpretation of this Lease. 
  (f)        Not Binding Until Executed  .  The submission by Landlord to Tenant of this Lease shall have no binding force or effect, shall not constitute an option for the leasing of the Premises, nor confer any right or impose any obligations upon either party until execution of this Lease by both parties. 
  (g)        Limitations on Interest  .  It is expressly the intent of Landlord and Tenant at all times to comply with applicable law governing the maximum rate or amount of any interest payable on or in connection with this Lease.  If applicable law is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any interest called for under this Lease, or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved, or received with respect to this Lease, then it is Landlord s and Tenant s express intent that all excess amounts theretofore collected by Landlord be credited on the applicable obligation (or, if the obligation has been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to Tenant), and the provisions of this Lease immediately shall be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder. 
  (h)        Choice of Law  .  Construction and interpretation of this Lease shall be governed by the internal laws of the state in which the Premises are located, excluding any principles of conflicts of laws. 
  (i)        Time  .  Time is of the essence as to the performance of Tenant s obligations under this Lease. 
  (j)        OFAC  .  Tenant and Landlord are currently (a) in compliance with and shall at all times during the Term of this Lease remain in compliance with the regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (   OFAC   ) of the U.S. Department of Treasury and any statute, executive order, or regulation relating thereto (collectively, the    OFAC Rules   ), (b) not listed on, and shall not during the term of this Lease be listed on, the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, Foreign Sanctions Evaders List, or the Sectoral Sanctions Identification List, which are all maintained by OFAC and/or on any other similar list maintained by OFAC or other governmental authority pursuant to any authorizing statute, executive order, or regulation, and (c) not a person or entity with whom a U.S. person is prohibited from conducting business under the OFAC Rules. 
  (k)        Incorporation by Reference  .  All exhibits and addenda attached hereto are hereby incorporated into this Lease and made a part hereof.  If there is any conflict between such exhibits or addenda and the terms of this Lease, such exhibits or addenda shall control. 

Exhibit 10.10 
    
  3215 Merryfield/Vertex - Page 46 

   (l)        Entire Agreement  .  This Lease, including the exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between Landlord and Tenant pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, letters of intent, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties, and there are no warranties, representations or other agreements, express or implied, made to either party by the other party in connection with the subject matter hereof except as specifically set forth herein. 
  (m)        No Accord and Satisfaction  .  No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the monthly installment of Base Rent or any Additional Rent will be other than on account of the earliest stipulated Base Rent and Additional Rent, nor will any endorsement or statement on any check or letter accompanying a check for payment of any Base Rent or Additional Rent be an accord and satisfaction.  Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord s right to recover the balance of such Rent or to pursue any other remedy provided in this Lease. 
  (n)        Hazardous Activities  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, Landlord, for itself and its employees, agents and contractors, reserves the right to refuse to perform any repairs or services in any portion of the Premises which, pursuant to Tenant s routine safety guidelines, practices or custom or prudent industry practices, require any form of protective clothing or equipment other than safety glasses.  In any such case, Tenant shall contract with parties who are acceptable to Landlord, in Landlord s reasonable discretion, for all such repairs and services, and Landlord shall, to the extent required, equitably adjust Tenant s Share of Operating Expenses in respect of such repairs or services to reflect that Landlord is not providing such repairs or services to Tenant.   
  (o)        Redevelopment of Project  .  Tenant acknowledges that Landlord, in its sole discretion, may, subject to the terms of the fourth sentence of   Section 1   and the limitations set forth in this   Section 46(o)  , from time to time expand, renovate and/or reconfigure the Project as the same may exist from time to time and, in connection therewith or in addition thereto, as the case may be, from time to time without limitation:  (a) change the shape, size, location, number and/or extent of any improvements, buildings, structures, lobbies, hallways, entrances, exits, parking and/or parking areas relative to any portion of the Project; (b) modify, eliminate and/or add any buildings, improvements, and parking structure(s) either above or below grade, to the Project, the Common Areas and/or any other portion of the Project and/or make any other changes thereto affecting the same; and (c) make any other changes, additions and/or deletions in any way affecting the Project and/or any portion thereof as Landlord may elect from time to time, including without limitation, additions to and/or deletions from the land comprising the Project, the Common Areas and/or any other portion of the Project; provided, however, in no event may Landlord make any changes to the Building (including the subterranean parking garage) or, subject to the terms of the immediately following paragraph, reduce the parking spaces available to Tenant and in no event shall Tenant s use of the Exclusive Use Areas including, but not limited to, the courtyard/meadow area located on the east side of the Building facing the canyons be materially or adversely affected. Landlord shall consult with Tenant if Landlord plans to make any changes to the Project pursuant to this   Section 46(o)   that would materially adversely affect the entrance to the Building. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Tenant shall have no right to seek damages (including abatement of Rent) or to cancel or terminate this Lease because of any proposed changes, expansion, renovation or reconfiguration of the Project nor shall Tenant have the right to restrict, inhibit or prohibit any such changes, expansion, renovation or reconfiguration; provided, however, Landlord shall not change the size, dimensions, location or Tenant s Permitted Use of the Premises (including the subterranean parking garage). 
  If, at any time during the Term, Landlord elects to expand, renovate and/or reconfigure the Project pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph, Landlord shall have the right, exercisable upon 30 days prior written notice to Tenant to relocate all or any portion of Tenant s parking spaces hereunder on a temporary basis during such expansion, renovation and/or reconfiguration to one or more locations designated by Landlord in the Torrey Pines area of San Diego within a one-mile radius of the Premises.  Landlord shall, at Landlord s sole cost and expense (and not as an Operating Expense), provide a shuttle service between such locations and the Project.

EXHIBIT A 
  Adjustments to Vesting Schedule 

A) 
    Death of the Participant  . If the Participant dies while an Employee, Non-Employee Director, consultant or advisor of the Company or an Affiliate, 100% of the remaining Shares subject to this Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be accelerated and shall be delivered to the Participant s Survivors as soon as practicable, but no more than 90 days, after the Participant s date of death.  
       
           B) 
    Termination for Cause.    If the Participant s employment with the Company is terminated due to Cause, any portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested prior to the date written notice of such termination is provided to the Participant shall be immediately forfeited.  If the Company is investigating or evaluating whether the Company will terminate Participant s employment or other service to the Company for Cause, the Company may, at its election, suspend the vesting of this Restricted Stock Unit Award by written notice to the Participant. If after such notification it is determined or otherwise agreed that Participant s service to the Company will not be terminated for Cause, vesting of the Shares shall resume pursuant to the original schedule and any Shares that would have vested during such suspension immediately shall vest.  However, if the period of the investigation extends beyond 90 days after the Restricted Stock Unit Award otherwise vests, any Shares that would have otherwise become vested during the period of suspension shall become vested on such 90th day.  In such event, any Shares of Common Stock delivered while the Company s investigation is pending shall be non-transferable until the conclusion of the investigation without a determination that Cause for termination exists, and such Common Stock shall be immediately forfeited by the Participant and returned to the Company if the Company determines that Cause for the Participant s termination exists.   
       
           C) 
    Retirement Provision.    If a Participant experiences a Termination of Service other than for Cause, and the Participant is a Qualified Participant (as defined below), then the FCP % of the remaining Shares subject to this Restricted Stock Unit Award that have not previously vested shall vest as of the date of the Termination of Service.   
       
    A    Qualified Participant    shall mean a Participant who meets all of the following conditions: (i) he or she is at least fifty-five (55) years old, (ii) he or she has completed at least five (5) full years of service as an Employee and/or a Non-Employee Director to the Company or an Affiliate, (iii) his or her age plus full years of service as an Employee and/or a Non-Employee Director to the Company or an Affiliate is 65 or greater and (iv) he or she has completed a mandatory transitional period of employment with the Company following written notice of the Termination of Service by the Participant, the duration of which will be no fewer than twelve (12) months, except as may be determined by the Company in its sole discretion or as may be required by applicable law.  
    
    The    FCP %    shall be equal to (a) the sum of 50% plus 10% for each full year of service as an Employee and/or a Non-Employee Director to the Company or an Affiliate in excess of five (5) full years of service.

    ARTICLE 2          Eligibility and Enrollment

  22064000v.7 

Exhibit 10.27 

   2.1              Eligibility  .    All non-employee Directors of Vertex shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. 
  2.2        Commencement of Participation  .    As a condition to enrolling in the Plan, each Director shall execute and return to the Administrator any such forms required by the Administrator to elect his or her deferral amounts and designate a Beneficiary. 
  2.3        Election to Defer  .    A Participant may make separate periodic elections to defer (a) either 0%, 50%, or 100% of the Participant s cash Compensation to be earned during an applicable Plan Year (or, if applicable, the portion of the Plan Year) and (b) either 0% or 100% of the Restricted Stock Units granted to a Participant that vest not less than 12 months from the date of the election.  A deferral election shall be irrevocable once made.  The Administrator may limit or decline to accept a deferral election to the extent that it determines that Deferred Stock Units are not available for issuance under the Stock and Option Plan. 
    2.4            Date for Filing Elections  .       Each Director may elect to defer Compensation by executing and returning to the Administrator the required forms.  The elections must be made by the following deadlines:   
           2.4.1 
    For deferrals of cash Compensation, the election must be made no later than the end of the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the cash Compensation is to be earned.  If a Director first becomes eligible for this Plan during a Plan Year, an election to defer cash Compensation to be earned for the remainder of that Plan Year shall be made within 30 days of the initial date of eligibility for this Plan.  
              2.4.2 
    For deferrals of Restricted Stock Units, the election must be made on or before the earliest to occur of (i) the 30th day after the Director obtains the legally binding right to the grant of Restricted Stock Units and     (ii) 12 months prior to the date that the substantial risk of forfeiture with respect to such Restricted Stock Units lapses (other than due to death, Disability or a Change in Control).  Such election shall comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(a)(5). 
     The Administrator shall establish from time to time such other enrollment requirements as it determines in its sole and absolute discretion are necessary. 
    ARTICLE 3          Vesting and Earnings Crediting 
    3.1              Withholding of Compensation; Conversion into Deferred Stock Units  .   Compensation shall be withheld as elected by the Participant at the time the Compensation otherwise would have been paid to the Participant.  The dollar value of the amount withheld will be converted into Deferred Stock Units (including fractions thereof) by dividing the amount withheld by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date such Compensation would otherwise have been paid to the Director; and such Deferred Stock Units will be credited to the Participant s Account Balance at such time.   
    3.2              Crediting of Dividends and Distributions  .    Dividend equivalents shall be credited to each Deferred Stock Unit on each dividend payment date (based on Deferred Stock Units held as of the dividend record date) to the extent of any dividends issued on Common Stock.  Such dividend equivalents shall themselves be converted into Deferred Stock Units as of the dividend payment date by dividing the amount of the dividend equivalents by the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock as of the applicable dividend payment date.  Any such additional Deferred Stock Units (or fraction thereof) resulting from dividend equivalent credits shall be treated as Deferred Stock Units and credited to the Participant s Account Balance.  The right to credits for dividend equivalents shall survive the termination of this Plan and the termination of the Stock and Option Plan until the Deferred Stock Units have been distributed pursuant to Section 4.1. 
  3.3        Substitution of Cash  .    If the Administrator determines that Deferred Stock Units are not available for issuance under the Stock and Option Plan for any reason, the Administrator shall credit the Participant s Account Balance with cash in lieu of the Deferred Stock Units that the Participant would otherwise be entitled to.  Cash credited to a Participant s Account Balance shall be credited with interest on a monthly basis at the prime rate plus one percent (1%) per annum.  Such credits shall continue until the Account Balance has been distributed pursuant to Section 4.1 or until such cash is converted to Deferred Stock Units in accordance with the last sentence of this Section 3.3.  If additional Deferred Stock Units subsequently become available for issuance under the Stock and Option Plan, the Administrator shall, as of the date the additional Deferred Stock Units become available for issuance, automatically convert any cash in the Participant s Account Balance into Deferred Stock Units by dividing the amount of cash in the Participant s Account Balance by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date the additional Deferred Stock Units become available for issuance; and such Deferred Stock Units will be credited to the Participant s Account Balance at such time. 
    3.4              Vesting  .    A Participant shall at all times be one hundred percent (100%) vested in his or her Account Balance. 
    ARTICLE 4          Distribution of Benefits 
    4.1            Distribution Events  .    Upon the earliest to occur of (a) the Termination of the Director s service on the Board, (b) a Change in Control, (c) the Director s Disability or (d) the Director s death, the Participant (or his or her Beneficiary in the event of the Participant s death) shall receive a lump sum distribution of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the sum of (i) the number of Deferred Stock Units in his or her Account Balance plus (ii) such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the amount of cash in the Account Balance on the date of distribution divided by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of such date.  The distribution shall be made no later than the 15th day of the third month after the event described above that results in the distribution. 
    4.2              Form of Benefit  .    A Participant or his or her Beneficiary entitled to a distribution under Section 4.1 shall receive his or her Account Balance as a lump sum payable in whole shares of Common Stock.  No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued under the Plan.  If the calculation of the total number of shares of Common Stock to be issued under this Plan results in fractional shares, then the number of shares of Common Stock will be rounded up to the nearest whole share of Common Stock.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrator determines that Common Stock may not be distributed to a Participant for any reason under the Stock and Option Plan, the Administrator shall, in lieu of Common Stock, make a cash payment to the Participant in an amount equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Common Stock the Participant otherwise would have received. 
  4.3        Designation of Beneficiary  .    A Participant may designate a Beneficiary by so notifying the Administrator in writing, in a form acceptable to the Administrator, at any time before the Participant s death.  A Participant may revoke any Beneficiary designation or designate a new Beneficiary at any time without the consent of a Beneficiary or any other person.  If no Beneficiary is designated or no designated Beneficiary survives the Participant, distribution or payment shall be made to the Participant s spouse or, if the Participant does not have a surviving spouse, to his or her estate.  If the Administrator has any doubt as to the proper Beneficiary to receive distribution or payments pursuant to this Plan, the Administrator shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to withhold such payments until this matter is resolved to the Administrator s satisfaction. 
  4.4        Delay of Distribution or Payment  .    A distribution or payment otherwise required to be made under the terms of the Plan may be delayed solely to the extent necessary under the following circumstances, provided that the distribution or payment is made as soon as possible within the first taxable year of the Participant after the reason for delay no longer applies: 
           4.4.1 
    Violation of Law  .  The Administrator reasonably determines that making the distribution or payment will violate Federal securities or other applicable laws; or 
              4.4.2 
    Other Permitted Event  . Upon such other events and conditions as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall prescribe in generally applicable guidance. 
     This Section 4.4 shall be applied to similarly-situated Participants in a reasonably consistent basis. 
  4.5        Acceleration of Distribution or Payment  .    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a distribution or payment hereunder may be accelerated, with the consent of the Administrator, under the following circumstances: 
           4.5.1 
    Compliance with Domestic Relations Order  .  To permit distribution or payment to an individual other than the Participant as necessary to comply with the provisions of a domestic relations order (as defined in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B)); 
              4.5.2 
    Conflicts of Interest  .  To permit distribution or payment as necessary to comply with the provisions of a Federal government ethics agreement or to avoid violation of an applicable Federal, state, local or foreign ethics law or conflicts of interest law; or 
              4.5.3 
    Tax Event  .  Upon a good faith, reasonable determination by the Administrator, and upon advice of counsel, that the Plan fails to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A and regulations thereunder.  Such distribution or payment may not exceed the amount required to be included in income as a result of the failure to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A. 
       ARTICLE 5          Administration 
    5.1              Committee Duties  .    This Plan shall be administered by the Administrator.  The Administrator also shall have the discretion and authority to make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and decide or resolve any and all questions including interpretations of this Plan, as may arise in connection with the Plan.  All such interpretations or decisions by the Administrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on all Participants and any Beneficiary or other person claiming under or through any Participant, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the Administrator acted arbitrarily and capriciously.  The Administrator shall have the authority to deviate from the literal terms of the Plan to the extent it shall determine to be necessary or appropriate to operate the Plan in compliance with the provisions of applicable law.  Any individual serving on the Committee, or as the Administrator, who is a Participant will not vote or act on any matter relating solely to himself or herself. 
    5.2              Agents  .    In the administration of this Plan, the Administrator may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit and may from time to time consult with counsel, including counsel to Vertex. 
    5.3              Indemnity of Committee and Administrator  .    Vertex shall indemnify and hold harmless the members of the Committee and the Administrator against any and all claims, losses, damages, expenses or liabilities arising from any action or failure to act with respect to this Plan, except in the case of willful misconduct by the Committee or any of its members, or the Administrator. 
    ARTICLE 6          Miscellaneous 
    6.1              Unsecured General Creditor  .    Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable right, interest or claim in any property or assets of Vertex.  Vertex s obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money or issue Common Stock in the future with respect to its Participants. 
    6.2              Vertex s Liability  .    Vertex s liability for the distribution or payment of benefits shall be defined only by the Plan.  Vertex shall have no obligation to a Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan except as expressly provided in the Plan.

Exhibit 10.27 

   6.3              Taxes  .    It shall be the sole responsibility of the Participant to properly account for and to pay any income and self-employment tax payable on amounts deferred or benefits paid under this Plan. 
  6.4        No Rights as a Shareholder  .    No Participant shall have rights as a shareholder, including voting rights, with respect to any Deferred Stock Units that are held for his or her benefit under the Plan. 
    6.5              Nonassignability  .    Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage, or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt, the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, which amounts are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be unassignable and non transferable.  No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to distribution or payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant s or any other person s bankruptcy or insolvency.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vertex shall comply with the terms of a domestic relations order applicable to a Participant s interest in the Plan, provided that such order does not require the distribution or payment of benefits in a manner or amount, or at a time, inconsistent with the terms of the Plan.  Vertex shall have no liability to any Participant or Beneficiary to the extent that his or her benefit is reduced in accordance with the terms of a domestic relations order that Vertex applies in good faith. 
  6.6        Adjustments  .  Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, a Participant s rights with respect to any Deferred Stock Units shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided: 
           6.6.1 
    Stock Splits  . If the shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or combined into a greater or smaller number of shares, the number of Deferred Stock Units shall be appropriately increased or decreased. 
              6.6.2 
    Consolidations or Mergers  . In the event of a consolidation or merger in which Vertex is not the surviving corporation or which results in the acquisition of substantially all Vertex s outstanding stock by a single person or entity or by a group of persons and/or entities acting in concert, or in the event of the sale or transfer of substantially all Vertex s assets (any of the foregoing, an    Acquisition   ), if such Acquisition does not result in a Change in Control, all outstanding Deferred Stock Units at the time of the Acquisition shall be assumed by the surviving or acquiring entity or an affiliate thereof or replaced with rights with a value immediately after the Acquisition equivalent to the aggregate value of the Deferred Stock Units immediately before such Acquisition.  If the Acquisition results in a Change in Control, Deferred Stock Units shall be payable pursuant to Section 4.1. 
              6.6.3 
    Recapitalization or Reorganization  . In the event of a recapitalization or reorganization of Vertex that does not result in a Change in Control, pursuant to which securities of Vertex or of another corporation are issued with respect to the outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Participant shall be entitled to replacement rights with an aggregate value equivalent to that of the Deferred Stock Units that constituted the Participant s Account Balance immediately prior to such recapitalization or reorganization.  If the recapitalization or reorganization results in a Change in Control, Deferred Stock Units shall be payable pursuant to Section 4.1. 
              6.6.4 
    Adjustments to Deferred Stock Units  .

  WHEREAS, the Executive has been designated as a member of the Executive and Management Committees of the Company; and 
  WHEREAS, the Executive has agreed as a condition precedent to the foregoing to resign from the Board of Directors, and the Company has accepted said resignation; 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which mutually is acknowledged, the Company and the Executive (each individually a    Party   , and together the    Parties   ) agree as follows:  
  1. DEFINITIONS.  
     Base Salary    shall mean the Executive s base salary in accordance with Section 4 below.  
     Board    shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.  
     Cause    shall mean (i) the Executive is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, (ii) the Executive commits a material breach of any provision of this Agreement not involving the performance or nonperformance of duties, or (iii) the Executive, in carrying out the Executive s duties, acts or fails to act in a manner that is determined, in the sole discretion of the Board, after written notice of any such act or failure to act and a reasonable opportunity to cure the deficiency has been provided to the Executive, to be (A) willful gross neglect or (B) willful gross misconduct resulting, in either case, in material harm to the Company unless such act, or failure to act, was believed by the Executive, in good faith, to be in the best interests of the Company.   
     Change of Control    shall have the meaning set forth in the Change of Control Agreement.  
    
     Change of Control Agreement    shall mean the Change of Control letter agreement between the Company and the Executive of even date herewith. 
     Code    shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Exhibit 10.34 

   plan or program exists at the time of disability, then a  disability  as defined under Section 22(e)(3) of the Code. 
     Effective Date    shall mean January 12, 2015.  
     Good Reason    shall mean that, without the Executive s consent, one or more of the following events occurs:  
           (i) 
     the Executive s duties are materially diminished to an extent that results in either (A) the Executive no longer being an  officer,  as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or (B) the Executive ceases to be a member of the executive management team of the Company; or 
              (ii)

              (iii) 
    the office to which the Executive is assigned is relocated to a place 35 or more miles away and such relocation is not at the Executive s request or with the Executive s prior agreement (and other than, for Executives assigned to the Company s principal executive offices, in connection with a change in location of the Company s principal executive offices);

           (c) 
    in carrying out your duties you commit (i) willful gross negligence, or (ii) willful gross misconduct, resulting in either case in material harm to the Company,   unless   such act, or failure to act, was believed by you, in good faith, to be in the best interests of the Company; or  
       
           (d) 
    your violation of the Company s policies made known to you regarding confidentiality, securities trading or inside information. 
       
           2. 
       Change of Control    shall mean that: 
       
           (a) 
    any  person   or  group  as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the    Act   ), becomes a beneficial owner, as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Act, of securities of the Company representing more than 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding securities of the Company having the right to vote in the election of directors; or

       Good Reason    shall mean one of the following events has occurred without your consent:

To avoid doubt, the termination of your employment would become effective at the close of business on the thirtieth day after the Company receives your termination notice, unless the Company cures or eliminates the event giving rise to Good Reason prior to such time. 
    
           6. 
       Termination Date    shall mean the last day of your employment with the Company. 

Exhibit 10.35 

            II. 
    Severance Benefits upon Change of Control  .  If: 
              (A) 
    your employment is terminated by the Company (except for termination for Cause or due to a Disability) and the Termination Date is within 90 days prior to a Change of Control or within 12 months after a Change of Control; or  
              (B) 
    you, of your own initiative, (i) terminate your employment for Good Reason (in accordance with the notice and cure provisions set forth in Section I.5 above) and (ii) the event giving rise to Good Reason occurs within 90 days prior to a Change of Control or within 12 months after a Change of Control; 
     then, you shall receive the following benefits: 
    
           1. 
    Severance Payment  .  In exchange for your execution within 60 days of the Termination Date of a general release, in a form satisfactory to the Company, of all claims against the Company, its subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors and representatives, that becomes enforceable and irrevocable within such 60-day period, the Company shall make a cash payment (the    Severance Payment   ) to you in an amount equal to: 
       
           (a) 
    (i) your annual base salary (provided, however, that if you terminate your employment for Good Reason based on a reduction in your annual base salary, then the annual base salary to be used in calculating the Severance Payment shall be your annual base salary in effect immediately prior to such reduction in annual base salary) plus your target bonus under any bonus program applicable to you for the year in which the Termination Date occurs; plus  
       
           (b) 
    a prorata portion of your target bonus for the portion of the year in which the Termination Date occurs under any bonus program applicable to you; plus 
       
           (c) 
    all cash incentive compensation awards earned by you but not paid prior to the Termination Date; provided that, if a fiscal year has been completed and the incentive award for such fiscal year has not been determined, the incentive compensation for such completed fiscal year shall equal the target bonus for such fiscal year.   
       
  Except with respect to any portion of the Severance Payment that is delayed as set forth in this paragraph, the Severance Payment shall be made in cash within ten days after the execution by you of the general release referred to above and expiration without revocation of any applicable revocation periods under such general release (or, if the Change of Control resulting in your becoming entitled to such benefits occurs after such execution and expiration, within ten days after the Change of Control), provided that, if the 60-day period during which the general  release is required to become effective and irrevocable begins in one calendar year and ends in another calendar year, the Severance Payment shall not be made before the first day of the second calendar year.  The Severance Payment shall be divided into two portions, consisting of a portion that does not constitute  nonqualified deferred compensation  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and a portion, if  

Exhibit 10.35 

   any, that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. If you are a  specified employee  as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, the commencement of the delivery of any such payments that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation payable upon a  separation from service  under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code will be delayed until the first business day that is more than six months after your Termination Date.  The determination of whether, and the extent to which, any of the payments to be made to you hereunder are nonqualified deferred compensation shall be made after the application of all applicable exclusions, including those set forth under Treasury Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(9). Any payments that are intended to qualify for the exclusion for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service set forth in Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) must be paid no later than the last day of the second taxable year following the taxable year in which the Termination Date occurs.  To the extent that the termination of your employment does not constitute a separation of service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code (as the result of further services that are reasonably anticipated to be provided by you to the Company at the time your employment is terminated), the payment of any non-qualified deferred compensation will be further delayed until the first business day that is more than six months after the date of a subsequent event constituting a separation of service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code. 
    
           2. 
    Accelerated Vesting.    
       
           (a) 
    On the Termination Date, stock options for the purchase of the Company s securities held by you as of the Termination Date and not then exercisable shall immediately become exercisable in full.  The options to which this accelerated vesting applies shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (a) the end of the 90-day period immediately following the later of (i) the Termination Date or (ii) the date of the Change of Control and (b) the date the stock option(s) would otherwise expire; and 
       
           (b) 
    On the Termination Date, the Company s lapsing repurchase right with respect to shares of restricted stock held by you shall lapse in full (subject to your making satisfactory arrangements with the Company providing for the payment to the Company of all required withholding taxes).   
       
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the terms of any option agreement or restricted stock agreement shall govern the acceleration, if any, of vesting or lapsing of the Company s repurchase rights and period of exercisability of such awards, as applicable, except to the extent that the terms of this Agreement are more favorable to you. 
    
           3. 
    Continued Insurance Coverage  .  If COBRA coverage is elected by you, the Company shall pay the cost of insurance continuation premiums on your behalf (whether or not covered by COBRA) to continue standard medical, dental and life insurance coverage for you (or the cash equivalent of same if you are ineligible for continued coverage) until the earlier of (i) the date 12 months after the Termination Date or (ii) the date you begin receiving substantially equivalent coverage and benefits through a subsequent employer.    
       
           4. 
    No Mitigation.    You shall not be required to mitigate the amount of the Severance Payment or any other benefit provided under this Agreement by seeking other employment or  

Exhibit 10.35 

   otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement be reduced (except as provided in Article II Section 3(ii)) by any compensation earned by you as the result of other employment, by retirement benefits, or be offset against any amount claimed to be owed by you to the Company or otherwise (except for any required withholding taxes); provided, that if the Company makes any other severance payments to you under any other program or agreement, such amounts shall be offset against the payments the Company is obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement. 
    
           III. 
    Miscellaneous  .  
       
           1. 
    Employee s Obligations  .  Upon the termination of employment, you shall promptly deliver to the Company all property of the Company and all material documents, statistics, account records, programs and other similar tangible items which may by in your possession or under your control and which relate in a material way to the business or affairs of the Company or its subsidiaries, and no copies of any such documents or any part thereof shall be retained by you.  
       
           2. 
    Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement and the    Employee Non-Disclosure, Non-Competition   Inventions Agreement    previously executed by you covers the entire understanding of the parties as to the subject matter hereof, superseding all prior understandings and agreements related hereto, including the previous Change of Control Agreement between you and the Company.  No modification or amendment of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the parties or their respective duly authorized agents, provided, however, that the Company may, without your consent, unilaterally adopt amendments that may be required so that this Agreement continues to comply with applicable law or regulation, including without limitation Section 409A of the Code, provided such amendments do not adversely affect the benefits to be provided to you under Section II of this Agreement. 
       
           3. 
    Governing Law  .  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as applied to contracts entered into and performed entirely in Massachusetts by Massachusetts residents.   
       
           4. 
    Successors and Assigns  .  This Agreement may be assigned by the Company upon a sale, transfer or reorganization of the Company.  Upon a Change of Control, the Company shall require the successor to assume the Company s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  The Company s failure to do so shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors, permitted assigns, legal representatives and heirs.

   Kindly indicate your acceptance of the foregoing by signing and dating this Agreement as noted below, and returning one fully executed original to my attention.

Vertex Employee Compensation Plan 
    
  On an annual basis in the first quarter of the fiscal year the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors adopts an employee compensation plan for our officers and other employees, including our named executive officers, together with performance goals for that fiscal year. The plan addresses three components of employee compensation base salary, performance bonuses which serve as short-term incentives and equity grants which serve as long-term incentives that are designed to motivate, reward and retain employees by aligning compensation with the achievement of strategic corporate goals. 
    
  Upon completion of each performance period (usually a calendar year), our Board of Directors assigns a performance rating on the basis of achievement of goals for the company set by the Board, in consultation with our chief executive officer, early in the performance period. The amount available for payment of performance bonuses is established on the basis of this performance rating, and is allocated to employees on the basis of salary tier and individual performance rating. The base salaries of the executive officers are set based on market and other competitive factors. Merit increases to base salaries for other employees are made on the basis of individual performance rating. Annual equity grants, made in the form of stock options, restricted stock grants or units, or a combination of both are made on the basis of salary tier and individual performance. 
    
  The Board of Directors retains broad discretion to determine the appropriate form and level of compensation, particularly for our executives, on the basis of its assessment of our executives, the demand for talent, our performance and other factors. Key corporate performance factors generally include, among other things, achievement of regulatory and commercialization goals, research and development productivity, enhancements of organizational capabilities, financial goals and other aspects of our performance. We reserve the right to modify the plan, and the key corporate performance factors and criteria under the plan, at any time. 
    
  On February 2, 2016, the Board of Directors determined the cash bonus awards related to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and annual salaries effective February 2016.  In addition, the Board of Directors granted our named executive officers equity grants under the 2013 Stock and Option Plan which will be described in detail in our 2016 proxy statement.  These grants reflect a transition from a share-based approach to a value-based approach.  The grants included performance share units that will only vest based on achievement of financial or business goals.
