The Sub-Plan is intended to provide eligible Employees of the Company s Affiliates the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company through the purchase of shares of the Company s common stock at periodic intervals with their accumulated payroll deductions or other approved contributions.  The Sub-Plan is not intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 (b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
  All provisions of this Sub-Plan shall be governed by the U.S. Plan, except as otherwise provided herein. 
  2.        Definitions  . 
  All definitions in the Sub-Plan shall be interpreted in accordance with the U.S. Plan except as otherwise provided herein. 
  (a)         Affiliate  shall mean a corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business entity, or branch of such business entity, domestic or foreign, of which not less than 50% of the voting shares are held by the Company or a Subsidiary, whether or not such corporation now exists or is hereafter organized or acquired by the Company or an Affiliate. 
  (b)         Employee  shall mean any person employed by an Affiliate.  
  (c)         Participant  means any Employee who meets the eligibility and participation requirements set forth in Sections 3 and 4, below. 
  3.        Eligibility  .  Each individual who is (a) an Employee as of the date specified by the Committee for the applicable Offering Period, and (b) employed by an Affiliate (or legal extension of an Affiliate, such as a branch office) operating in one of the countries listed on the attached Schedule A (which Schedule A may be amended form time to time by the Board or a committee thereof), shall be eligible to participate in the Sub-Plan for that Offering Period. 
  4.        Participation  . 
  
   1 

Exhibit 10.15 

(a)        An eligible Employee may become a Participant in the Plan by completing a subscription agreement authorizing payroll deductions or other approved contributions on the form provided by the Company and filing it online via the employee portal or with the Company s payroll office within the period specified by the Committee for the applicable Offering Period, unless a later or earlier time for filing the subscription agreement is set by the Board for all eligible Employees with respect to a given offering.   
  (b)        Payroll deductions for a Participant shall continue at the rate specified in the subscription agreement throughout the Offering Period with automatic re-enrollment for the Offering Period which commences the day after the Exercise Date at the same rate specified in the original subscription agreement, subject to any change in subscription rate made pursuant to Section 6(c) of the U.S. Plan, unless sooner terminated by the participant as provided in Section 11 of the U.S. Plan.

  (c)        For purposes of determining the number of shares purchasable by a participant, the payroll deductions or other approved contributions credited to each participant s book account during each Exercise Period shall be converted into U.S. Dollars on the Exercise Date for that Exercise Period on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on such date.  The Board shall have the absolute discretion to determine the applicable exchange rate to be in effect for each Exercise Date by any reasonable method (including, without limitation, the exchange rate actually used by the Company for its intra-Company financial transactions for the month of such transfer).  Any changes or fluctuations in the exchange rate at which the payroll deductions or other approved contributions collected on the participant s behalf are converted into U.S. Dollars on each Exercise Date shall be borne solely by the participant. 
  6.        Grant of Option  .  The grant of the option and the purchase price of the option shall be in accordance with Section 7 of the U.S. Plan. 
  7.        Exercise of Option  .  The exercise of the option shall be in accordance with Section 8 of the U.S. Plan.

8.        Withdrawal; Termination of Employment  . 
  (a)        A Participant may withdraw all but not less than all the payroll deductions or other approved contributions credited to his or her account under the Sub-Plan at any time prior to the Exercise Date of the Offering Period by giving written notice to the Company.

The Board may also adopt rules, procedures or sub-plans applicable to particular Affiliates or jurisdictions.  The rules of such sub-plans may take precedence over other provisions of this Sub-Plan, with the exception of Section 11 of the Sub-Plan, but unless otherwise superseded by the terms of such sub-plan, the provisions of the Sub-Plan shall govern the operation of such sub-plan. 
  13.        Transferability  .

Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds in accordance with Section 11 of the U.S. Plan.

Exhibit 10.15 

16.        Amendment or Termination  .  The Board of Directors of the Company or its Committee appointed pursuant to the U.S. Plan may at any time terminate or amend the Sub-Plan.  No such termination can affect options previously granted, nor may an amendment make any change in any option theretofore granted which adversely affects the rights of any participant. 
  Notwithstanding any provision of the U.S. Plan or this Sub-Plan to the contrary, in order to comply with the laws in other countries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate or have participants, the Company, by action of its duly authorized officers, in their sole discretion, shall have the power and authority at any time to establish  offering document  and similar addendums to this Sub-Plan to modify administrative procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable and take any action that it deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with any necessary local governmental regulatory exemptions or approvals.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action may be taken hereunder that would violate the Exchange Act, the Code, any securities law or governing statute or any other applicable law or cause the U.S. Plan not to comply with Section 423 of the Code. 
  17.        Notices  .  All notices or other communications by a participant to the Company under or in connection with the Sub-Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof. 
  18.        Governing Law  .  Except to the extent that provisions of this Plan are governed by applicable provisions of the Code or any other substantive provision of United States federal law, this Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof.  Should any provision of this Sub-Plan be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful or unenforceable for a country, such determination shall in no way affect the application of that provision in any other country, or any of the remaining provisions of the Sub-Plan. 
  19.        Severability  .  If any provision of this Sub-Plan is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason in any jurisdiction or as to any Employee, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect the remaining parts of the Sub-Plan, and the Sub-Plan will be construed and enforced as to such jurisdiction or Employee as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had not been included.
