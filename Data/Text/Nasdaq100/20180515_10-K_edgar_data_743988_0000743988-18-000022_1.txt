ITEM 1. 
    BUSINESS 
       
  Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx, the Company or we) designs and develops programmable devices and associated technologies, including: 

integrated circuits (ICs) in the form of programmable logic devices (PLDs), including programmable System on Chips (SoCs) and three-dimensional ICs (3D ICs); 
                
    Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP): a highly integrated multi-core heterogeneous compute platform; 
                
    software design tools to program the PLDs; 
                
    software development environments and embedded platforms; 
                
    targeted reference designs; 
                
    printed circuit boards; and 
                
    intellectual property (IP), which consists of Xilinx and various third-party verification and IP cores. 
       
  In addition to its programmable platforms, Xilinx provides design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. 
    
  Our PLDs include field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) that our customers program to perform desired logic functions, and programmable SoCs, which combine industry standard ARM processor-based systems with programmable logic in a single device. We also design and develop 3D ICs, which consist of a combination of FPGAs, transceivers and a wide memory interface in a single package to exceed the capacity and bandwidth of monolithic devices.  In addition, earlier this year we announced a new breakthrough product category called ACAP, a highly integrated multi-core heterogeneous compute platform, which extends far beyond the capabilities of an FPGAs. Our product portfolio is designed to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers in sub-segments such as wireline and data center, wireless, aerospace and defense, test and measurement, industrial, scientific and medical, automotive, audio, video and broadcast and consumer.  
    
  We sell our products and services through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and electronic manufacturing service providers (EMS). Sales are generated by these independent distributors, independent sales representative or our direct sales organization. 
    
  Xilinx was founded and incorporated in California in February 1984.  In April 1990, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware. Our corporate facilities and executive offices are located at 2100 Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124, and our website address is www.xilinx.com. 
    
  Industry Overview  
    
  There are three principal types of ICs used in most digital electronic systems: processors, which generally are utilized for control and computing tasks; memory devices, which are used for storing program instructions and data; and logic devices, which generally are used to manage the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system. Xilinx designs and develops PLDs, a type of logic device.  Alternatives to PLDs may include application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products (ASSPs).  PLDs, ASICs and ASSPs may be utilized in many of the same types of electronic systems.  However, differences in unit pricing, development cost, product performance, reliability, power consumption, capacity, features and functionality, ease of use and time-to-market determine which devices are best-suited for specific applications.

     Table of Contents  

PLDs have key competitive advantages over ASICs and ASSPs, including: 

Faster time-to-market and increased design flexibility.  Both of these advantages are enabled by Xilinx desktop software which allows users to implement and revise their designs quickly. In contrast, ASICs and ASSPs require significant development time and offer limited, if any, flexibility to make design changes.    
                
    PLDs are standard components. This means that the same device can be sold to many different users for a myriad of applications. In sharp contrast, ASICs and ASSPs are customized for an individual user or a specific application.  
       
  PLDs are generally disadvantaged in terms of relative device size when compared to chips that are designed to perform a fixed function in a single or small set of applications. ASICs and ASSPs tend to be smaller than PLDs performing the same fixed function, resulting in a lower unit cost.  However, there is a high fixed cost associated with ASIC and ASSP development that is not applicable to PLD customers. This fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development is expected to significantly increase on next generation technology nodes.  From a total cost of development perspective, ASICs and ASSPs have generally been more cost effective when used in high-volume production, and PLDs have generally been more cost effective when used in low- to mid-volume production.  However, we expect PLDs to be able to address higher volume applications and gain market share from ASIC and ASSP suppliers as the fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development increases on next generation technology nodes.

Strategy and Competition 
    
  Our strategy for growth is to displace  ASICs, ASSPs and traditional PLD  in the next generation electronic systems. Additionally, we focus on enabling  building the adaptable intelligent world" with an emphasis including the three major elements described below.  

Data center first: Xilinx is ramping up its efforts with key data center customers, ecosystem partners and software application developers, to further enable innovation and deployments in compute acceleration, computational storage and network acceleration. 
                
    Accelerated growth in core markets: core markets consists of automotive; wireless infrastructure; wired communications; audio, video and broadcast; aerospace and defense; industrial, scientific and medical; test, measurement and emulation; and consumer technologies where the Company has deep technology leadership market traction. These core markets and customers are central to Xilinx, and Xilinx continues to drive and enable innovation to these areas. 
                
    Drive adaptive computing with the introduction of ACAP: in March 2018, we announced the ACAP, which we believe is a breakthrough product category. ACAP is a highly integrated multi-core heterogeneous compute platform that can be changed at the hardware level to adapt to the needs of a wide range of applications and workloads. An ACAP's adaptability, which can be done dynamically in milliseconds during operation, delivers levels of performance and performance per-watt that is unmatched by CPUs or GPUs.  
       
  The costs and risks associated with application-specific devices can only be justified for high-volume or highly-specialized commodity products. Programmable platforms, alternatively, are becoming critical for our customers to meet increasingly stringent product requirements - cost, power, performance and density - in a business environment characterized by increased complexity, shrinking market windows, rapidly changing market demands, capped engineering budgets, escalating ASIC and ASSP  engineering costs and increased economic and development risk. 
    
  With every new generation of FPGAs, our strategy is to increase the performance, density and system-level functionality and integration, while driving down cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node. This enables us to provide simpler, smarter programmable platforms and design methodologies allowing our customers to focus on innovation and differentiation of their products. 
    
  Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continuous price erosion.  We expect continued competition from our primary PLD competitors such as Intel Corporation (Intel), Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice) and Microsemi Corporation (Microsemi), and from ASSP vendors such as Broadcom Corporation (Broadcom), Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. (Marvell) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (Texas Instruments), as well as from companies such as NVIDIA with whom we traditionally have not participated in competing markets. In addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs. Other competitors include manufacturers of: 

high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures; 
                
    high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs; 
                
    ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic;  
                
    high-speed, low-density CPLDs; 
                
    high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) devices; 
                
    products with embedded processors; 
                
    products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; and  
                
    other new or emerging programmable logic products. 
       
  We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include: 

product pricing; 
                
    time-to-market; 
                
    product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density; 
                
    field upgradability; 
                
    adaptability of products to specific applications; 
                
    ease of use and functionality of software design tools; 
                
    availability and functionality of predefined IP;  
                
    inventory and supply chain management; 
                
    access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity;  
                
    ability to provide timely customer service and support; and

EasyPath FPGAs use the same production masks and fabrication process as standard FPGAs and are tested to a specific customer application to improve yield and lower costs.  As a result, EasyPath FPGAs provide customers with significant cost reduction when compared to the standard FPGA devices without the conversion risk, engineering effort, or the additional time required to move to an ASIC.  The latest generation of EasyPath FPGAs and EasyPath-7 FPGAs provide lower total product cost of ownership for cost-reducing high performance FPGAs. 
    
  Design Platforms and Services 
    
  Programmable Platforms 
    
  We offer three types of programmable platforms that support our customers' designs and reduce their development efforts: 
    
  The Base Platform is the delivery vehicle for all of our new silicon offerings used to develop and run customer-specific software applications and hardware designs.  Released at launch, the Base Platform is comprised of: FPGA silicon; Vivado Design Suite design environment; integration support for optional third-party synthesis, simulation and signal integrity tools; reference designs; development boards and IP. 
    
  The Domain-Specific Platform targets one of the three primary Xilinx FPGA user profiles: the embedded processing developer; the DSP developer; or the logic/connectivity developer.  It accomplishes this by augmenting the Base Platform with a targeted set of integrated technologies, including: higher-level design methodologies and tools; domain-specific IP including embedded, mixed signal, video, DSP and connectivity; domain-specific development hardware and reference designs; and operating systems and software. 
    
  The Market-Specific Platform enables software or hardware developers to quickly build and run their specific application or solution. Built for specific markets such as automotive, consumer, aerospace and defense, communications, audio, video and broadcast, industrial, or scientific and medical, the Market-Specific Platform integrates both the Base and Domain-Specific Platforms with higher targeted applications elements such as IP, reference designs and boards optimized for a particular market. 
    
  Design Tools 
    
  To accommodate the various design methodologies and design flows employed by the wide range of our customers' user profiles such as system designers, algorithm designers, software coders and logic designers, we provide the appropriate design environment tailored to each user profile for design creation, design implementation and design verification. In April 2012, Xilinx introduced the next-generation Vivado Design Suite designed to improve developer productivity resulting in faster design integration and implementation. The Vivado Design Suite hallmarks include an easy-to-use IP-centric design flow and significant improvement in run times.  The standards-based Vivado tools include high-level synthesis to provide a more direct flow in retargeting DSPs and general purpose processor designs into our FPGAs, IP Integrator to rapidly stitch together cores at higher levels of abstraction, and a new analytical place-and-route engine which significantly improves run times. The Vivado Design Suite supports Xilinx 7 series FPGAs and Zynq-7000, our programmable SoCs, as well as the Ultrascale and Ultrascale+ product generations. 
    
  The previous generation tool suite, the ISE       Design Suite, supports Xilinx 7 series FPGAs, programmable SoCs and all previous generation FPGAs, enabling customers to transition to the Vivado Design Suite when the timing is right for their design needs.  Both the Vivado Design Suite and ISE Design Suite operate with a wide range of third-party Electronic Design Automation software point-tools offerings.

In early 2015, Xilinx also introduced the SDx development environment, which has significantly expanded the Xilinx user base to include the broad community of systems and software engineers in both existing and new markets. This innovative development environment also enables end user and third party platform developers to rapidly define, integrate and verify system level solutions and provide their end customers with a customized programming environment. The SDx family includes the SDNet environment, which enables the easy creation of high-performance packet processing systems with high level user defined specifications and compilation to highly optimized FPGAs; the SDAccel environment for OpenCL, C and C++ software designers focusing on data center acceleration applications; and the SDSoC environment for All Programmable SoCs and MPSoCs with broad end market applicability. 
    
  Intellectual Property 
    
  Xilinx and various third parties offer hundreds of no charge and fee-bearing IP core licenses covering Ethernet, memory controllers, Interlaken and PCIe interfaces, as well as an abundance of domain-specific IP in the areas of embedded, DSP and connectivity, and market-specific IP cores. In addition, our products and technology leverage industry standards such as ARM       AMBA AXI-4 interconnect technology, IP-XACT and IEEE P1735 encryption to facilitate plug-and-play FPGA design and take advantage of the large ecosystem of ARM IP developers. 
    
  Development Boards, Kits and Configuration Products 
    
  In addition to the broad selection of legacy development boards presently offered, we have introduced a new unified board strategy that enables the creation of a standardized and coordinated set of base boards available both from Xilinx and our ecosystem vendors, all utilizing the industry-standard extensions that enable customization for market specific applications.  Adopting this standard for all of our base boards enables the creation of a scalable and extensible delivery mechanism for all Xilinx programmable platforms. 
    
  We also offer comprehensive development kits including hardware, design tools, IP and reference designs that are designed to streamline and accelerate the development of domain-specific and market-specific applications. 
    
  Finally, Xilinx offers a range of configuration products including one-time programmable and in-system programmable storage devices to configure Xilinx FPGAs.  These programmable read-only memory (PROM) products support all of our FPGA devices. 
    
  Third-Party Alliances 
    
  Xilinx and certain third parties have developed and continue to offer a robust ecosystem of IP, boards, tools, services and support through the Xilinx alliance program.  Xilinx also works with these third parties to promote our programmable platforms through third-party tools, IP, software, boards and design services. 
    
  In May of 2016, Xilinx led the formation of the very broad Cache Coherent Interconnect Acceleration (CCIX) consortium with the singular goal of bringing a high performance, open acceleration framework to the data center market.  As of March 2018, this consortium had approximately 40 members, ranging from silicon providers to a rich ecosystem of partners including design, foundry, verification, software and system vendors. 
    
  Engineering Services 
    
  Xilinx engineering services provide customers with engineering resources to augment their design teams and to provide expert design-specific advice.  Xilinx tailors its engineering services to the needs of its customers, ranging from hands-on training to full design creation and implementation. 
    
  Research and Development 
    
  Our research and development (R D) activities are primarily directed towards the design of new ICs and the development of new software design automation tools for hardware and embedded software, the design of logic IP, the adoption of advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes for ongoing cost reductions, performance and signal integrity improvements and lowering PLD power consumption.   
    
  As a result of our R D efforts, we have introduced a number of new products during the past several years including the Virtex, Kintex, Zynq UltraScale+, Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoCs, Virtex   Kintex UltraScale and Artix, Kintex, Virtex   Zynq 7 Series program families.  We have enhanced our IP core offerings and introduced our next generation software design suite (Vivado), which is optimized for SDAccel and SDSoC application development. Through process technology collaboration with our foundry

suppliers along with strategic investment in EDA tools and improved design techniques, we have been the first PLD Company to ship 45nm high-volume, 28nm, 20nm and 16nm FPGA devices. Additionally, our investment in R D has allowed us to ship the industry's first 28nm and 16nm devices with embedded ARM technology, the industry's first All Programmable SoC with integrated RF Data Converters, as well as the industry's first 3D IC devices on the 28nm and 20nm process nodes. 
    
  We believe technical leadership and innovation are essential to our future success, and we continue to invest in our technology. In fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , our R D expenses were   $639.8 million  ,   $601.4 million   and   $533.9 million  , respectively.   
    
  Sales and Distribution 
    
  We sell our products to OEMs, EMS and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to OEMs and EMS. 
    
  We use a dedicated global sales and marketing organization, and to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives, to generate sales.  In general, we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited number of key accounts.  Distributors and independent sales representatives create demand within the balance of our customer base in defined territories.  Distributors also provide inventory, value-added services and logistics for a wide range of our OEM customers. 
    
  Whether Xilinx, the distributor, or the independent sales representative identifies the sales opportunity, a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders.  In such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they bear most legal and financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods, including such risks as credit loss, inventory shrinkage, theft and foreign currency fluctuations, but excluding certain indemnity and warranty liabilities. 
    
  In accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice, we have granted our authorized distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a change in list prices subsequent to the initial sale.  Revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the distributors' end customers. Our revenue recognition policy will change starting fiscal 2019, see "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8.  
    
  Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes the substantial majority of our products worldwide.  As of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , Avnet accounted for   60%   and   59%  , respectively, of our total net accounts receivable.  Resale of product through Avnet accounted for   43%  ,   44%   and   50%   of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  We also use other regional distributors throughout the world.  We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services.  Since PLDs are standard products, they do not carry many of the inventory risks posed by ASICs. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies, or move customers to a direct support or fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies, the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition. See "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for information about concentrations of credit risk and "Note 15. Segment Information" for information about our revenues from external customers and domestic and international operations. 
    
  No   end customer accounted for more than   10%   of our net revenues in fiscal   2018  ,   2017   or   2016  .   
    
  Backlog  
    
  As of   March 31, 2018  , our backlog from OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our distributors scheduled for delivery within the next three months was $429.0 million, compared to $356.0 million as of   April 1, 2017  .  Orders from end customers to our distributors are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation without significant penalty.  As a result, backlog from both OEM customers and end customers reported by our distributors as of any particular period may not be a reliable indicator of revenue for any future period. 
    
  Wafer Fabrication 
    
  As a fabless semiconductor company, we do not manufacture wafers used for our IC products or PROMs.  Rather, we purchase our wafers from independent foundries including TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung).  TSMC manufactures the wafers for our Advanced Products.   
    
  Precise terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations with each wafer foundry.   
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

Our strategy is to focus our resources on market development and creating new ICs and software design tools rather than on wafer fabrication.  We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance foundry relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well as other suppliers of wafers manufactured with leading-edge process technologies, and we adjust loadings at particular foundries to meet our business needs. 
     
  Sort, Assembly and Test 
    
  Wafers are sorted by the foundry or independent sort subcontractors.  Sorted die are assembled by subcontractors.  During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into individual die, which are then assembled into various package types.  Following assembly, the packaged units are generally tested by independent test subcontractors or by Xilinx personnel.  We purchase most of our assembly services from Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. and most of our test services from King Yuan Electronics Company in Taiwan. 
    
  Quality Certification 
    
  Xilinx has achieved and currently maintains quality management system certification to TL9000/ISO9001 for our facilities in San Jose, California; Longmont, Colorado; Singapore; and Hyderabad, India.  In addition, Xilinx achieved and currently maintains ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 environmental health and safety management system certifications in the San Jose and Singapore locations. 
    
  Intellectual Property and Licenses 
    
  While our various proprietary intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks) are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.  As of   March 31, 2018  , we held over 4,200 issued patents, which vary in duration, and over 800 pending patent applications relating to our proprietary technology in various jurisdictions around the world.  We maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of, but not limited to, circuits, software, IC architecture, IP cores, system design, testing methodologies and other technologies relating to our products and business.  We licensed portions of our patent portfolio to certain external parties and obtained patent licenses from certain third-parties as well.  
    
  We have acquired various licenses from third parties to certain technologies that are implemented in IP cores or embedded in our devices, such as processors.  These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products.  We have also acquired various licenses to certain third-party proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools.  Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which customers depend. 
    
  We maintain the Xilinx trade name and trademarks, including the following trademarks that are registered in the U.S. and other countries: Xilinx, the Xilinx logo, Artix, CoolRunner, ISE, Kintex, Spartan, Virtex, Vivado, and Zynq.  Maintaining these trademarks, and the goodwill associated with them, is important to our business.  We have also obtained the rights to use certain trademarks owned by consortiums and other trademark owners that are related to our products and business. 
    
  We intend to continue to protect our intellectual property vigorously.  We believe that failure to enforce our intellectual property rights or failure to protect our trade secrets effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  We incurred, and in the future we may continue to incur, litigation expenses to defend against claims of infringement and to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties.  However, any such litigation may or may not be successful. 
    
  Corporate Responsibility 
    
  Xilinx places a high level of importance on corporate responsibility. Through senior-level sponsorship, regular environmental, health and safety assessments and company-wide performance targets, we strive to achieve a culture that emphasizes contribution to local and global communities through a number of key initiatives: 
    
  Company 
    
  We strive to meet or exceed industry and regulatory standards for ethical business practices, product responsibility, and supplier management.  All of Xilinx's directors, officers and employees are required to comply not only with the letter of the laws, rules and regulations that govern the conduct of our business, but also with the spirit of those laws.

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS  
       
  The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks to the Company. Our business operations or financial condition could be impaired by risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company's management does not currently consider material. If any of the risks described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
    
  Our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and our failure to do so would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power consumption and performance. Consolidation in our industry may increasingly result in our competitors having greater resources, or other synergies, that provide them with a competitive advantage in those regards. The success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors, including:  

timely completion of new product designs;  
                
    ability to generate new design opportunities and design wins;  
                
    availability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products;  
                
    ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies on circuit geometries of 28nm and smaller;  
                
    achieving acceptable yields;  
                
    ability to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors;  
                
    ability to obtain advanced packaging;  
                
    availability of supporting software design tools;  
                
    utilization of predefined IP logic;  
                
    customer acceptance of advanced features in our new products;  
                
    ability of our customers to complete their product designs and bring them to market; and 
                
    market acceptance of our customers' products.  
       
  Our product development efforts may not be successful, our new products may not achieve industry acceptance, or we may not achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per unit cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result, we may be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from design wins for our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

of existing products, and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
    
  We rely on independent foundries for the manufacture of all of our products and a manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity could adversely affect our operations.  
    
  Most of our wafers are manufactured in Taiwan by TSMC and UMC. We also have wafers manufactured in South Korea by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined through periodic negotiations with these wafer foundries, which usually result in short-term agreements that do not provide for long-term supply or allocation commitments. We are dependent on these foundries to supply the substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on TSMC, UMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes. Therefore, the foundries, particularly TSMC which manufactures our newest products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our wafers will offer us competitive pricing terms or other commercial terms important to our business.  
    
  We cannot guarantee that our foundries will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies or difficulties due to limitations of new and existing process technologies. For example, we may experience supply shortages due to the difficulties foundries may encounter if they must rapidly increase their production capacities from low utilization levels to high utilization levels because of an unexpected increase in demand. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that the foundries will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or that they will continue to manufacture a given product for the full life of the product. We could also experience supply shortages due to very strong demand for our products, or a surge in demand for semiconductors in general, which may lead to tightening of foundry capacity across the industry.  In addition, weak economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of the foundries and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. The insolvency of a foundry or any significant manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity would disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Earthquakes or other natural disasters could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes or other natural disasters such as typhoons, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, fires or floods, as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water. The independent foundries, upon which we rely to manufacture our products, as well as our California and Singapore facilities, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters. TSMC's and UMC's foundries in Taiwan and our assembly and test partners in other regions as well as many of our operations in California are located in areas that have been seismically active in the past and some of these areas have also been affected by other natural disasters such as typhoons. Disruption of operations at these foundries and our facilities could cause delays in manufacturing and shipments of our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Any catastrophic event in these locations would disrupt our operations, and our insurance may not cover losses resulting from such disruptions of our operations, thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. For example, as a result of the March 2011 earthquake in Japan, production at the Seiko factory at Sakata was halted temporarily, impacting production of some of our older devices. In addition, suppliers of wafers and substrates were forced to halt production temporarily. Furthermore, natural disasters can also indirectly impact us. For example, our customers' supply of other complimentary products may be disrupted by a natural disaster and may cause them to delay orders of our products. More vertically-integrated competitors may be less exposed to some or all of these and other risks. 
    
  The semiconductor industry is characterized by cyclical market patterns and a significant industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results.  
    
  The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and our financial performance has been affected by downturns in the industry. Down cycles are generally characterized by price erosion and weaker demand for our products. Weaker demand for our products resulting from economic conditions in the end markets we serve and reduced capital spending by our customers can result, and in the past has resulted, in excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory write-downs. We attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market in which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and other factors, our past results are not reliable predictors of our future results. 

16 

     Table of Contents  

The nature of our business makes our revenues difficult to predict which could have an adverse impact on our business.  
    
  In addition to the challenging market conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon our products being designed into our end customers' products and those products achieving market acceptance. Due to the complexity of our customers' designs, the design to volume production process for our customers requires a substantial amount of time, frequently longer than a year. In addition, other factors may affect our end customers' demand for our products, including, but not limited to, end customer program delays and the ability of end customers to secure other complementary products. We also are dependent upon "turns," orders received and turned for shipment in the same quarter. These factors make it difficult for us to forecast future sales and project quarterly revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales impairs our ability to project our inventory requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write-downs or failure to meet customer product demands in a timely manner. In addition, difficulty in forecasting revenues compromises our ability to provide forward-looking revenue and earnings guidance. 
    
  If we are not able to compete successfully in our industry, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely affected. 
    
  Our PLDs compete in the IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive, continues to consolidate, and is characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our PLD competitors, including Intel, Lattice and Microsemi, and from new market entrants. In addition, we continue to face competition in the ASIC and ASSP markets, including competitors such as Broadcom, Marvell and Texas Instruments. We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include:  

product pricing;  
                
    time-to-market;  
                
    product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density;  
                
    field upgradeability;  
                
    adaptability of products to specific applications;  
                
    ease of use and functionality of software design tools;  
                
    availability and functionality of predefined IP logic;  
                
    inventory and supply chain management;  
                
    access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity;   
                
    ability to provide timely customer service and support; and 
                
    access to advanced packaging technology. 
       
  Our strategy for expansion in the logic market includes continued introduction of new product architectures that address high-volume, low-cost and low-power applications as well as high-performance, high-density applications. However, we may not be successful in executing this strategy.  In addition, we anticipate continued pressure from our customers to reduce prices, which may outpace our ability to lower the cost for established products.  
    
  Other competitors include manufacturers of: 

high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;  
                
    high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;  
                
    ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic;  
                
    high-speed, low-density complex programmable logic devices;  
                
    high-performance digital signal processing devices;  
                
    products with embedded processors;  
                
    products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers;  
                
    discrete general purpose GPUs targeting non-graphics applications; and  
                
    other new or emerging programmable logic products.  
       
  Several companies have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention to sell PLD products. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  
    
  The benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to this segment. We recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs. Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have developed common software  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

design tools that support the full range of our IC products. We believe that automation and ease of design are significant competitive factors in this segment.  
    
  We could also face competition from our licensees. In the past we have granted limited rights to other companies with respect to certain aspects of our older technology, and we may do so in the future. Granting such rights may enable these companies to manufacture and market products that may be competitive with some of our older products. 
    
  Increased costs of wafers and materials, or shortages in wafers and materials, could adversely impact our gross margins and lead to reduced revenues.  
    
  If greater demand for wafers is not offset by an increase in foundry capacity, market demand for wafers or production and assembly materials increases, or if a supplier of our wafers or other materials ceases or suspends operations, our supply of wafers and other materials could become limited. Such shortages raise the likelihood of potential wafer price increases, wafer shortages or shortages in materials at production and test facilities, resulting in potential inability to address customer product demands in a timely manner. For example, in 2011, when certain suppliers located in Japan were forced to temporarily halt production as the result of a natural disaster, this resulted in a tightening of supply for those materials. Such shortages of wafers and materials as well as increases in wafer or materials prices could adversely affect our gross margins and would adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands and lead to reduced revenue.  
    
  We depend on distributors, primarily Avnet, to generate a significant portion of our sales and complete order fulfillment.  
    
  Resale of product through Avnet accounted for   43%   of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal   2018  , and, as of   March 31, 2018  , Avnet accounted for   60%   of our total net accounts receivable. Any adverse change to our relationship with Avnet or our other distributors could have a material impact on our business. Furthermore, if a key distributor materially defaulted on a contract or otherwise failed to perform, our business and financial results would suffer. In addition, we are subject to concentrations of credit risk in our trade accounts receivable, which includes accounts of our distributors. A significant reduction of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a material change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products.   
    
  In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health of some of these distributors, particularly our smaller distributors. This could increase our credit risk exposure relating to the insolvency of certain distributors, the inability of distributors to obtain credit to finance the purchase of our products, or delayed payment for such purchases. Our business could be harmed if the financial health of these distributors impaired their performance and we were unable to secure alternate distributors. 
    
  We are dependent on independent subcontractors for most of our assembly and test services, and unavailability or disruption of these services could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  We are dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly, substrate, test and shipment services. Any (i) prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, (ii) disruption in assembly, test or shipment services, (iii) delays in stabilizing manufacturing processes and ramping up volume for new products, (iv) transitions to new service providers, or (v) other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply, could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands. In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of these subcontractors and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. These factors would result in reduced net revenues and could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  A number of factors, including our inventory strategy, can impact our gross margins. 
    
  A number of factors can cause our gross margins to fluctuate, including yield, wafer pricing, product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing dynamics, licensing costs, geographic and/or market segment pricing strategies. In addition, forecasting our gross margins is difficult because a significant portion of our business is based on turns within the same quarter. 
    
  While our overall inventory levels fluctuate over time, the inventory of newer product lines may be higher than other products due to a planned increase in safety stock in anticipation of future revenue growth.  In the event demand does not materialize, we may be subject to incremental obsolescence costs. In addition, future product cost reductions could have impact on our inventory valuation as well as our operating results.  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents  

Reductions in the average selling prices of our products could have a negative impact on our gross margins.  
    
  The average selling prices of our products generally decline as the products mature. We seek to offset the decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and increased unit sales. We also continue to develop higher value products or product features that increase the average selling prices of our products, or slow the decline of such prices. However, there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline in selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in our revenues and gross margins. 
    
  General negative economic conditions and any related deterioration in the global business environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
    
  If weak economic conditions happen, there may be a number of negative effects on our business, including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, the insolvency of key suppliers, potentially causing production delays, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables and ultimately decrease our net revenues and profitability. 
    
  We are subject to the risks associated with conducting business operations outside of the U.S. which could adversely affect our business. 
    
  In addition to international sales and support operations and development activities, we purchase our wafers from foreign foundries, have our commercial products assembled, packaged and tested by subcontractors located outside the U.S. and utilize third party warehouse operators to store and manage inventory levels for certain of our products.  All of these activities are subject to the uncertainties associated with international business operations, including global laws and regulations, trade barriers, economic sanctions, tax regulations, import and export regulations, duties and tariffs and other trade restrictions, changes in trade policies, anti-corruption laws, foreign governmental regulations, potential vulnerability of and reduced protection for IP, longer receivable collection periods and disruptions or delays in production or shipments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results. For example, on March 8, 2016, the U.S. Department of Commerce added ZTE Corporation (ZTE) to its "Entity List" and placed certain export restrictions on ZTE and its suppliers.  Although the U.S. Department of Commerce and ZTE reached a settlement effective on March 23, 2017, which removed ZTE from the Entity List, in April 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a denial order against ZTE. Unless interim relief is provided or ZTE reaches another settlement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, this restriction may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  Additional factors that could adversely affect us due to our international operations include rising oil prices and increased costs, or limited supply of other natural resources. Moreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in the event of political conflicts, economic crises or changes in international relations affecting countries where our main wafer providers, warehouses, end customers and contract manufacturers who provide assembly and test services worldwide, are located. For example, the United Kingdom's pending exit from the European  Union, commonly referred to as "Brexit", has led to significant instability and uncertainty in such regions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, in the first half of 2018, the U.S and China began threatening to impose tariffs on each other's products, leading to fears of a trade war, which, if were to materialize, could result in general economic downturn or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.   
    
  Because we have international business and operations, we are vulnerable to the economic conditions of the countries in which we operate and currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  In addition to our U.S. operations, we also have significant international operations, including foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors, our regional headquarters in Ireland and Singapore and an R D site in India. Sales and operations outside of the U.S. subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business or by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries. We derive more than half of our revenues from international sales, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Japan where economic weaknesses have adversely affected our revenues in the past. Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. While the recent movements of the Euro and Yen exchange rates against the U.S. dollar had no material impact  on our business, increased volatility could impact our European and Japanese customers. Currency instability and volatility and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of our customers and may impair our customers' ability to repay existing obligations. For example, the United Kingdom's 2016 referendum vote to approve, "Brexit", has created economic uncertainty and currency volatility in the European Union. Increased currency volatility could also positively or negatively impact our foreign-currency-denominated costs, assets and liabilities. In addition, any devaluation of the U.S. dollar  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

relative to other foreign currencies may increase the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries adversely affecting our results of operations. Furthermore, because we are increasingly dependent on the global economy, instability in worldwide economic environments occasioned, for example, directly or indirectly by political instability (such as due to Brexit), terrorist activity, U.S. or other military actions, changes to U.S. domestic and foreign policy and international sanctions or other diplomatic actions (potentially including sanctions adopted or under consideration by the U.S. or European Union with respect to Russia or Russian individuals or businesses), could adversely impact economic activity and lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers generally or in specific regions. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.  
    
  We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in credit rating and in the market values of our portfolio investments which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  Our cash, short-term and long-term investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements, changes in credit rating and financial market conditions.  Global credit market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities. The global credit and capital markets may again experience significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability. 
    
  Therefore, there is a risk that we may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market conditions deteriorate or the underlying assets fail to perform as anticipated. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair values of our debt securities was judged to be other than temporary. Furthermore, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or financial market conditions.  
    
  Our failure to protect and defend our IP could impair our ability to compete effectively. 
    
  We rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work and trademark laws to protect our IP. We cannot provide assurance that such IP rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, violated, circumvented or challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted against us patent, copyright or other IP rights to technologies that are important to us. Third parties may attempt to misappropriate our IP through electronic or other means or assert infringement claims against us or parties we have agreed to indemnify. Such assertions by third parties may result in costly litigation, indemnity claims or other legal actions, and we may not prevail in such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms. This could result in the loss of our ability to import and sell our products or require us to pay costly royalties to third parties in connection with sales of our products. Any infringement claim, indemnification claim, or impairment or loss of use of our IP could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party IP.  
    
  In the design and development of new products and product enhancements, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as software development tools and hardware testing tools. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties, including hardware and software tools and products. The design requirements necessary to meet future consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development tools that are available to us. In addition, hardware and software tools and products procured from third parties may contain design or manufacturing defects, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our products. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable or fails to produce designs that meet consumer demands, our business could be adversely affected.  
    
  Any failure of our information technology systems to function properly could result in business disruption. 
    
  We rely in part on various information technology (IT) systems to manage our operations, including, but not limited to, financial reporting, and we regularly evaluate these systems and make changes to improve them as necessary. Consequently, we periodically implement new, or upgrade or enhance existing, operational and IT systems, procedures and controls. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to record and report financial, management, or operational information on a timely and accurate basis. In addition, hardware and software tools and products procured from third parties included in our IT systems could contain design or manufacturing defects, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our IT systems. These systems are also subject to power and telecommunication outages or other general system failures. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties in managing them could result in business disruption.

Cyber-attacks and data breaches could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Security breaches, including cyber-attacks, phishing attacks or attempts to misappropriate or compromise confidential or proprietary information or sabotage enterprise IT systems, are becoming increasingly frequent and more sophisticated. We depend on the uninterrupted operation of our IT systems to manage our operations, store and retrieve business and financial data and facilitate internal communications and communications with customers, subcontractors, suppliers and distribution partners. We experience security incidents of varying degrees on an ongoing basis.  We take steps to detect and investigate any security incidents and prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage networks and systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate protections. These security incidents may involve unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of intellectual property or confidential or proprietary information regarding our business or that of our customers or business partners. We also may be subject to unauthorized access to our IT systems through a security breach or cyber-attack. In the past there have been attempts by third parties to penetrate and/or infect our network and systems with malicious software in an effort to gain access to our network and systems. Recently, several large organizations have been infected by  ransomware,  through which an attacker gains access to the organization s computer files, renders them temporarily inaccessible and threatens to permanently delete them if a cash ransom is not paid by a specified deadline. Third parties may continue to attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our network and systems. The IT systems of our customers, suppliers, and distribution partners and the links between our IT systems and our customers are subject to the same risks as those of our IT systems.  In the event of a security breach, our business and reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to legal and regulatory claims which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  Acquisitions and strategic investments present risks, and we may not realize the goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction. 
    
  In the past, we have acquired technology companies whose products complement our products.  We also have made a number of strategic investments in other technology companies.  We may make similar acquisitions and strategic investments in the future, which present risks, including: 

our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management's attention may be diverted by investment, acquisition, transition or integration activities; 
                
    an acquisition or strategic investment may not further our business strategy as we expected, and we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected; 
                
    our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition; 
                
    we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines; 
                
    we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products, and in general and administrative functions that support such products;  
                
    our strategic investments may not perform as expected, and we may be required to recognize a loss on any or all of our strategic investments; and 
                
    we may experience unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions and strategic investments pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
       
  The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions or strategic investments. 
    
  If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, our stock price could be adversely affected. 
    
  We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may not operate effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness disclosure. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control, if any, could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements and could cause investors to lose confidence and our stock price to drop.

We compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to attract, such personnel would harm us.   
    
  We depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and other technical personnel.  Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain, develop and transition such personnel and attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers.  Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing qualified personnel.  Changes to the U.S. immigration laws may also impact the availability of qualified personnel.  From time to time we have effected restructurings that eliminate a number of positions.  Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and our ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future.  If we are unable to retain or develop existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.   Further, changes to our qualified personnel, including key members of management, may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully assimilate key new hires, or to successfully retain, develop and transition promoted employees, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
    
  Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.  
    
  From time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. The amount of damages alleged in certain legal claims may be significant. Certain other claims involving the Company are not yet resolved, including those that are discussed under "Note 16. Litigation Settlement and Contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid these risks. Entering into settlements may result in payment of significant amounts which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operation results. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against us, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would materially and adversely affect a portion of our business and might materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.  
    
  Our products could have defects which could result in reduced revenues and claims against us. 
    
  We develop complex and evolving products that include both hardware and software. Despite our testing efforts and those of our subcontractors, defects may be discovered in existing or new products. Such defects may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with customers. Subject to certain terms and conditions, we have agreed to compensate certain customers for limited specified costs they actually incur in the event our hardware products experience epidemic failure. As a result, epidemic failure and other performance problems could result in claims against us or the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business. Our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses. 
    
  In addition, we could be subject to product liability claims. A product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly to defend. Product liability risks are particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of these products. Any product liability claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business.

In preparing our financial statements, we make good faith estimates and judgments that may change or turn out to be erroneous.  
    
  In preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must make estimates and judgments in applying our critical accounting policies. Those estimates and judgments have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The most difficult estimates and subjective judgments that we make concern valuation of marketable and non-marketable securities, revenue recognition, inventories, long-lived assets including acquisition-related intangibles, goodwill, taxes and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, input from outside experts and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. If these estimates or their related assumptions change, our operating results for the periods in which we revise our estimates or assumptions could be adversely and materially affected. 
    
  Our failure to comply with the requirements of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR) could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  Our FPGAs and related technologies are subject to EAR, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  In addition, we may, from time to time, receive technical data from third parties that is subject to the ITAR, which are administered by the U.S. Department of State.  EAR and ITAR govern the export and re-export of these FPGAs, the transfer of related technologies, whether in the U.S. or abroad, and the provision of services. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR requirements. 
    
  An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
    
  Our inability to effectively control the sale of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.  
    
  We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors which helps to ensure that products delivered to our customers are authentic and properly handled.  From time to time, customers may purchase products bearing our name from the unauthorized "gray market."   These parts may be counterfeit, salvaged or re-marked parts, or parts that have been altered, mishandled, or damaged.  Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast supply or demand.  Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our authorized distributors may compete with brokers of these discounted products, which can adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our margins.  In addition, our reputation with customers may be negatively impacted when gray market products bearing our name fail or are found to be substandard. 
    
  The conflict minerals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act could result in additional costs and liabilities.   
    
  In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC established disclosure and reporting requirements for companies whose products incorporate "conflict" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, regardless of whether such products are manufactured by those companies or by third parties. These requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our semiconductor products. The costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements include those for due diligence in regard to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  We may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products through the due diligence process we implement. Moreover, some of our customers may require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict-free, and we may be unable to verify the origin of the raw materials used in our products to the extent necessary to make this certification.

Exposure to greater-than-anticipated income tax liabilities, changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could affect our effective tax rates, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including but not limited to changes to our corporate operating structure, intercompany arrangements and tax planning strategies.  
    
  Our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period.  Our future effective tax rates, financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets.  
    
  Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation significantly changed the taxation of U.S.-based multinational corporations, by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and imposing new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. The legislation is unclear in some respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state tax authorities, and the legislation could be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation.  A significant portion of our earnings are earned by our subsidiaries outside the U.S.  Changes to the taxation of certain foreign earnings resulting from the newly enacted U.S. tax legislation, along with the state tax impact of these changes, may have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate.  Furthermore, changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could change our future intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings. The foregoing items could have a material effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition. 
    
  In addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities.  We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Considerable amounts of shares of our common stock are available for issuance under our equity incentive plans, and significant issuances in the future may adversely impact the market price of our common stock.  
    
  As of   March 31, 2018   we had 2.00 billion authorized shares of common stock, of which   253.4 million   shares were outstanding. In addition, 27.7 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans and Amended and Restated 1990 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The availability of substantial amounts of our common stock resulting from the exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity incentive plans, which would be dilutive to existing stockholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.  
    
  We have indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent     us from fulfilling our debt obligations. 
    
  The aggregate amount of our consolidated indebtedness as of    March 31, 2018   was $1.75 billion (principal amount), which consists of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes due 2019 (2019 Notes), $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.000% Notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) and $750.0 million principal amount of our 2.950% senior notes due 2024 (2024 Notes). We also may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness may: 

make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the debentures and our other indebtedness; 
                
    limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; 
                
    limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; 
                
    require us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; 
                
    limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; 
                
    place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and 
                
    increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.

     Table of Contents  

Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. 
    
  The agreements governing the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.   
    
  The indentures governing the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes contain various covenants limiting our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: 

create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries; 
                
    enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property; and 
                
    consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all our assets, taken as a whole, to another person.  
       
  A failure to comply with these covenants and other provisions in these indentures could result in events of default under the indentures, which could permit acceleration of the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes and the 2024 Notes.  Any required repayment as a result of such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

ITEM 7. 
    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
       
  This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
    
  Cautionary Statement 
    
  The statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis that are forward-looking, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including those risks discussed under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this document. Often, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as "anticipates," "believes," "continue," "could," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may," "plans," "projects," "should," "will," "would" and other similar terminology, or the negative of such terms. We disclaim any responsibility to update or revise any forward-looking statement provided in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for any reason. 
    
  Nature of Operations 
    
  We design and develop programmable devices and associated technologies, including ICs in the form of PLDs, software design tools and predefined system functions delivered as IP. In addition to our programmable platforms, we provide design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. Our PLDs include FPGAs, CPLDs and programmable SoCs. These devices are standard products that our customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our products are designed to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as Communication   Data Center, Industrial, Aerospace   Defense, and Broadcast, Consumer   Automotive. We sell our products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to OEMs by selected independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management organization. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our critical accounting policies include: valuation of marketable securities, which impacts losses on debt and equity securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of revenues; and valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of revenues and gross margin. Our critical accounting policies also include: the assessment of impairment of long-lived assets which impacts their valuation; the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, which impacts goodwill impairment; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the provision or benefit recognized for income taxes, as well as, the valuation of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet; and valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation, which impacts gross margin, R D expenses, and selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. 
    
  Valuation of Marketable Securities and Non-marketable Securities 
    
  Our short-term and long-term investments consist of primarily marketable debt, and to a lesser extent equity securities. As of   March 31, 2018  , we had marketable debt and equity securities with a fair value of   $2.18 billion  . 
    
  We determine the fair values for marketable debt and equity securities using industry standard pricing services, data providers and other third-party sources and by internally performing valuation testing and analyses. See "Note 3. Fair Value Measurements" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for details of the valuation methodologies. In determining if and when a decline in value below the adjusted cost of marketable debt and equity securities is other than temporary, we evaluate on an ongoing basis the market conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition, credit ratings, any underlying collateral and other key measures for our investments. We did not record any other-than-temporary impairment for marketable debt or equity securities in fiscal   2018  ,   2017   or   2016  . 

29 

     Table of Contents  

Our investments in non-marketable equity securities of private companies are accounted for by using the cost method. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In determining whether a decline in value of non-marketable equity investments in private companies has occurred and is other than temporary, an assessment is made by considering available evidence, including the general market conditions in the investee s industry, the investee s product development status and subsequent rounds of financing and the related valuation and/or our participation in such financings. We also assess the investee s ability to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee from a prospective acquirer. The valuation methodology for determining the fair value of non-marketable equity securities is based on the factors noted above which require management judgment and are Level 3 inputs. See  Note 3. Fair Value Measurements  to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,  for additional information. When a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, we recognize an impairment loss in the current period s operating results to the extent of the decline. The impairments loss for non-marketable equity securities were not material during all periods presented. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors' end customers (our revenue recognition policy will change starting fiscal 2019, See "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8). For fiscal   2018  , approximately   53%   of our net revenues were from products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the distributor's end customer. Also reported by the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. We maintain system controls to validate distributor data and to verify that the reported information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects the estimated effects of distributor price adjustments and the estimated amount of gross margin expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from us. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from Xilinx at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms. 
    
  As of   March 31, 2018  , we had   $31.8 million   of deferred revenue and   $6.6 million   of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net   $25.2 million   of deferred income on shipments to distributors. As of   April 1, 2017  , we had   $74.2 million   of deferred revenue and   $19.6 million   of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $  54.6 million   of deferred income on shipments to distributors. The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our consolidated statement of income will be different than the amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet due to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors when the product is sold to their end customers. 
    
  Revenue from sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there were no significant formal acceptance provisions with our direct customers. 
    
  Revenue from software licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed. Revenue from software licenses and support services were less than   5%   of net revenues for all of the periods presented. 
    
  Allowances for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending customer returns or allowances. 
    
  Valuation of Inventories 
    
  Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or market (estimated net realizable value). The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory as well as inventory that is not of salable quality. We review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of actual spending over actual volumes. Given the cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, we write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These forecasts are developed based on inputs from our customers, including bookings and extended  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

but uncommitted demand forecasts, and internal analyses such as customer historical purchasing trends and actual and anticipated design wins, as well as market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction. These factors require estimates that may include uncertain elements. The estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecasts, which are also consistent with our short-term manufacturing plans. The differences between our demand forecast and the actual demand in the recent past have not resulted in any material write down in our inventory. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. 
    
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.  
    
  When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Market conditions are amongst the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.  
    
  Long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets, and are only measured at fair value when indicators of impairment exist. 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, and goodwill is written down when it is determined to be impaired. We perform an annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and compare the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired. For purposes of impairment testing, Xilinx operates as a single reporting unit. We use the quoted market price method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on the impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal   2018  , there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal   2018  . Unless there are indicators of impairment, our next impairment review for goodwill will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal   2019  . To date, no impairment indicators have been identified. 
    
  Accounting for Income Taxes 
    
  Xilinx is a multinational corporation operating in multiple tax jurisdictions. We must determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions and apply the appropriate tax rates for these jurisdictions. We undergo routine audits by taxing authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Tax audits often require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates.  
    
  In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Additionally, we must estimate the amount and likelihood of potential losses arising from audits or deficiency notices issued by taxing authorities. The taxing authorities' positions and our assessment can change over time resulting in a material effect on the provision for income taxes in periods when these changes occur.  
    
  We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable.  
    
  We perform a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions relating to accounting for income taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being ultimately realized.

     Table of Contents  

We have recorded provisional estimates associated with the December 22, 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The SEC has provided accounting and reporting guidance that allows us to report provisional amounts within a measurement period up to one year due to the complexities inherent in adopting the changes. As of March 31, 2018, we consider the estimates for the one-time transition tax and for the deferred tax liabilities for U.S. taxes on investments in foreign subsidiaries to be provisional. New guidance from regulators, interpretation of U.S. federal and state laws, and refinement of our estimates from ongoing analysis of data and tax positions may change these provisional amounts. See "Note 14. Income Taxes" to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
    
  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the date of grant requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of rights to purchase shares under our ESPP. Option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model, also require the use of input assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected dividend rate, expected forfeiture rate and expected risk-free rate of return. We use implied volatility based on traded options in the open market as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. We will continue to review our input assumptions and make changes as deemed appropriate depending on new information that becomes available. Higher volatility and expected lives result in a proportional increase to stock-based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk-free rate of return do not have as significant an effect on the calculation of fair value.  
    
  In addition, we developed an estimate of the number of stock-based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate have an effect on reported stock-based compensation, as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. The impact of forfeiture true up was not material for all periods presented. The expense we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and/or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates.

  The following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years indicated: 

Net Revenues 

32 

     Table of Contents  

Net revenues in fiscal   2018   were   $2.54 billion  , an increase of   8%   as compared to fiscal   2017  . Advanced Products revenues increased   28%   in fiscal   2018   but were partially offset by declines from our Core Products. The increase in Advanced Products was due to higher Advanced Products sales across all end markets, especially in Industrial, Aerospace   Defense and Broadcast, Consumer   Automotive. Net revenues in fiscal   2017   were   $2.35 billion  , an increase of   6%   as compared to fiscal   2016  .  Advanced Products revenues increased   45%   in fiscal   2017   but were partially offset by declines from our Core Products. The increase in Advanced Products was due to higher sales across all end markets, especially in Communications   Data Center and Industrial, Aerospace   Defense. See also "Net Revenues by Product" and "Net Revenues by End Markets" below for more information on our product and end market categories. 
    
  No   end customer accounted for more than   10%   of net revenues for any of the periods presented. 
    
  Net Revenues by Product 
    
  We sell our products to global manufacturers of electronic products in end markets such as Communication   Data Center, Industrial, Aerospace   Defense, and Broadcast, Consumer   Automotive. The vast majority of our net revenues are generated from sales of our semiconductor products, but we also generate sales from support products. We classify our product offerings into two categories: Advanced Products and Core Products: 

Advanced Products are our most recent product offerings and include the UltraScale+, UltraScale and 7-series product families. 
                
    Core Products are all other product families. 
       
  These product categories are modified on a periodic basis to better reflect the maturity of the products and advances in technology. The most recent modification was made on April 3, 2016, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2017, whereby we reclassified our product categories to be consistent with how these categories are analyzed and reviewed internally.  Specifically, we have grouped the products manufactured at the 28nm, 20nm and 16nm nodes into a category named Advanced Products while all other products are included in a category named Core Products.  
    
  Net revenues by product categories for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: 

Net revenues from Advanced Products increased significantly in fiscal   2018   as a result of sales growth from our 28nm, 20nm and 16nm product families. Sales from our 28nm products were approximately $900.0 million, while sales from our 20nm and 16nm products exceeded $300.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, during fiscal   2018  .  We expect sales of Advanced Products to continue to grow as more customer programs enter into volume production with our 28nm, 20nm and 16nm products. In fiscal   2017  , growth across all nodes of our Advanced Products families contributed to the strong revenue growth versus the comparable prior year period. 
    
  Net revenues from Core Products decreased in both fiscal   2018   and fiscal   2017   from the comparable prior year periods. The decrease in fiscal   2018   was largely driven by the decline in sales from our Virtex-5, Virtex-6 and Spartan-3 product families, while the decrease in fiscal   2017   was largely due to the decline in sales from our Spartan-3 and Virtex-6 product families.  
    
  Net Revenues by End Markets 
    
  Our end market revenue data is derived from our understanding of our end customers' primary markets. We classify our net revenues by end markets into the following three categories: Communications   Data Center; Industrial, Aerospace   Defense; and Broadcast, Consumer   Automotive. The percentage change calculation in the table below represents the year-to-year dollar change in each end market.

     Table of Contents  

Net revenues by end markets for fiscal years indicated were as follows: 

Net revenues from Communications   Data Center decreased in fiscal   2018  , but increased in fiscal   2017   from the comparable prior year periods.  The decrease in fiscal   2018   was primarily due to lower sales from wireline and wireless. The increase in fiscal   2017   from the comparable prior year period was primarily due to higher sales from wireless, and to a lesser extent from wireline and data center.  
    
  Net revenues from Industrial, Aerospace   Defense increased in fiscal   2018   from the comparable prior year period. The increase in fiscal   2018   was primarily due to higher sales from all sub-segments, primarily aerospace and defense and test and measurement. Net revenues from Industrial, Aerospace   Defense increased in fiscal   2017   from the comparable prior year period. The increase in fiscal   2017   was primarily due to higher sales from test and measurement and aerospace and defense, partially offset by a decrease in sales from industrial, scientific and medical.  
    
  Net revenues from Broadcast, Consumer   Automotive increased in fiscal   2018   and slightly in fiscal   2017   from the comparable prior year periods. The increase in fiscal   2018   was due to higher sales from all sub-segments, primarily consumer. The slight increase in fiscal   2017   was due to higher sales from automotive.  
    
  Net Revenues by Geography 
    
  Geographic revenue information reflects the geographic location of the distributors, OEMs or contract manufacturers who purchased our products. This may differ from the geographic location of the end customers. Net revenues by geography for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: 

Net revenues in North America increased in fiscal   2018   from the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher sales from Aerospace and Defense. Net revenues in North America increased in fiscal   2017   from the comparable prior year period.  The increase was primarily due to higher sales from Test and Measurement.  
    
  Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased in fiscal   2018   from the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher sales from Consumer, and to a lesser extent from Industrial, Scientific and Medical. Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased in fiscal   2017   from the comparable prior year period, which was primarily driven by higher sales from Wireless Communications. 
    
  Net revenues in Europe increased in fiscal   2018   and in fiscal   2017   from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to higher sales from Test and Measurement, partially offset by lower revenues from Wireless Communications.  
    
  Net revenues in Japan increased in fiscal   2018   from the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales in Test and Measurement and Industrial, Scientific and Medical. Net revenues in Japan decreased in fiscal   2017   from the comparable prior year period, which was primarily driven by lower sales in Industrial, Scientific and Medical.

Gross Margin    

Gross margin was slightly higher by 0.3 and 0.2 percentage point in fiscal   2018   and in fiscal   2017  , respectively, from the comparable prior year periods. The slight increases in gross margin for both periods were primarily due to end-market mix, as the percentage of revenue derived from Industrial, Aerospace   Defense (which has relatively higher gross margin) has increased while the percentage of revenue from Communications   Data Center has decreased in the past two years. 
    
  Gross margin may be affected in the future due to multiple factors, including but not limited to those set forth above in "Risk Factors," included in Part I of this Form 10-K, shifts in the mix of customers and products, competitive-pricing pressure, manufacturing-yield issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate any adverse impacts from these factors by continuing to improve yields on our Advanced Products, improve manufacturing efficiencies and improve average selling price management. 
    
  In order to compete effectively, we pass manufacturing cost reductions to our customers in the form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins. Price erosion is common in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product architecture and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost. We have historically been able to offset much of this revenue decline in our mature products with increased revenues from newer products. 

Research and Development 

R D spending increased $38.4 million, or   6%  , during fiscal   2018   from the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation (including stock-based compensation) related to our new product development, partially offset by lower mask and wafer spending. R D spending increased $67.5 million, or   13%  , during fiscal   2017   from the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to higher mask and wafer spending and employee compensation (including stock-based compensation) related to our new product development. 
    
  We plan to continue to selectively invest in R D efforts in areas such as new products and more advanced process development, IP cores and software development environments. We may also consider acquisitions to complement our strategy for technology leadership and engineering resources in critical areas. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative 

SG A expenses increased by $27.1 million or   8%   during fiscal   2018  , and by   $3.5 million   or   1%   during fiscal   2017  , from the comparable prior year periods as we incurred higher employee compensation in both years (including stock based compensation) from higher headcount relating to revenue growth.  
    
  Executive Transition Costs 
    
  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced the transition of our President and Chief Executive Officer position, whereby Moshe Gavrielov resigned from those roles and Victor Peng assumed these roles. Additionally, we also implemented restructuring measures to realign resources and drive overall operating efficiencies, which impacted approximately 60 positions in various geographies and functions worldwide. We recorded total transition charges of $33.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily related to severance pay expenses and other benefits. As of the end of fiscal 2018, there was   $10.4 million   accrual for severance and other benefits that are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal 2019. 
    
  The following table summarizes the transition costs accrual activity for fiscal 2018:

     Table of Contents  

Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles 

The amortization expense decreased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 as compared to prior year periods.  The decreases were due to certain intangibles that were fully amortized in fiscal 2017 and during fiscal 2018. 
    
  Stock-Based Compensation 

The   $30.9 million   and   $10.9 million   increases in stock-based compensation expense for fiscal   2018   and   2017  , respectively, as compared to the prior year periods were primarily related to higher expenses associated with restricted stock units, as we granted more restricted stock units at a higher fair value in the recent years. In addition, during fiscal   2018   we incurred   $16.6 million   of stock-based compensation related to the transition of our President and Chief Executive Officer position. 
    
  Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net 

In fiscal   2018   we had net interest and other income of   $5.4 million   as compared to net interest and other expense of   $8.3 million   in fiscal   2017  . The increase was primarily due to higher interest income from the investment portfolio, and to a lesser extent lower interest expenses from 2024 Notes and its related interest rate swap contracts as compared to the total interest expenses recognized from the 2017 Convertible Notes that matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The decrease in net interest and other expense in fiscal   2017   from the prior year period was primarily due to higher interest income from the investment portfolio as a result of rising interest rate environment. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications including the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the requirement for companies  
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.  Some provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in fiscal 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal 2019. 
  The corporate tax rate reduction was effective as of January 1, 2018.  Since the Company has a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, it is subject to rules relating to transitional tax rates. As a result, our fiscal 2018 federal statutory rate was a blended rate of 31.5%. The change in the statutory tax rate from 35% to 31.5% for our fiscal 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate. 
    
  The difference between the blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 31.5% and our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the one-time transition tax net of the reversal of the related deferred tax liabilities and the beneficial impact of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions as discussed in  Note 14. Income Taxes  to our consolidated financial statements, included in  Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
    
  The difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% and our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions for which no U.S. income tax had been provided, as we intended to permanently reinvest the earnings outside of the U.S. 
    
  The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 from the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the U.S. federal one-time transition tax of $590.2 million, a remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21% in the amount of $25.1 million and a release of reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2017.  The increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of unremitted foreign earnings that had been accrued through fiscal 2017 in the amount of $381.7 million. 
    
  The decrease in effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to fiscal 2017 benefits from the adoption of new accounting guidance with respect to share-based payment accounting and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions upon completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination of fiscal 2012 through 2014. 
  Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations.  As of March 31, 2018, we recognized provisional amounts for the tax effects of the TCJA which were included as components of income tax expense from continuing operations and reflected in the effective tax rates above. We will continue to assess the impact of the recently enacted tax law on our business and our consolidated financial statements. The final impact of the TCJA recorded by us may vary materially from the provisional impact recorded due to a number of uncertainties and factors, including the need for further guidance and clarification of the new law by U.S. federal and state tax authorities and the need for further guidance on the income tax accounting. 
  In addition to the impacts of tax reform on fiscal 2018 previously discussed, the TCJA also establishes new tax laws that will be effective for our fiscal 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) a new provision designed to tax low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries, which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (FTCs) and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations);  (2) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (3) limitations on the deductibility of entertainment expenses; and (4) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability.  While each of these provisions is expected to have an impact on our tax expense for fiscal 2019 and future periods, we expect the tax on low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries to have the most significant impact. 
    
  Because of the complexity of the new tax on low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of ASC 740. Based on recent deliberations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), we will be allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred or (2) recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as low-taxed income in future years.  Our selection of an accounting policy will depend, in part, on analyzing our facts to determine what the impact is expected to be under each method. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity and debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  

common stock and debentures under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital. Additionally, our investments in debt securities are liquid and available for future business needs. 
    
  Fiscal   2018   Compared to Fiscal   2017    
    
  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term and Long-term Investments 
    
  The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments as of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017   totaled   $3.55 billion   and   $3.44 billion  , respectively. As of   March 31, 2018  , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of   $3.45 billion   and working capital of   $3.21 billion  . As of   April 1, 2017  , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were   $3.32 billion   and working capital was   $2.98 billion  . 
    
  As of   March 31, 2018  , we had   $1.45 billion   of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our non-U.S. entities. The recent TCJA that was signed into law on December 22, 2017 subjects U.S. companies to a one-time transition tax on total post-1986 earnings and profits of their foreign subsidiaries. The TCJA also generally allows companies to repatriate these accumulated foreign earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal taxes beginning after December 31, 2017.  Accordingly, substantially all $1.45 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our non-U.S. entities will be available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. The one-time transition tax liability will be payable in eight annual installments, as outlined in "Contractual Obligations" below. See  Note 14. Income Taxes  to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information about the one-time transition tax. 
    
  During fiscal   2018  , our operations generated net positive cash flow of   $820.0 million  , which was   $114.1 million   lower than the   $934.1 million   generated during fiscal   2017  . The positive cash flow from operations generated during fiscal   2018   was primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items and increases in income taxes payable and accrued liabilities. These items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, other assets and decreases in deferred income to shipments to distributors and accounts payable.  
    
  Net cash provided by investing activities was   $948.2 million   during fiscal   2018   as compared to   $494.0 million   in fiscal   2017  . Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal   2018   consisted of   $1.02 billion   of net sales and maturity of available-for-sale securities, which were partially offset by   $49.9 million   of purchases of property, plant and equipment and other intangibles and   $25.9 million   of other investing activities. 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $555.6 million   in fiscal   2018  , as compared to   $965.2 million   in fiscal   2017  . Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal   2018   consisted of   $474.3 million   of payment to repurchase common stock,   $353.1 million   of dividend payments to stockholders and   $457.9 million   of payment for settlement of our $600.0 million principal amount of 2.625% convertible notes issued in June 2010 (2017 Convertible Notes), which were partially offset by   $745.2 million   of proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and   $47.5 million   from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. 
    
  Accounts Receivable 
    
  Accounts receivable increased by   $128.2 million   and days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 53 days at   March 31, 2018   from 38 days at   April 1, 2017  . The accounts receivable were primarily current. The increase was primarily due to timing of customer shipments and collections. 
    
  Inventories 
    
  Inventories increased to   $236.1 million   as of   March 31, 2018   from   $227.0 million   as of   April 1, 2017  , while combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution decreased to 117 days at   March 31, 2018   from 127 days at   April 1, 2017  . We attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product, package and speed configurations in order to keep lead times short and to meet forecasted customer demand as well as address potential supply constraints. Conversely, we also attempt to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements. We continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost. 
    
  Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Intangibles  

38 

     Table of Contents  

During fiscal   2018  , we invested   $49.9 million   in property, plant and equipment and other intangibles, as compared to   $72.1 million   in fiscal   2017  . Primary investments in fiscal   2018   were for machinery and equipment, building improvements, computer equipment and equipment related to the support of our new products development and infrastructures. 
    
  Current Liabilities 
    
  Current liabilities increased to   $937.2 million   at the end of fiscal   2018   from   $897.2 million   at the end of fiscal   2017  . The changes were primarily due to a net increase in our short-term portion of long-term debt, as we reclassified   $499.2 million   of our 2019 Notes to short term and paid   $457.9 million   for conversion of our 2017 Convertible Notes, as well as increases in our income taxes payable and accrued payroll and related liabilities. These increases were partially offset by decreases of   $35.3 million   in other accrued liabilities and   $29.4 million   in deferred income on shipments to distributors. 
    
  Temporary and Stockholders' Equity 
    
  Temporary and stockholders' equity decreased   $178.8 million   during fiscal   2018   from   $2.51 billion   in fiscal   2017   to   $2.33 billion   in fiscal   2018  . The decrease was primarily due to repurchase of common stock of approximately   $474.3 million   and   $353.1 million   of payment of dividends to stockholders. These decreases were partially offset by   $512.4 million   in net income for fiscal   2018   and   $153.8 million   of stock-based compensation. 
    
  Fiscal   2017   Compared to Fiscal   2016    
    
  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term and Long-term Investments 
    
  The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments as of   April 1, 2017   and   April 2, 2016   totaled   $3.44 billion   and $3.56 billion, respectively. As of   April 1, 2017  , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of   $3.32 billion   and working capital of   $2.98 billion  . As of   April 2, 2016  , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.34 billion and working capital was $2.97 billion.  
    
  As of April 1, 2017, we had $2.84 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our non-U.S. entities. From a financial statement perspective, approximately $1.13 billion of the $2.84 billion held by our non-U.S. entities was available for use in the U.S. without accruing additional U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of April 1, 2017. The remaining amount of non-U.S. cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was permanently reinvested and, therefore, no U.S. current or deferred taxes accrued on this amount, which was intended for investment in our operations outside the U.S.  
    
  During fiscal 2017, our operations generated net positive cash flow of   $934.1 million  , which was   $187.8 million   higher than the   $746.3 million   generated during fiscal 2016. The positive cash flow from operations generated during fiscal 2017 was primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items, decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and income taxes payable. These items were partially offset by increases in inventories and other assets. 
    
  Net cash provided by investing activities was   $494.0 million   during fiscal   2017  , as compared to net cash used by investing activities of   $423.9 million   in fiscal   2016  . Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal   2017   consisted of   $587.4 million   of net   proceeds from sales and maturity of available-for-sale securities, which was partially offset by   $72.1 million   for purchases of property, plant and equipment and other intangibles and   $21.4 million   of other investing activities. 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $965.2 million   in fiscal   2017  , as compared to   $711.1 million   in fiscal   2016  . Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal   2017   consisted of   $522.0 million   of cash payment to repurchase of common stock,   $332.5 million   of dividend payments to stockholders and   $142.1 million   of payment for settlement of our 2017 Convertible Notes, which were partially offset by   $32.8 million   of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. 
    
  Accounts Receivable 
    
  Accounts receivable decreased by $63.5 million and DSO decreased to 38 days at   April 1, 2017   from 52 days at   April 2, 2016  . The decrease was primarily due to timing of customer shipments and collections. 
    
  Inventories 
    
  Inventories increased to   $227.0 million   as of   April 1, 2017   from $178.6 million as of   April 2, 2016  , while combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution increased to 127 days at   April 1, 2017   from 109 days at   April 2, 2016  .  We attempt to maintain

  During fiscal   2017  , we invested   $72.1 million   in property, plant and equipment and other intangibles, as compared to   $34.0 million   in fiscal   2016  . Primary investments in fiscal   2017   were for building improvements, computer equipment and equipment related to the support of our new products development and infrastructures. 
    
  Current Liabilities 
    
  Current liabilities decreased to   $897.2 million   at the end of fiscal   2017   from $944.4 million at the end of fiscal   2016  . The change was primarily due to a payment of   $142.1 million   for conversion of our 2017 Convertible Notes, which was partially offset by increases of   $50.0 million   in other accrued liabilities and   $22.3 million   in accrued payroll and related liabilities. 
    
  Temporary and Stockholders' Equity 
    
  Temporary and stockholders' equity decreased $93.7 million during fiscal   2017   from $2.60 billion in fiscal   2016   to $2.51 billion in fiscal   2017  . The decrease was primarily due to repurchase of common stock of approximately $522.0 million, $332.5 million of payment of dividends to stockholders and $18.1 million of other comprehensive loss. These decreases were partially offset by $622.5 million in net income for fiscal   2017  , $122.9 million of stock-based compensation, $32.8 million of net issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash generated from operations is used as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Our investment portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our   $400.0 million   revolving credit facility entered into in December 2016 (expiring in   December 2021  ). We are not aware of any lack of access to the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance that access to the credit facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our credit facility is not reliant upon a single bank. There have been   no   borrowings to date under our existing revolving credit facility. 
    
  We repurchased   7.0 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $474.3 million   during fiscal   2018  . During fiscal   2017  , we repurchased 9.9 million shares of common stock for approximately $522.0 million. During fiscal   2018  , we paid   $353.1 million   in cash dividends to stockholders, representing $1.40 per common share. During fiscal   2017  , we paid   $332.5 million   in cash dividends to stockholders, representing $1.32 per common share. On April 25, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.36 per common share for the   first   quarter of fiscal   2019  . The dividend is payable on June 4, 2018 to stockholders of record as of May 15, 2018. Our common stock and debentures repurchase program and dividend policy could be impacted by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements relating to R D, investments and acquisitions, legal risks, principal and interest payments on our debentures and other strategic investments. 
    
  We anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity, to procure additional capital equipment and facilities, to develop new products, and to potentially acquire technologies or businesses that could complement our business. However, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A and below could affect our cash positions adversely.  
    
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of   March 31, 2018   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable, income taxes payable and other accrued liabilities as of   March 31, 2018  .

(1) 
    We lease some of our facilities, office buildings and land under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through November 2035. Rent expense, net of rental income, under all operating leases was approximately   $3.9 million   for fiscal   2018  . See "Note 8. Commitments" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information about operating leases. 
       
           (2) 
    Due to the nature of our business, we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The lengthy subcontractor lead times require us to order the materials and services in advance, and we are obligated to pay for the materials and services when completed. We expect to receive and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and quality specifications. 
       
           (3) 
    As of   March 31, 2018  , we had   $26.2 million   of non-cancelable license obligations to providers of electronic design automation software and hardware/software maintenance and $13.3 million of other license expiring at various dates through March 2024. 
       
           (4) 
    As of   March 31, 2018  , we had   $28.9 million   commitments primarily related to open purchase orders from ordinary operations.  
       
           (5) 
    For purposes of this table we have assumed the outstanding principal of our debentures will be paid on maturity dates, which is March 15, 2019 for the 2019 Notes, March 15, 2021 for the 2021 Notes and June 1, 2024 for the 2024 Notes. See "Note 12. Debt and Credit Facility" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information about our debentures. 
       
           (6) 
    Tax obligations represent the future cash payments related to the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the TCJA as described in  Note 14. Income Taxes  to our consolidated financial statements, included in  Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.   
       
  As of   March 31, 2018  ,   $523.9 million   of liabilities were classified as long-term income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets. Of the $523.9 million, $512.5 million was the estimated long-term portion of the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the TCJA.  The remaining $11.4 million of the long-term income taxes payable is for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties.  Since the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlements and any future payments related to uncertain tax positions, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. 
    
  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   March 31, 2018  , we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  See "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for information about recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 7A. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately   $2.18 billion   as of   March 31, 2018  . Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio includes, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, student loan auction rate securities, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, bank loans and debt mutual funds. In  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 100 basis-point (one percentage point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017   would have affected the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately   $40.0 million   and   $60.0 million  , respectively. 
    
  Credit Market Risk 
    
  The global credit markets may experience adverse conditions that negatively impact the values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities. The global credit and capital markets may experience significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability. Therefore, there is a risk that we may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market conditions deteriorate. See "Note 4. Financial Instruments" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
    
  Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. 
    
  Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained and the hedged relationship has been effective, are deferred and included in income or expenses in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of income as they are incurred. 
    
  We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our overseas operating expenses and other liabilities when deemed appropriate. As of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , we had the following outstanding forward currency exchange contracts (in notional amount): 

As part of our strategy to reduce volatility of operating expenses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we employ a hedging program with forward outlook of up to two years for major foreign-currency-denominated operating expenses. The outstanding forward currency exchange contracts expire at various dates through   February 2020  . The net unrealized gains, which approximate the fair market value of the forward currency exchange contracts, are expected to be recognized in the consolidated statements of income within the next two years. 
    
  Our investments in several of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated at each quarter end during consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments. These fluctuations are recorded within stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Other monetary foreign-denominated assets and liabilities are revalued on a monthly basis with gains and losses on revaluation reflected in net income. A hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates at   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017   would have affected the annualized foreign-currency-denominated operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by less than $12.0 million for each year. In addition, a hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017   would have affected the value of foreign-currency-denominated cash and investments by less than $7.0 million and $5.0 million as of each date.

The Company is dependent on these foundries to produce and deliver silicon wafers on a timely basis. The Company is also dependent on subcontractors, primarily located in the Asia Pacific region, to provide semiconductor assembly, test and shipment services. Xilinx is a global company with sales offices throughout the world. The Company derives over   one-half   of its revenues from international sales, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Japan. 

Note 2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk 
       
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xilinx and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany transactions. The Company uses a   52  - to   53  -week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal   2018   and   2017   were a 52-week year ended on   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , respectively. Fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year, ended on April 2, 2016. Fiscal   2019   will be a 52-week year ending on   March 30, 2019  .  
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to, among others, the useful lives of assets, assessment of recoverability of property, plant and equipment, long-lived assets and goodwill, inventory write-downs, allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns, deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, potential reserves relating to litigation and tax matters, valuation of certain investments and derivative financial instruments as well as other accruals or reserves. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. 
    
  Cash Equivalents and Investments 
    
  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less. These investments consist of money market funds, non-financial institution securities, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities and financial institution securities. Short-term investments consist of mortgage-backed securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, financial institution securities, asset-back securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, bank loans and debt mutual funds with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year from the balance sheet date. Long-term investments consist of mortgage-backed securities, debt mutual funds and asset-backed securities with remaining maturities greater than one year, unless the investments are specifically identified to fund current operations, in which case they are classified as short-term investments. Equity investments are also classified as long-term investments since they are not intended to fund current operations. 
    
  The Company maintains its cash balances with various banks with high quality ratings, and with investment banking and asset management institutions. The Company manages its liquidity risk by investing in a variety of money market funds, high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, bank time deposits, bank loans and debt mutual funds. This diversification of investments is consistent with its policy to maintain liquidity and ensure the ability to collect principal. The Company maintains an offshore investment portfolio denominated in U.S. dollars. All investments are made pursuant to corporate investment policy guidelines. Investments include Euro commercial paper, Euro dollar bonds, Euro dollar floating rate notes, offshore time deposits, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, bank loans, debt mutual funds and mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies. 
    
  Management classifies investments as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designation at each balance sheet date, although classification is not generally changed. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and the ability to hold the securities until maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are  
  
   48 

     Table of Contents  

carried at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization, as well as any interest on the securities, is included in interest income.   No   investments were classified as held-to-maturity as of   March 31, 2018   or   April 1, 2017  . Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. See "Note 3. Fair Value Measurements" for information relating to the determination of fair value. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are included in interest and other expense, net. In determining if and when a decline in value below the adjusted cost of marketable debt and equity securities is other than temporary, we evaluate on an ongoing basis the market conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition, credit ratings, any underlying collateral and other key measures for our investments. The cost of securities matured or sold is based on the specific identification method. 
    
  In determining whether a decline in value of non-marketable equity investments in private companies is other than temporary, the assessment is made by considering available evidence including the general market conditions in the investee's industry, the investee's product development status, the investee's ability to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee's need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation and bona fide offers to purchase the investee from a prospective acquirer. When a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period's interest and other expense, net, to the extent of the decline. 
    
  Accounts Receivable 
    
  The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on the aging of Xilinx's accounts receivable, historical experience, known troubled accounts, management judgment and other currently available evidence. Xilinx writes off accounts receivable against the allowance when Xilinx determines a balance is uncollectible and no longer actively pursues collection of the receivable. The amounts of accounts receivable written off were insignificant for all periods presented. 
    
  Inventories 
    
  Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method), or market (estimated net realizable value) and are comprised of the following: 

The Company reviews and sets standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. The Company's manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of actual spending over actual volumes. Given the cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, the Company writes down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These forecasts are developed based on inputs from the Company's customers, including bookings and extended but uncommitted demand forecasts, and internal analyses such as customer historical purchasing trends and actual and anticipated design wins, as well as market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction. These factors require estimates that may include uncertain elements. The estimates of future demand that the Company uses in the valuation of inventory are the basis for its published revenue forecasts, which are also consistent with our short-term manufacturing plans. The differences between the Company's demand forecast and the actual demand in the recent past have not resulted in any material write down in the Company's inventory. If the Company's demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and the Company fails to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, the Company could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on the Company's gross margin.

     Table of Contents  

Property, Plant and Equipment 
    
  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets of   three   to   five   years for machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures and   15   to   30   years for buildings. Depreciation expense totaled   $46.4 million  ,   $45.4 million   and   $50.8 million   for fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. 
    
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, Xilinx estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value.  
    
  Goodwill 
    
  Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. Based on the impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal   2018  , there was   no   impairment of goodwill in fiscal   2018  . Unless there are indicators of impairment, the Company's next impairment review for goodwill will be performed and completed in the   fourth   quarter of fiscal   2019  . To date, no impairment indicators have been identified. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors' end customers. For fiscal   2018  , approximately   53%   of the Company's net revenues were from products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the distributor's end customer.  Also reported by the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment information, as well as inventory on hand.  Reported distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. The Company maintains system controls to validate distributor data and to verify that the reported information is accurate.  Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects the estimated effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from the Company.  Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from Xilinx at which point the Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms.  
    
  As of   March 31, 2018  , the Company had   $31.8 million   of deferred revenue and   $6.6 million   of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net   $25.2 million   of deferred income on shipments to distributors.  As of   April 1, 2017  , the Company had   $74.2 million   of deferred revenue and   $19.6 million   of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net   $54.6 million   of deferred income on shipments to distributors.  The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in the Company's consolidated statement of income will be different than the amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet due to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors when the product is sold to their end customers.   
    
  Revenue from sales to the Company's direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations.  For each of the periods presented, there were no significant acceptance provisions with the Company's direct customers.  
    
  Revenue from software licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year.  Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed.  Revenue from software licenses and support services sales were less than   5%   of net revenues for all of the periods presented. 
    
  Allowances for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending customer returns.

     Table of Contents  

Foreign Currency Translation 
    
  The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company's Ireland and Singapore subsidiaries.  Monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into U.S. dollars, and the resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of income under interest and other expense, net.  The remeasurement gains or losses were immaterial for all fiscal periods presented.   
    
  The local currency is the functional currency for each of the Company's other wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries.  Assets and liabilities are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at month-end exchange rates and statements of income are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. Exchange gains or losses arising from translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities (i.e., cumulative translation adjustment) are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  To reduce financial risk, the Company periodically enters into financial arrangements as part of the Company's ongoing asset and liability management activities. Xilinx uses derivative financial instruments to hedge fair values of underlying assets and liabilities or future cash flows which are exposed to interest rate, foreign currency or commodity price fluctuations. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. See "Note 5. Derivative Financial Instruments" for detailed information about the Company's derivative financial instruments. 
    
  Research and Development Expenses 
    
  Research and development costs are current period expenses and charged to expense as incurred. 
    
  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company has equity incentive plans that are more fully discussed in "Note 6. Stock-Based Compensation Plans." The authoritative guidance of accounting for share-based payment requires the Company to measure the cost of all employee equity awards (that are expected to be exercised or vested) based on the grant-date fair value of those awards, and to record that cost as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award (over the vesting period of the award).  Additionally, the Company's ESPP is deemed to be a compensatory plan under the authoritative guidance of accounting for share-based payments.  Accordingly, the ESPP is included in the computation of stock-based compensation expense.  
    
  The Company uses the straight-line attribution method to recognize stock-based compensation costs over the requisite service period of the award.  Upon exercise, cancellation or expiration of stock options, deferred tax assets for options with multiple vesting dates are eliminated for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each award had a separate vesting period. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  All income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method     under the accounting for income taxes, as interpreted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) authoritative guidance for measuring uncertain tax positions  .    Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. 
    
  Product Warranty and Indemnification 
    
  The Company generally sells products with a limited warranty for product quality.  The Company provides an accrual for known product issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.  As of the end of both fiscal   2018   and   2017  , the accrual balance of the product warranty liability was immaterial.  
    
  The Company offers, subject to certain terms and conditions, to indemnify customers and distributors for costs and damages awarded against these parties in the event the Company's hardware products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights or trademarks, and to compensate certain customers for limited specified costs they actually incur in the event our hardware products experience epidemic failure.  To a lesser extent, the Company may from time-to-time offer limited indemnification with respect to its software products.  The terms and conditions of these indemnity obligations are limited by contract, which obligations are typically perpetual from the effective date of the agreement.  The Company has historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these provisions and has not made any significant payments  
  
   51 

     Table of Contents  

pursuant to these provisions.  The Company cannot estimate the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, that the Company may be required to make as a result of these obligations due to the limited history of indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision.  However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not incur any financial liabilities in the future as a result of these obligations. 
    
  Concentrations of Credit Risk 
    
  Avnet, one of the Company's distributors, distributes the Company's products worldwide. As of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , Avnet accounted for   60%   and   59%   of the Company's total net accounts receivable, respectively. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for   43%  ,   44%   and   50%   of the Company's worldwide net revenues in fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. The percentage of net accounts receivable due from Avnet and the percentage of worldwide net revenues from Avnet are consistent with historical patterns. 
    
  Xilinx is subject to concentrations of credit risk primarily in its trade accounts receivable and investments in debt securities to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company attempts to mitigate the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables through its credit evaluation process, collection terms and distributor sales to diverse end customers and through geographical dispersion of sales. Xilinx generally does not require collateral for receivables from its end customers or from distributors. 
    
  No   end customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's worldwide net revenues for any of the periods presented. 
    
  The Company mitigates concentrations of credit risk in its investments in debt securities by currently investing more than   91%   of its portfolio in AA (or its equivalent) or higher grade securities as rated by Standard   Poor's or Moody's Investors Service equivalent. The Company's methods to arrive at investment decisions are not solely based on the rating agencies' credit ratings. Xilinx also performs additional credit due diligence and conducts regular portfolio credit reviews, including a review of counterparty credit risk related to the Company's forward currency exchange contracts. Additionally, Xilinx limits its investments in the debt securities of a single issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating and attempts to further mitigate credit risk by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer. 
    
  As of   March 31, 2018  , approximately   24%   of the portfolio consisted of mortgage-backed securities. All of the mortgage-backed securities in the investment portfolio were issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies and are rated AA+ by Standard   Poor's and Aaa by Moody's Investors Service. 
    
  The global credit markets may experience adverse conditions that negatively impact the values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities. The global credit and capital markets may experience significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability. Therefore, there is a risk that we may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market conditions deteriorate. See "Note 4. Financial Instruments" for a table of the Company's available-for-sale securities. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted 
    
  On February 14, 2018, the FASB issued final guidance that gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings tax effects related to items in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) that were stranded in accumulated OCI as a result of the TCJA. The stranded tax effects result from the change in the federal tax rate for deferred taxes recorded in accumulated OCI. Upon adoption, the standard requires all entities to make new disclosures, regardless of whether they elect to reclassify stranded amounts. The new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the TCJA is recognized or in the period of adoption. The guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company decided to early adopt it in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. As a result, the stranded tax effects in accumulated OCI of   $5.2 million  , primarily related to unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, were reclassified to retained earnings.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  In April 2014, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance, as amended, that outlines a new global revenue recognition standard that replaces virtually all existing U.S. GAAP guidance on contracts with customers and the related other assets and deferred costs.  
  
   52 

     Table of Contents  

The authoritative guidance provides a five-step process for recognizing revenue that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (Full Retrospective), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. The Company will adopt the new guidance beginning in its fiscal 2019, using the Full Retrospective method, and restate the comparative prior periods.  
    
  The most significant impact of the new guidance to the Company relates to recognition of revenue and cost from distributor sales. Under the new guidance, the Company is required to recognize revenue and cost relating to distributor sales upon product delivery (Sell-In), subject to estimated allowance for distributor price adjustments and rights of return, rather than deferring the distributor sales upon product delivery and subsequently recognizing revenue when the product is sold by the distributor to the end customer (Sell-Through). Upon adoption, the Company expects that it will record the cumulative balance of the deferred revenue, adjusted for estimates of distributor price adjustments and returns, and related costs under the Sell-Through method to retained earnings. Consolidated financial statements for the years ended April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018 will be restated in accordance with the new guidance under the Sell-In method.   
    
  The Company has substantially completed its assessment of the new guidance, and implemented changes to its policies and procedures as well as internal controls surrounding such guidance. The adoption of the new guidance has no impact on cash provided by or used in operating, financing, or investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The impact of this new guidance to the Company's fiscal 2018 and 2017 consolidated financial statements is expected as follows: 

Other Pronouncements 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued final authoritative guidance regarding how companies measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method and how they present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are attributable to their own credit. The new authoritative guidance also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of current US GAAP on this matter. The new guidance does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. The authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Upon adoption, the Company would record the ending balance of the unrealized gains or losses as of the end of fiscal 2018 of   $11.0 million   from its investment in mutual funds and equity securities to retained  
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  

earnings, less the applicable deferred tax portion, and subsequent changes in fair value from such investments will be recorded under its consolidated statements of income. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on leases. The new authoritative guidance requires the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and will also require significant additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from leases. Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation. The new authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The new authoritative guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition with application of the new authoritative guidance being the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. To help with the transition to the new guidance, certain practical expedients are provided. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes which eliminates the deferred tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory. As a result, a reporting entity would recognize the tax expense from the sale of an asset in the seller s tax jurisdiction when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation. The new authoritative guidance will be effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the annual period. The authoritative guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019 as the Company decided not to early adopt it in fiscal 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the scope of modification accounting for share-based compensation. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. The new guidance will reduce diversity in practice and result in fewer changes to the terms of an award being accounted for as modifications. The new authoritative guidance will be effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the annual period. The authoritative guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019 as the Company decided not to early adopt it in fiscal 2018. This authoritative guidance does not have material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statement. The Company will continually evaluate the impact of this new authoritative guidance. 
    
  In August 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the accounting for hedging activities. The guidance permits more hedging strategies to be eligible for hedge accounting and simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance in areas where practice issues exist. The new authoritative guidance will be effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim periods after issuance of the authoritative guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3. 
    Fair Value Measurements 
       
  The guidance for fair value measurements established by the FASB defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which Xilinx would transact and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. 
    
  The Company determines the fair value for marketable debt and equity securities using industry standard pricing services, data providers and other third-party sources and by internally performing valuation testing and analysis. The Company primarily uses a consensus price or weighted-average price for its fair value assessment. The Company determines the consensus price using market prices from a variety of industry standard pricing services, data providers, security master files from large financial institutions and other third party sources and uses those multiple prices as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value. The pricing services use multiple inputs to determine market prices, including reportable trades, benchmark yield curves, credit spreads and broker/dealer quotes as well as other industry and economic events. For certain securities with short maturities, such as discount commercial paper and certificates of deposit, the security is accreted from purchase price to face value at maturity. If a subsequent transaction on the same security is observed in the marketplace, the price on the subsequent transaction is used as the current daily market price and the security will be accreted to face value based on the revised price.  

54 

     Table of Contents  

The Company validates the consensus prices by taking random samples from each asset type and corroborating those prices using reported trade activity, benchmark yield curves, binding broker/dealer quotes or other relevant price information. There have not been any changes to the Company's fair value methodology during fiscal   2018   and the Company did not adjust or override any fair value measurements as of   March 31, 2018  . 
    
  Fair Value Hierarchy 
    
  The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. The guidance for fair value measurements requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: 
    
  Level 1   Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
    
  The Company's Level 1 assets consist of U.S. government securities, money market funds and marketable equity securities. 
    
  Level 2   Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
    
  The Company's Level 2 assets consist of financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. agency securities, foreign government and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, debt mutual funds, bank loans, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities also include foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. 
    
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation. 
    
  The Company has no Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
    
  In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The following tables present information about the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  :

Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
    
  The Company's   $500.0 million   principal amount of   2.125%   notes due   March 15, 2019   (2019 Notes),   $500.0 million   principal amount of   3.000%   notes due   March 15, 2021   (2021 Notes) and   $750.0 million   principal amount of   2.950%   senior notes due   June 1, 2024   (2024 Notes) are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes. The fair values of the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes as of   March 31, 2018   were approximately   $496.6 million  ,   $498.9 million   and   $719.7 million  , respectively, based on the last trading price of the respective debentures for the period (classified as Level 2 in fair value hierarchy due to relatively low trading volume).  
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis    
    
  As of   March 31, 2018  , the Company had non-marketable equity securities in private companies of   $36.7 million   (adjusted cost, which approximates fair value). The Company s investments in non-marketable securities of private companies are accounted for by using the cost method. The fair value of the Company s cost method investments is not estimated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of these investments. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In determining whether a decline in value of non-marketable equity investments in private companies has occurred and is other than temporary, an assessment is made by considering available evidence, including the general market conditions in the investee s industry, the investee s product development status and subsequent rounds of financing and the related valuation and/or Xilinx s participation in such financings. The Company also assesses the investee s ability to meet business milestones, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation and bona fide offers to purchase the investee from a prospective acquirer. The valuation methodology for determining the fair value of non-marketable equity securities is based on the factors noted above which require management judgment and are Level 3 inputs. The impairments loss for non-marketable equity securities were not material during all periods presented.

    Financial Instruments 
       
  The following is a summary of cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities as of the end of the periods presented: 

Financial institution securities include securities issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper and time deposits. Substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  .

     Table of Contents  

The following tables show the fair values and gross unrealized losses of the Company's investments, aggregated by investment category, for individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for the length of time specified, as of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  : 

As of   March 31, 2018  , the gross unrealized losses that had been outstanding for less than twelve months were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities due to the general rising of the interest-rate environment, although the percentage of such losses to the total estimated fair value of the mortgage-backed securities was relatively insignificant. The gross unrealized losses that had been outstanding for more than twelve months were primarily related to debt mutual funds and mortgage-backed securities, which were primarily due to the general rising of the interest-rate environment and foreign currency movement.   
    
  The Company reviewed the investment portfolio and determined that the gross unrealized losses on these investments as of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017   were temporary in nature as evidenced by the fluctuations in the gross unrealized losses within the investment categories. These investments are highly rated by the credit rating agencies, there have been no defaults on any of these securities and we have received interest payments as they become due. Therefore, the Company believes that it will be able to collect both principal and interest amounts due to the Company. Additionally, in the past several years a portion of the Company's investment in mortgage-backed securities were redeemed or prepaid by the debtors at par. Furthermore, the aggregate of individual unrealized losses that had been outstanding for twelve months or more was not significant as of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , the majority of which are related to debt mutual funds and mortgage-backed securities due to foreign currency and interest rate

fluctuations. The Company neither intends to sell these investments nor concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that it will have to sell them until recovery of their carrying values.  
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable debt securities (financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities), by contractual maturity, are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties. 

As of   March 31, 2018  ,   $1.16 billion   of marketable debt securities with contractual maturities of greater than one year were classified as short-term investments. Additionally, the above table does not include investments in money market, debt mutual funds and equity securities because these securities do not have specific contractual maturities. 
    
  Certain information related to available-for-sale securities is as follows: 

The cost of securities matured or sold is based on the specific identification method. 

Note 5. 
    Derivative Financial Instruments 
       
  The Company's primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. As a result of the use of derivative financial instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts may fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company manages counterparty credit risk in derivative contracts by reviewing counterparty creditworthiness on a regular basis, establishing collateral requirement and limiting exposure to any single counterparty. The right of set-off that exists with certain transactions enables the Company to net amounts due to and from the counterparty, reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default. 
    
  The Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with certain independent financial institutions to manage interest rate risks related to fixed interest rate expenses from its 2024 Notes and floating interest rate income from its investments in marketable debt securities. See  Note 10. Debt and Credit Facility  for more discussion related to interest rate swap contracts. The interest rate swap contracts were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the 2024 Notes, and were separately accounted for as a derivative. The interest rate swap contracts and the 2024 Notes were initially measured at fair value. Any subsequent changes in fair values of the interest rate swap contracts and the 2024 Notes will be recorded in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. During the nine months ended March 31, 2018, the net change in fair values of the interest rate swap contracts and the underlying 2024 Notes was   $29.0 million  , which was recorded as a derivative liability for the interest rate swap contacts (as a component of other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets) and also a reduction from the carrying amount of 2024 Notes. There was no ineffectiveness during all periods presented. Other than this arrangement, there have been no material changes to the Company's derivative financial instruments since April 1, 2017.

     Table of Contents  

As of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , the Company had the following outstanding forward currency exchange contracts (in notional amount), which were derivative financial instruments: 

As part of the Company's strategy to reduce volatility of operating expenses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the Company employs a hedging program with a forward outlook of up to   two years   for major foreign-currency-denominated operating expenses. The outstanding forward currency exchange contracts expire at various dates through   February 2020  . The net unrealized gains, which approximate the fair market value of the outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, are expected to be recognized in the consolidated statements of income within the next   two years  . 
    
  As of   March 31, 2018  , all of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the gain or loss on the forward contracts was reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into net income in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The estimated amount of such gains or losses as of   March 31, 2018   that is expected to be reclassified into earnings was not material. The ineffective portion of the gains or losses on the forward contracts was included in the net income for all periods presented. 
    
  The Company may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments such as acquisitions and capital expenditures. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained and the hedged relationship has been effective, are deferred and included in income or expenses in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of income as they are incurred. 
    
  The Company had the following derivative instruments as of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , located on the consolidated balance sheet, utilized for risk management purposes detailed above:

Note 6. 
     Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
       
  The Company's equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term retention programs that cover employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company. These plans are intended to attract and retain talented employees, consultants and non-employee directors and to provide such persons with a proprietary interest in the Company. 
    
  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards granted under the Company's equity incentive plans and rights to acquire stock granted under the Company's Amended and Restated 1990 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP): 

The Company adjusts stock-based compensation on a quarterly basis for changes to the estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture experience. The effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization was recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate was changed, and was not material for all periods presented.  
    
  During fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , there were   no   options granted and therefore the Company's stock-based compensation expense related to options, and the number of options outstanding as of   March 31, 2018  , were not material. 
    
  As of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , the ending inventory balances included   $2.1 million   and   $2.2 million   of capitalized stock-based compensation, respectively. During fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , the tax benefit realized for the tax deduction from restricted stock units (RSUs) and other awards totaled   $60.6 million  ,   $53.3 million   and   $56.3 million  , respectively. The tax deduction includes amounts credited to income tax expense in fiscal   2018   and   2017  , and additional paid-in capital in fiscal   2016  . 
    
  The fair values of ESPP were estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company's expected stock price volatility assumption is estimated using implied volatility of the Company's traded options. The expected life of options granted is based on the historical exercise activity as well as the expected disposition of all options outstanding. The expected life of options granted also considers the actual contractual term.

     Table of Contents  

The weighted-average fair value per share of stock purchase rights granted under the ESPP during fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016   were   $17.95  ,   $13.00   and   $11.12  , respectively. These fair values per share were estimated at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions: 

The estimated fair values of RSU awards were calculated based on the market price of Xilinx common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on Xilinx common stock prior to vesting. The per share weighted-average fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016   were   $60.18  ,   $44.38   and   $41.19  , respectively.  The weighted average fair value of RSUs granted in fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016   were calculated based on estimates at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:    

As of   March 31, 2018  , total unrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to ESPP was   $13.9 million  . The total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost for ESPP is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   0.8 years  . 
    
  Equity Incentive Plans 
    
  As of   March 31, 2018  ,   11.3 million   shares are available for future grants under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Equity Plan). The contractual term for stock awards granted under the 2007 Equity Plan is   seven   years from the grant date. Stock awards granted to existing and newly hired employees generally vest over a   four  -year period from the date of grant.

    Commitments 
       
  Xilinx leases some of its facilities and office buildings under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through   April 2029  . Additionally, Xilinx entered into a land lease in conjunction with the Company's building in Singapore, which will expire in   November 2035   and the lease cost was settled in an up-front payment in June 2006. Some of the operating leases for facilities and office buildings require payment of operating costs, including property taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance. Most of the Company's leases contain renewal options for varying terms. Xilinx also leases cars under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through December 2021. Approximate future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows: 

Aggregate future rental income to be received, which includes rents from both owned and leased property, totaled   $9.3 million   as of   March 31, 2018  . Rent expense, net of rental income, under all operating leases was   $3.9 million   for fiscal   2018  ,   $5.0 million   for fiscal   2017  , and   $4.5 million   for fiscal   2016  .

     Net Income Per Common Share 
       
  The computation of basic net income per common share for all periods presented is derived from the information on the consolidated statements of income, and there are no reconciling items in the numerator used to compute diluted net income per common share.  The following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share: 

The total shares used in the denominator of the diluted net income per common share calculation include potentially dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding that are not included in basic net income per common share calculation. The diluted shares were calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the impact of the equity incentive plans, the incremental shares issuable assuming conversion of the Company's   $600.0 million   principal amount of   2.625%   convertible notes issued in June 2010 (2017 Convertible Notes), before its maturity on June 15, 2017, and exercise of warrants on a weighted-average outstanding basis, before the final settlements during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The 2017 Convertible Notes matured during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and the Company exercised its call options to neutralize the dilutive effect of the incremental shares from the 2017 Convertible Notes. Because the number of diluted shares in the above table for the 12 months ended   March 31, 2018   was calculated based on a weighted-average outstanding basis, it included approximately   1.5 million   shares of dilutive impact from the 2017 Convertible Notes through the maturity date and   4.1 million   shares of dilutive impact from warrants before the settlement. See "Note 12. Debt and Credit Facility" for more discussion of the Company's debt, call options and warrants.  
    
  Outstanding stock options and RSUs under the Company's stock award plans to purchase approximately   3.7 million  ,   2.6 million   and   4.6 million   shares, for fiscal   2018  ,   2017   or   2016   respectively, were excluded from diluted net income per common share by applying the treasury stock method, as their inclusion would have been antidilutive. These options and RSUs could be dilutive in the future if the Company's average share price increases and is greater than the combined exercise prices and the unamortized fair values of these options and RSUs.

   2017 Convertible Notes 
    
  During the twelve months ended April 1, 2017, the Company received conversion requests from certain holders of the 2017 Convertible Notes. Upon settlement, the holders received a cash payment equal to the par value of the 2017 Notes converted of   $142.1 million  , as well as   2.5 million   shares of Common Stock. In conjunction with the settlement, the Company exercised the purchased calls and received   2.5 million   shares from the hedge counterparties. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for convertible debentures issued by the FASB, the conversion payment was allocated between the liability (  $142.9 million  ) and equity (  $149.1 million  ) components of the convertible debentures, using the equivalent rate that reflected the borrowing rate for a similar non-convertible debt prior to the conversion. As a result, during fiscal 2017, the Company recognized a loss of   $1.7 million  .  
    
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company received conversion requests from the remaining holders of the 2017 Convertible Notes. Upon settlement, the holders received a cash payment equal to the par value of the 2017 Convertible Notes of   $457.9 million  , as well as   9.0 million   shares of the Company's common stock. In conjunction with the settlement, the Company exercised its call options on its shares of common stock that it purchased to hedge against the dilution from the conversion of the 2017 Convertible Notes, and received   9.0 million   shares from the hedge counterparties. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the 2017 Convertible Notes were   no   longer outstanding.  
    
  The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the 2017 Convertible Notes are reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as follows: 

Prior to the conversion, interest expense related to the 2017 Convertible Notes was included in interest and other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income, and was recognized as follows: 

To reduce the hedging costs of purchasing the call options on its common stock as described above, the Company, under separate transactions, sold warrants to independent counterparties, which gave the counterparties the right to purchase up to   21.1 million   shares of the Company's common stock at   $40.26   per share. All of the warrants were exercised during fiscal 2018 and the Company issued   9.2 million   shares of its common stock for the settlement.

The provision for income taxes consists of the following: 

The domestic and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows: 

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications including the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.  Some provisions of the TCJA began to impact the Company in fiscal 2018, while other provisions will impact the Company beginning in fiscal 2019.  
  The corporate tax rate reduction was effective as of January 1, 2018.  Since the Company has a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, it is subject to rules relating to transitional tax rates. As a result, the Company s fiscal 2018 federal statutory rate was a blended rate of   31.5%  . The change in the statutory tax rate from 35% to   31.5%   for the Company's fiscal 2018 does not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate. 
  In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, the Company has recorded provisional amounts recognizing the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, but will adjust those provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. As of March 31, 2018, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects from the one-time transition tax. The Company recognized a provisional amount of   $208.5 million  , which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. The Company also recognized a provisional deferred tax liability of   $6.2 million   related to future U.S. tax on unremitted foreign earnings, primarily related to state taxes. The Company will continue to assess the impact of the TCJA (and expected further guidance from federal and state tax authorities as well as further guidance for the associated income tax accounting) on its business and consolidated financial statements. 
  The one-time transition tax was based on the Company s total post-1986 earnings and profits (E P) of its foreign subsidiaries.  The Company had previously accrued deferred taxes on a portion of these same earnings.  The larger balance was permanently reinvested outside the U.S.  The Company recorded a provisional U.S. federal amount for its one-time transition tax liabilities, resulting in an increase in income tax expense of   $590.2 million  . This amount reflects  an increase of   $11.3 million   to the provisional  
  
   70 

     Table of Contents  

amount initially recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, the Company released the related U.S. federal deferred tax liabilities, resulting in a decrease in income tax expense of   $381.7 million  .  The net increase to tax expense was   $208.5 million  .  
  The amount recorded for the one-time transition tax remains provisional as the Company has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E P for its foreign subsidiaries.  Additionally, the Company will continue to evaluate the impact of the tax law change as it relates to providing U.S. taxes on its investments in foreign subsidiaries. Since U.S. federal taxes have been recognized through the one-time transition tax on all accumulated and previously untaxed foreign earnings through December 31, 2017, the Company does not intend to permanently reinvest those earnings. 
  As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, U.S. GAAP requires companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment, with resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment.  The Company remeasured deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The amount recorded for the remeasurement and resulting write-down of the Company's deferred tax balance was   $25.1 million  , and its accounting for this effect of TCJA is considered complete under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin 118.  
    
  In accordance with the adoption of authoritative guidance on accounting for share-based payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation of   $21.5 million   and   $15.4 million   in the provision for income taxes during fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation that was recorded in additional paid-in capital in fiscal 2016 was   $11.4 million  . 
    
  As of   March 31, 2018  , the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately   $14.6 million  . If unused, these carryforwards will expire at various dates through fiscal   2036  . All of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to change of ownership limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. The Company had state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately   $177.4 million   as of   March 31, 2018  . The credits have no expiration date. Some of the state credit carryforwards are subject to change of ownership limitations provided by state provisions similar to that of the Internal Revenue Code. The state credit carryforwards include   $128.3 million   that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced by a valuation allowance. 
    
  The provision for income taxes reconciles to the amount derived by applying the federal statutory income tax rate to income before provision for taxes as follows: 

The Company has manufacturing operations in Singapore where the Company has been granted "Pioneer Status" that is effective through fiscal 2021. The Pioneer Status reduces the Company's tax on the majority of Singapore income from   17%   to   zero   percent. The benefits of Pioneer Status in Singapore for fiscal   2018  , fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016   were approximately   $64.1 million   (  $0.25   per diluted share),   $55.9 million   (  $0.21   per diluted share), and   $51.3 million   (  $0.19   per diluted share), respectively. The tax effect of operations in low tax jurisdictions on the Company's overall tax rate is reflected in the table above. 

71 

     Table of Contents  

The major components of deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following: 

Long-term deferred tax assets of   $102.1 million   and   $64.4 million   as of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , respectively, were included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.  
    
  As of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , gross deferred tax assets were offset by valuation allowances of   $101.4 million   and   $72.5 million  , respectively, which were associated with state tax credit carryforwards.  
    
  The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: 

The Company s total gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by   $94.7 million   during fiscal 2018.  The increase was primarily attributable to an additional deduction claimed on federal and state amended tax returns for repurchase premium paid in connection with the early redemption of the Company s 3.125% Junior Convertible debenture due March 15, 2037 (2037 Convertible Notes) in fiscal 2014.   
    
  If the remaining balance of   $125.1 million   and   $30.4 million   of unrecognized tax benefits as of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , respectively, were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of   $15.1 million   and   $8.5 million  , respectively, thereby reducing the effective tax rate.  As of March 31, 2018, another   $85.5 million   related to the 2037 Convertible Notes would increase additional paid-in capital.  
    
  The Company's policy is to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. The balances of accrued interest and penalties recorded in the consolidated balance sheets and the amounts of interest and penalties included in the Company's provisions for income taxes were not material for any period presented.

     Table of Contents  

The statutes of limitations have closed for U.S. federal income tax purposes for years through fiscal 2014, for U.S. state 
  income tax purposes for years through fiscal 2010, and for Ireland income tax purposes for years through fiscal 2012. 
    
  The Company believes its provision for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate for adjustments that may result from tax audits.  However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty.  If any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.  It is reasonably possible that changes to the Company's unrecognized tax benefits could be significant in the next twelve months due to tax audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitation.  As a result of uncertainties regarding tax audits and their possible outcomes, an estimate of the range of increase or decrease that could occur in the next twelve months cannot be made at this time.

  Other Matters  
    
  On June 11, 2015, John P. Neblett, as Chapter 7 Trustee of Valley Forge Composite Technologies, Inc., filed a complaint against Xilinx and others in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (Bankruptcy No. 1:13-bk-05253-JJT). The complaint alleges causes of actions against Xilinx for negligence and civil conspiracy relating to alleged violations of U.S. export laws. It seeks at least   $50.0 million   in damages, together with punitive damages, from the defendants. On September 21, 2015, the action was withdrawn from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.

On November 3, 2015, Xilinx filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11.  On June 27, 2016, the Court denied both motions.  The Company intends to vigorously defend the case and is unable to estimate its range of possible loss, if any, in this matter at this time. 
    
  From time to time, the Company is involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract law, tax, regulatory, distribution arrangements, employee relations and other matters. Periodically, the Company reviews the status of each matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company continues to reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates.

Amortization expense for acquisition-related intangibles for fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016   were   $2.2 million  ,   $5.1 million   and   $6.6 million  , respectively. Based on the carrying value of acquisition-related intangibles recorded as of   March 31, 2018  , and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, the annual amortization expense for acquisition-related intangibles is expected to be as follows: 

Note 18. Employee Benefit Plans 
    
  Xilinx offers various retirement benefit plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees.  Total contributions to these plans were   $14.7 million  ,   $12.9 million   and   $11.0 million   in fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  For employees in the U.S., Xilinx instituted a Company matching program pursuant to which the Company will match contributions to Xilinx's 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan) based on the amount of salary deferral contributions the participant makes to the 401(k) Plan. Xilinx will match up to   50%   of the first   8%   of an employee's compensation that the employee contributed to their 401(k) accounts. The maximum Company contribution per year is   $4,500   per employee. As permitted under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 401(k) Plan allows tax deferred salary deductions for eligible employees.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the 401(k) Plan. Participants in the 401(k) Plan may make salary deferrals of up to   75%   of the eligible annual salary, limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. Participants who have reached the age of   50   before the close of the plan year may be eligible to make catch-up salary deferral contributions, up to   75%   of eligible annual salary, limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.  
    
  The Company allows its U.S.-based officers, director-level employees and its board members to defer a portion of their compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan).  The Compensation Committee administers the Plan. As of   March 31, 2018  , there were   192   participants in the Plan who self-direct their contributions into a menu of hypothetical investment options offered by the Plan that tracks a portfolio of various deemed investment funds.  The Plan does not allow Plan participants to invest directly in Xilinx's stock.  In the event Xilinx becomes insolvent, Plan assets are subject to the claims of the Company's general creditors. There are no Plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or minimum return on investments.  As of   March 31, 2018  , Plan assets of   $95.3 million   were included in other assets within the consolidated balance sheet and obligations of   $103.4 million   were included in accrued payroll and related liabilities. As of   April 1, 2017  , Plan assets were   $81.1 million   and obligations were   $88.1 million  .

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   March 31, 2018  , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of   March 31, 2018  , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated   May 14, 2018   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
  Basis for Opinion  
  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Xilinx, Inc. 
    
  Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  We have audited Xilinx, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of   March 31, 2018  , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Xilinx, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   March 31, 2018  , based on the COSO criteria. 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of   March 31, 2018   and   April 1, 2017  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   March 31, 2018  , and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Part IV, Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated   May 14, 2018   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
    
  Basis for Opinion  
  The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.   
  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9A. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  An evaluation was carried out, under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company's management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended   March 31, 2018   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management's authorization. The design, monitoring and revision of the system of internal control over financial reporting involve, among other things, management's judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. The effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting is supported by the selection, retention and training of qualified personnel and an organizational structure that provides an appropriate division of responsibility and formalized procedures. The system of internal control is periodically reviewed and modified in response to changing conditions. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, no matter how well designed, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect all misstatements or all fraud. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. 
  Management has used the criteria established in the Report "  Internal Control   Integrated Framework"   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 Framework) to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of   March 31, 2018  . 
    
  The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of   March 31, 2018   has been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
