The number of Shares that are subject to the Award and may be earned by you ( Number of Shares ) is set forth below.  All capitalized terms in this Grant Agreement ( Agreement ) that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan.  This Agreement shall include any appendices, addenda or consents attached hereto or otherwise associated herewith.  This Award is subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.  This Agreement is not meant to interpret, extend, or change the Plan in any way, or to represent the full terms of the Plan.  If there is any discrepancy, conflict or omission between this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall apply.

  ***This information is as shown in the Restricted Stock Units section of the third party administrator s online portal. 
    
  Subject to the forfeiture provisions set forth in this Agreement, this Award will vest as to 33 1/3% of the Number of Shares on the First Vesting Date and as to 33 1/3% of the Number of Shares on each of the first and second anniversaries of the First Vesting Date (each a  Vesting Date ), provided you have not Terminated before the respective Vesting Dates.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections 1(b) through 1(d) provide certain circumstances in which you may vest in all or a portion of this Award before the foregoing Vesting Dates.  Any portion of this Award that does not vest, including pursuant to Sections 1(b) through 1(d), shall be cancelled and you will have no further right or claim thereunder. 
    
           1. 
    In the event of your Termination prior to the last Vesting Date, the following provisions will govern the vesting of this Award: 
       
           (a) 
    Termination Generally  :  In the event of your Termination prior to the last Vesting Date for any reason other than as expressly set forth in the other subsections of this Section 1 of the Agreement, this Award immediately will stop vesting and will terminate, and you will have no further right or claim to anything under this Award (other than with respect to the portion of the Award that has previously vested). 
       
           (b) 
    Termination due to Retirement  :  In the event of your Termination prior to the last Vesting Date due to your Retirement, you will vest in a pro-rata portion of the Number of Shares, to be calculated as follows: divide your number of full months of service since the Date of Grant by thirty-six (36) months, multiply that quotient by the Number of Shares, then subtract any Shares in which you already have vested, and round down to the nearest whole Share, and the Vesting Date under this Agreement will be your Termination Date.  For purposes of this Award,  Retirement  means the Termination of your employment with the Company after you have reached age fifty-five (55) and completed ten (10) full years of service with the Company (including any parent or Subsidiary).

For purposes of this Award,  Disability  is defined in Section 30(j) of the Plan. 
       
           (d) 
    Termination On or Within One Year Following Corporate Transaction  :  In the event of your Termination by the Company or its successor on or within one year following the date of a Corporate Transaction and prior to the final Vesting Date, you will vest in a pro-rata portion of the Number of Shares, to be calculated as follows: divide your number of full months of service since the Date of Grant by thirty-six (36) months, multiply that quotient by the Number of Shares, then subtract any Shares in which you already have vested, and round down to the nearest  
     
   1

           (e) 
    For purposes of this Agreement, your Termination will be deemed to occur on the Termination Date, as defined in the Plan. 
       
           2. 
    Issuance of Shares under this Award  :  Subject to Section 4 of the Agreement, the Company will issue you the Shares subject to this Award as soon as reasonably possible after any Vesting Date or any other date upon which this Award vests under Sections 1(a) through 1(d) (but, to the extent that Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) is applicable to you, in no case later than March 15   th    of the calendar year after the calendar year in which the vesting event occurs).  Until the date the Shares are issued to you, you will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company.  You acknowledge and agree that you may be required to provide a written or electronic acknowledgement prior to the issuance of any Shares to you by the Company under this Agreement. 
       
           3. 
    Rights as a Stockholder; Dividend Equivalent Rights  :  You shall have no voting or other rights as a stockholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Award until such Shares have been issued to you.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, you shall be entitled to receive payment of the equivalent of any and all dividends declared by the Company on its Common Stock on each date on which dividends are paid on and after the Date of Grant of the Award in an amount equal to the amount of such dividends multiplied by the number of Shares underlying the then outstanding portion of the Award.  These dividend equivalents shall be paid upon the later of (a) the date dividends are paid to the common stockholders of the Company, or (b) the date the Restricted Stock Units with respect to which such dividend equivalents are payable become vested and the underlying Shares are issued (it being understood that no dividend equivalents will be paid with respect to Shares underlying any Restricted Stock Units that do not vest, but that dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividends declared on the Company s Common Stock from and after the Date of Grant of the unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be paid as and when such Restricted Stock Units vest and the underlying Shares are issued). 
       
           4. 
    Withholding Taxes  :  If you are subject to United States federal income and employment taxes, this Award is generally taxable upon vesting based on the Fair Market Value on the date the Award (or portion thereof) vests.  For further detail, and for information regarding taxation in other jurisdictions, you should refer to the Global Supplement, which is an attachment to and is incorporated by reference into this Agreement.  To the extent required by applicable law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, employment tax, social security tax, social insurance, payroll tax, contributions, payment on account or other withholding obligations that arise under this Award and, if applicable, any sale of Shares.  The Company shall not be required to issue Shares pursuant to this Award or to recognize any purported transfer of Shares until such obligations are satisfied.  Subject to the Company s discretion and in compliance with applicable laws, these obligations may be satisfied by the Company withholding a number of Shares that would otherwise be issued under this Award that the Company determines has a Fair Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations (determined using a rate of up to the maximum statutory rate in the applicable jurisdictions), including but not limited to withholding with respect to income and/or employment taxes on this Award, including any stock-settled dividend equivalent rights paid with respect to any Shares underlying this Award.  Subject to the Company s discretion and in compliance with applicable laws, these obligations may also be satisfied by other methods including, but not limited to: (a) through a  same day sale  commitment from you and a FINRA Dealer meeting the requirements of the Company s  same day sale  procedures, (b) having the Company withhold amounts from amounts otherwise payable to you under the Company s payroll system, and (c) any other methods approved by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Section 16 Officer of the Company, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and you, these obligations will be satisfied by the Company withholding a number of Shares that would otherwise be issued under this Award that the Company determines has a Fair Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations (determined as the minimum statutory rate in the applicable jurisdictions), including but not limited to withholding with respect to income and/or employment taxes on this Award, including any stock-settled dividend equivalent rights paid with respect to any Shares underlying this Award.  For purposes of this Award,  Fair Market Value  is defined in Section 30(m) of the Plan. 
       
  You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with this Award, regardless of any action the Company takes or any transaction pursuant to this section with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with this Award.  The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of this Award or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares underlying the Award that vest.  The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure this Award to reduce or eliminate your tax liability or to ensure that the tax withholding is sufficient to entirely satisfy your tax liability arising from this Award.

5. 
    Disputes  :  Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, any adjustments to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with its authority under Section 4 of the Plan.  Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding. 
       
           6. 
    Other Matters  : 
       
           (a) 
    The Award granted to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Company or any Subsidiary or other affiliate of the Company to grant an award in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Company (or any Subsidiary or other affiliate) might grant an award in any future year or in any given amount.  Decisions regarding any future grants of an award, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee. 
       
           (b 
    As the grant of the Award is discretionary, the grant does not form part of your contract of employment.  If you are employed by any Company in the group other than the Company, the grant of the Award will not form a contractual relationship between you and the Company and will not form part of your contract of employment with the Subsidiary which employs you. 
       
           (c) 
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if you change classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee, the Company may make unilateral changes to the terms and conditions of this Award, including reducing the number of Shares subject to this Award, in accordance with Company policy. 
       
           (d) 
    This Award is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation for services that you have rendered to the Company or any Subsidiaries (including, as applicable, your employer).  Further, this Award is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, payment in lieu of notice, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments. 
       
           (e) 
    Your participation in the Plan is voluntary.  The Company, and its officers or directors, do not guarantee or make any representation to you regarding the performance of the Common Stock.  The future value of the Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with any certainty. 
       
           (f) 
    Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued Shares and the Company is a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions.  You acknowledge and agree that any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Award granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in Santa Clara County in the State of California. 
       
           (g) 
    Communications regarding the Plan and this Award may be made by electronic delivery through an online or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.  You hereby acknowledge that you have read this provision and consent to the electronic delivery of the documents. 
       
           (h) 
    You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, your employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. 
       
           (i) 
    You understand that your employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, collect and hold certain personal information about you regarding your employment, the nature and amount of your compensation and the fact and conditions of your participation in the Plan, including, but not limited to, your name, gender, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, tax file number, social security number or other identification number, salary, tax information, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company and its Subsidiaries, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor and other personal data reasonably required for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan (the  Data ).  For more information about your employer s collection and processing of your Data for this purpose, please see Intuit s Global Employee Privacy Policy, which can be found on the Company s Intranet or by contacting your local human resources representative. 
       
           (j) 
    Data Transfer for Administration of Plan. 

3 

(i) 
    You understand that Data may be transferred to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC at 2000 Westchester Avenue, Purchase, NY 10577 to assist with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan.  You understand that this recipient may act as a Data Controller under applicable privacy laws and consent that Morgan Stanley may receive, possess, use, retain, and transfer Data to provide support and organizational and technical services to implement, manage, and administer the Plan.  Morgan Stanley may be located in the United States or in other countries with different data privacy laws and a lower level of data privacy protections than in your country.  Your employer and the Company will implement appropriate measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of Data transferred.  You have the right to withdraw consent at any time with future effect. 
       
           (ii) 
    You understand that the Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan or as required by applicable laws.  You understand that your consent is voluntary and that you may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein with future effect, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative.  Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal. 
       
           (iii) 
    You understand, however, that while refusing or withdrawing your consent will not have a negative impact on your employment, it may affect your ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative. 
       
           (iv) 
    If you are located in the European Union, your employer and the Company process and transfer Data to Morgan Stanley on the legal basis of: (i) your consent where required under applicable law; (ii) entering into a contract with you and performing our obligations pursuant to such contract. 
       
  If you are an employee outside the United States, you will be asked to consent to this data transfer for implementation, administration and management of the Plan separately on the third party administrator s website when you accept your Award. 
    
           (k) 
    This Agreement, and any issuance of Shares hereunder, is intended to comply and shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.  Upon your Separation from Service, the Company shall determine whether any Shares issued to you in accordance with this Agreement could be determined to be payments from a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and whether you are a  specified employee  as of the applicable payment date (each as defined by Section 409A of the Code).  If you are determined to be a  specified employee  and any such payments are payable in connection with your Separation from Service, and are not exempt from Section 409A of the Code as a short-term deferral or otherwise, these payments, to the extent otherwise payable within six (6) months after your date of Separation from Service, will be paid in a lump sum on the earlier of: (i) the date that is six (6) months after your date of Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death.  The foregoing six (6) month delay shall be applied if and only to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A of the Code.  For purposes of this Agreement, a  Separation from Service  means an anticipated permanent reduction in the level of bona fide services to twenty percent (20%) or less of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding thirty-six (36) month period.  For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the payments to be made to you in accordance with this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. 
       
           7. 
    Miscellaneous  :  This Agreement (including the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to this Award, and supersedes all prior agreements or promises with respect to the Award.  Except as provided in the Plan, this Agreement may be amended only by a written document signed by the Company and you.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Company may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of the Company.  Subject to the restrictions on transfer of an Award described in Section 14 of the Plan, this Agreement shall be binding on your permitted successors and assigns (including heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives).  All notices required under this Agreement or the Plan must be mailed or hand-delivered, (1) in the case of the Company, to the Company, attn.: Stock Administration at 2535 Garcia Ave., Mountain View, CA 94043, or at such other address designated in writing by the Company to you, and (2) in the case of you, at the address recorded in the books and records of the Company as your then current home address.  You acknowledge and agree that any such notices from the Company to you may also be delivered through the Company s electronic mail system (prior to your Termination Date) or at the last email address you provided to the Company (after your Termination Date).

  INTUIT INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2005 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN GRANT AGREEMENT  Restricted Stock Unit   (Performance-Based Vesting with Relative Total Shareholder Return Goals: CEO) 
  Intuit Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Intuit  or the  Company ), hereby grants you a restricted stock unit award ( Award ) pursuant to the Company s Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), of the Company s common stock, $0.01 par value per share ( Common Stock  or  Shares ).  The maximum number of Shares that are subject to the Award and may become eligible to vest ( Maximum Shares ) is set forth below.  All capitalized terms in this Grant Agreement ( Agreement ) that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan.  This Agreement shall include any appendices, addenda or consents attached hereto or otherwise associated herewith.  This Award is subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.  This Agreement is not meant to interpret, extend, or change the Plan in any way, or to represent the full terms of the Plan.  If there is any discrepancy, conflict or omission between this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall apply. 
    
  Name of Participant:     
  Address:     
  Maximum Shares:   [___] total (200% of the Target Shares) 
  Target Shares:   [___] total ([___] (one-third of the total number of Target Shares) for each of the three overlapping Performance Periods) 
  Date of Grant:         
  Vesting Date:     
    
  ***This information is as shown in the Restricted Stock Units section of the third party administrator s online portal. 
    
  Vesting Based on Achievement of Total Shareholder Return Goals  .  Subject to the service conditions included in this Agreement, vesting of this Award is based on Intuit s percentile rank of total shareholder return ( TSR ) among a group of comparator companies (the  Comparison Group ), as set forth on   Exhibit A   (the  TSR Goals ).  Actual performance against the TSR Goals is measured as follows: up to one-third of the Maximum Shares will be eligible to vest based on the actual performance against the TSR Goals as measured over the period beginning on August 1, [year] and ending on July 31, [year] (the  12 Month Performance Period ), up to one-third of the Maximum Shares will be eligible to vest based on the actual performance against the TSR Goals as measured over the period beginning on August 1, [year] and ending on July 31, [year] (the  24 Month Performance Period ), and up to one-third of the Maximum Shares will be eligible to be vest based on the actual performance against the TSR Goals as measured over the period beginning on August 1, [year] and ending on July 31, [year] (the  36 Month Performance Period  and together with the 12 Month Performance Period and the 24 Month Performance Period, the  Performance Periods  and each a  Performance Period ).  The actual performance against the TSR Goals for each Performance Period must be certified by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of Intuit s Board of Directors ( Committee ) in order for any portion of this Award to be eligible to vest;   provided  ,   however  , that if Intuit s TSR is negative during a Performance Period, then the maximum Shares that the Committee can certify as eligible to vest for that Performance Period will be the Target Shares for that Performance Period.  The Committee will certify the results of the TSR Goals as soon as reasonably possible (the date of such certification for the respective Performance Period, the  Certification Date ) after each Performance Period.  Any portion of this Award that is eligible to vest based on the Committee s certification will be subject to continued service through the Vesting Date in order to become fully vested.  For avoidance of doubt, you must remain in continued service with Intuit through and including the Vesting Date in order to become vested in any portion of the Award that becomes eligible to vest based on the Committee s certification.  Any portion of this Award that is not eligible to vest based on the Committee s certification for the applicable Performance Period will terminate on the Certification Date of the respective Performance Period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections 1(b) through 1(e) provide certain circumstances in which you may vest in this Award before the Vesting Date and/or without certification of the TSR Goals by the Committee.  If any of Sections 1(b) through 1(e) apply, then any portion of this Award that does not vest pursuant to those sections will terminate. 
    
  Comparison Group  .  The Comparison Group will be the companies shown on   Exhibit B   (each, together with Intuit, a  Member Company  provided, however, that a company will be removed from the Comparison Group if, during a Performance Period, it ceases to have a class of equity securities that is both registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and actively traded on a U.S. public securities market (unless such cessation of such listing is due to any of the circumstances in (i) through (iv) of the following paragraph). 
    
  Definition of TSR  .   TSR  as applied to any Member Company means stock price appreciation from the beginning to the end of the applicable Performance Period, plus dividends and distributions made or declared (assuming such dividends or distributions are reinvested in the common stock of the Member Company) during such Performance Period, expressed as a  
  
   6 

percentage return.  Except as modified in Section 1(e), for purposes of computing TSR, the stock price at the beginning of a Performance Period will be the average price of a share of common stock of a Member Company over the 30 trading days beginning on August 1, [year], and the stock price at the end of the Performance Period will be the average price of a share of common stock of a Member Company over the 30 trading days ending (i) July 31, [year], for the 12 Month Performance Period, (ii) July 31, [year], for the 24 Month Performance Period, and (iii) July 31, [year] for the 36 Month Performance Period, adjusted for stock splits or similar changes in capital structure; provided, however, that TSR for a Member Company will be negative one hundred percent (-100%) if the Member Company: (i) files for bankruptcy, reorganization, or liquidation under any chapter of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; (ii) is the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding that is not dismissed within 30 days; (iii) is the subject of a stockholder approved plan of liquidation or dissolution; or (iv) ceases to conduct substantial business operations.  For avoidance of doubt, the acquisition of a Member Company by another person or group of related persons by itself does not result in the Member Company being treated as ceasing to conduct substantial business operations. 
    
  1.    In the event of your Termination prior to the Vesting Date, the following provisions will govern the vesting of this Award: 
    
  (a)     Termination Generally  :  In the event of your Termination prior to the Vesting Date for any reason other than as expressly set forth in the other subsections of this Section 1 of the Agreement, this Award will terminate without having vested as to any of the Shares and you will have no right or claim to anything under this Award. 
    
  (b)     Termination due to Retirement  :  In the event of your Termination prior to the Vesting Date due to your Retirement, you will vest immediately on the date of your Retirement in a pro-rata portion of the Award, to be calculated as follows: divide your number of full months of service since the Date of Grant by thirty-six (36) months, multiply this quotient (the  pro rata percentage ) by the sum of (i) the number of Shares that were to vest on the Vesting Date, subject to your continued employment, based on the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, for each completed Performance Period, and (ii) 100% of the Target Shares that remain subject to any incomplete Performance Period, and round down to the nearest whole Share.  The Vesting Date under this Agreement will be your Termination Date.  Subject to Section 6(k), Shares that become vested in accordance with this Section 1(b) will be distributed to you as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of your Retirement.  For purposes of this Award,  Retirement  means the Termination of your employment with the Company after you have reached age fifty-five (55) and completed ten (10) full years of service with the Company (including any parent or Subsidiary).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time of your Retirement you will be a  covered employee  within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), then the number of Shares in which you shall vest with respect to any incomplete Performance Period shall be based on the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, after applying the pro rata percentage and rounding down to the nearest whole share, and such Shares will be distributed to you at the same time as other Participants after the Vesting Date. 
    
  (c)     Termination due to Death or Disability  :  In the event of your Termination prior to the Vesting Date due to your death or Disability after you have been actively employed by the Company for one year or more, this Award will vest immediately as to the sum of (i) the number of Shares that were to vest on the Vesting Date, assuming that you had continued employment until the Vesting Date, based on the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, for each completed Performance Period, and (ii) 100% of the Target Shares that remain subject to any incomplete Performance Period.  The Vesting Date under this Agreement will be your Termination Date.  Shares that become vested in accordance with this Section 1(c) will be distributed to you as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of your Termination due to your death or Disability.  For purposes of this Award,  Disability  is defined in Section 30(j) of the Plan. 
    
  (d)     Involuntary Termination  :  In the event of your Involuntary Termination before the Vesting Date, a pro rata portion of this Award will vest immediately on your Termination Date by applying the pro rata percentage to the sum of (i) the number of Shares that were to vest on the Vesting Date, assuming that you had continued employment until the Vesting Date, based on the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, for each completed Performance Period, and (ii) 100% of the Target Shares that remain subject to any incomplete Performance Period, and rounding down to the nearest whole Share.  Subject to Section 6(k), Shares that become vested in accordance with this Section 1(d) will be distributed to you as soon as reasonably possible after the effective date of a waiver and general release of claims executed by you in favor of the Company and certain related persons determined by the Company in the form presented by the Company ( Release ).  If you do not execute the Release within forty-five (45) days following your Termination Date or such longer period of time as may be required under applicable law, then you will not be entitled to the receipt of any Shares under this Section 1(d).  If the time period to execute and/or revoke the Release spans two calendar years, then, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Shares to be distributed to you pursuant to this Section 1(d) will not be  
  
   7 

distributed to you until the second calendar year.  Involuntary Termination means, for purposes of this Agreement, either (A) your Termination by the Company without Cause, or (B) your resignation for Good Reason.   Cause  means, for purposes of this Agreement, (i) gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of your duties to the Company (other than as a result of a Disability) that has resulted or is likely to result in material damage to the Company, after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board of Directors which specifically identifies the manner in which you have not substantially performed your duties and you have been provided with a reasonable opportunity of not less than 30 days to cure any alleged gross negligence or willful misconduct; (ii) commission of any act of fraud with respect to the Company; or (iii) conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude.  No act or failure to act by you will be considered  willful  if done or omitted by you in good faith with reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.   Good Reason  means, for the purposes of this Agreement, your resignation within sixty (60) days after the occurrence any of the following events without your consent: (i) a material reduction in your duties that is inconsistent with your position at the time of the Date of Grant, (ii) any material reduction in your base annual salary or target annual bonus (other than in connection with a general decrease in the base salaries or target bonuses for all officers of Intuit), or (iii) a requirement by Intuit that you relocate your principal office to a facility more than 50 miles from your principal office on the Date of Grant; provided however, that with regard to (i) through (iii) you must provide Intuit with written notice of the event allegedly constituting  Good Reason,  and Intuit will have 15 days from the date it receives such written notice to cure such event.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1(d) to the contrary, if you will be a  covered employee  under Section 162(m)(3) of the Code on the date of your Involuntary Termination, then your Award will not be treated as described above in this Section 1(d), but instead, you shall vest in a pro rata portion of this Award, calculated by applying the pro rata percentage to the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, and rounding down to the nearest whole Share.  Shares will be distributed to you at the same time as other Participants after the Vesting Date, provided that the Release has become effective.  If you do not execute the Release before the time that Shares are distributed to other Participants,  then Shares will be distributed to you at the time the Release has become effective, provided that the Release becomes effective during the time period provided in this Section 1(d). 
    
  (e)     Corporate Transaction  :  In the event of a Corporate Transaction before the Vesting Date, the level of achievement of the TSR Goals will be based on the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, for each completed Performance Period and will be determined as of the effective date of the Corporate Transaction based on the Comparison Group as constituted on such date (the  CIC Achievement Level ) for any incomplete Performance Period.  In addition, for any incomplete Performance Period, Intuit s ending stock price will be the sale price of the Shares in the Corporate Transaction and the ending stock price of the other Member Companies will be the average price of a share of common stock of a Member Company over the 30 trading days ending on the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, in each case adjusted for changes in capital structure.  This Award will vest immediately prior to the consummation of such Corporate Transaction based on the CIC Achievement Level.  Shares that become vested in accordance with this Section 1(e) will be distributed as soon as reasonably possible after such determinations are complete.  For avoidance of doubt, with respect to any incomplete Performance Period, this provision is intended to result in you vesting in the number of Shares corresponding to the CIC Achievement Level, without Committee certification, provided that you are employed immediately prior to the consummation of a Corporate Transaction.  For purposes of this Award,  Corporate Transaction  is defined in Section 30(i) of the Plan; provided such Corporate Transaction constitutes a  change in the ownership or effective control  of the Company or  change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets  of the Company within the meaning of Treasury Regulations 1.409A-3(a)(5) and 1.409A-3(i) ( 409A Change in Control ). 
    
  (f)  For purposes of this Agreement, your Termination will be deemed to occur on the Termination Date, as defined in the Plan. 
    
  2.      Automatic Deferral; Issuance of Shares under this Award  :  Subject to Section 4 of the Agreement, payment of the Award through the issuance of Shares that become vested as of the Vesting Date shall be automatically deferred until the earliest of: (a) the date that is one year following the Vesting Date; (b) Termination described in Section 1(c) above; or (c) the occurrence of a 409A Change in Control (the earliest such date, the  Settlement Date ).  For avoidance of doubt, the occurrence of a Corporate Transaction following the Vesting Date that is not a 409A Change in Control will not trigger the issuance of Shares prior to the date that is one year following the Vesting Date.  Subject to Section 6(k), in the event of a Termination pursuant to Sections 1(b) through 1(d) prior to the Vesting Date (other than with respect to a  covered employee  under Sections 1(b) or 1(d)), Shares will be distributed as soon as reasonably possible after the Termination Date or, if later, the date that the Release becomes effective in accordance with Section 1(d) (but, to the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to you, in no case later than March 15   th    of the calendar year after the calendar year in which  
  
   8 

the Termination Date or the effective date of the Release occurs).  In addition, upon the occurrence of an event described in Sections 1(b) through 1(d) after the Vesting Date, any Shares that previously became vested on the Vesting Date but have not yet been issued to you shall be issued by the Company as soon as reasonably possible after the occurrence of the event described in Sections 1(b) through 1(d), but in any event in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, including the provisions of Section 6(k) below.  Until the date the Shares are issued to you, you will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company.  You acknowledge and agree that you may be required to provide a written or electronic acknowledgement prior to the issuance of any Shares to you by the Company under this Agreement.  All issuances of Shares will be subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon your Termination by the Company for Cause, any portion of the Award that has not been previously settled will terminate, be forfeited, and you will have no further right or claim to anything under this Award. 
    
  3.      Rights as a Stockholder; Dividend Equivalent Rights  :  You shall have no voting or other rights as a stockholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Award until such Shares have been issued to you.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, you shall be entitled to receive payment of the equivalent of any and all dividends declared by the Company on its Common Stock on each date on which dividends are paid on and after the Date of Grant of the Award in an amount equal to the amount of such dividends multiplied by the number of Shares underlying the then outstanding portion of the Award.  These dividend equivalents shall be paid upon the later of (a) the date dividends are paid to the common stockholders of the Company, or (b) the date the Restricted Stock Units with respect to which such dividend equivalents are payable become vested and the underlying Shares are issued (it being understood that no dividend equivalents will be paid with respect to Shares underlying any Restricted Stock Units that do not vest, but that dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividends declared on the Company s Common Stock from and after the Date of Grant of the unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be paid as and when such Restricted Stock Units vest and the underlying Shares are issued). 
    
           4. 
    Withholding Taxes  :  If you are subject to United States federal income and employment taxes, this Award is generally taxable upon vesting based on the Fair Market Value on the Settlement Date; provided that this Award may become taxable for purposes of employment taxes upon vesting, if earlier than a Settlement Date.  For further detail, and for information regarding taxation in other jurisdictions, you should refer to the Global Supplement, which is an attachment to and is incorporated by reference into this Agreement.  To the extent required by applicable law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, employment tax, social security tax, social insurance, payroll tax, contributions, payment on account or other withholding obligations that arise under this Award and, if applicable, any sale of Shares.  The Company shall not be required to issue Shares pursuant to this Award or to recognize any purported transfer of Shares until such obligations are satisfied.  Subject to the Company s discretion and in compliance with applicable laws, these obligations may be satisfied by the Company withholding a number of Shares that would otherwise be issued under this Award that the Company determines has a Fair Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations (determined using a rate of up to the maximum statutory rate in the applicable jurisdictions), including but not limited to withholding with respect to income and/or employment taxes on this Award, including any stock-settled dividend equivalent rights paid with respect to any Shares underlying this Award.  Subject to the Company s discretion and in compliance with applicable laws, these obligations may also be satisfied by other methods including, but not limited to: (a) through a  same day sale  commitment from you and a FINRA Dealer meeting the requirements of the Company s  same day sale  procedures, (b) having the Company withhold amounts from amounts otherwise payable to you under the Company s payroll system, and (c) any other methods approved by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, since you are a Section 16 Officer of the Company, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and you, these obligations will be satisfied by the Company withholding a number of Shares that would otherwise be issued under this Award that the Company determines has a Fair Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations (determined as the minimum statutory rate in the applicable jurisdictions), including but not limited to withholding with respect to income and/or employment taxes on this Award, including any stock-settled dividend equivalent rights paid with respect to any Shares underlying this Award.  For purposes of this Award,  Fair Market Value  is defined in Section 30(m) of the Plan. 
       
  You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with this Award, regardless of any action the Company takes or any transaction pursuant to this section with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with this Award.  The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of this Award or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares underlying the Award.  The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure this Award to reduce or eliminate your tax liability or to ensure that the tax withholding is sufficient to entirely satisfy your tax liability arising from this Award. 
    
  5.      Disputes  :  Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, any adjustments to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with its authority under Section 4 of the Plan.  Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding. 
  
   9 

6.      Other Matters  : 
    
  (a)   The Award granted to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Company or any Subsidiary or other affiliate of the Company to grant an award in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Company (or any Subsidiary or other affiliate) might grant an award in any future year or in any given amount.  Decisions regarding any future grants of an award, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee. 
    
           (b)  
    As the grant of the Award is discretionary, the grant does not form part of your contract of employment.  If you are employed by any Company in the group other than the Company, the grant of the Award will not form a contractual relationship between you and the Company and will not form part of your contract of employment with the Subsidiary which employs you. 
       
  (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if you change classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee, the Company may make unilateral changes to the terms and conditions of this Award, including reducing the number of Shares subject to this Award, in accordance with Company policy. 
    
           (d) 
    This Award is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation for services that you have rendered to the Company or any Subsidiaries (including, as applicable, your employer).  Further, this Award is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, payment in lieu of notice, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments. 
       
  (e)   Your participation in the Plan is voluntary.  The Company, and its officers or directors, do not guarantee or make any representation to you regarding the performance of the Common Stock.  The future value of the Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with any certainty. 
    
           (f) 
    Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued Shares and the Company is a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions.  You acknowledge and agree that any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Award granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in Santa Clara County in the State of California.

           (h) 
    You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, your employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. 
       
           (i) 
    You understand that your employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, collect and hold certain personal information about you regarding your employment, the nature and amount of your compensation and the fact and conditions of your participation in the Plan, including, but not limited to, your name, gender, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, tax file number, social security number or other identification number, salary, tax information, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company and its Subsidiaries, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor and other personal data reasonably required for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan (the  Data ).  For more information about your employer s collection and processing of your Data for this purpose, please see Intuit s Global Employee Privacy Policy, which can be found on the Company s Intranet or by contacting your local human resources representative. 
       
           (j) 
    Data Transfer for Administration of Plan. 
       
           (i) 
    You understand that the Data may be transferred to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC at 2000 Westchester Avenue, Purchase, NY 10577 to assist with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan.  You understand that this recipient may act as a Data Controller under applicable privacy laws and consent  
     
   10 

that Morgan Stanley may receive, possess, use, retain, and transfer Data to provide support and organizational and technical services to implement, manage, and administer the Plan.  Morgan Stanley may be located in the United States or in other countries with different data privacy laws and a lower level of data privacy protections than in your country.  Your employer and the Company will implement appropriate measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of Data transferred.  You have the right to withdraw consent at any time with future effect. 
    
           (ii) 
    You understand that the Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan or as required by applicable laws.  You understand that your consent is voluntary and that you may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein with future effect, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative.  Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal. 
       
           (iii) 
    You understand, however, that while refusing or withdrawing your consent will not have a negative impact on your employment, it may affect your ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative. 
       
           (iv) 
    If you are located in the European Union, your employer and the Company process and transfer Data to Morgan Stanley on the legal basis of: (i) your consent where required under applicable law; (ii) entering into a contract with you and performing our obligations pursuant to such contract. 
       
  If you are an employee outside the United States, you will be asked to consent to this data transfer for implementation, administration and management of the Plan separately on the third party administrator s website when you accept your Award. 
    
           (k) 
    This Agreement, and any issuance of Shares hereunder, is intended to comply and shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.  Upon your Separation from Service, the Company shall determine whether any Shares issued to you in accordance with this Agreement could be determined to be payments from a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and whether you are a  specified employee  as of the applicable payment date (each as defined by Section 409A of the Code).  If you are determined to be a  specified employee  and any such payments are payable in connection with your Separation from Service, and are not exempt from Section 409A of the Code as a short-term deferral or otherwise, these payments, to the extent otherwise payable within six (6) months after your date of Separation from Service, will be paid in a lump sum on the earlier of: (i) the date that is six (6) months after your date of Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death.  The foregoing six (6) month delay shall be applied if and only to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A of the Code.  For purposes of this Agreement, a  Separation from Service  means an anticipated permanent reduction in the level of bona fide services to twenty percent (20%) or less of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding thirty-six (36) month period.  For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the payments to be made to you in accordance with this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. 
       
  7.      Miscellaneous  :  This Agreement (including the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to this Award, and supersedes all prior agreements or promises with respect to the Award.  Except as provided in the Plan, this Agreement may be amended only by a written document signed by the Company and you.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Company may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of the Company.  Subject to the restrictions on transfer of an Award described in Section 14 of the Plan, this Agreement shall be binding on your permitted successors and assigns (including heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives).  All notices required under this Agreement or the Plan must be mailed or hand-delivered, (1) in the case of the Company, to the Company, attn.: Stock Administration at 2535 Garcia Ave., Mountain View, CA 94043, or at such other address designated in writing by the Company to you, and (2) in the case of you, at the address recorded in the books and records of the Company as your then current home address.  You acknowledge and agree that any such notices from the Company to you may also be delivered through the Company s electronic mail system (prior to your Termination Date) or at the last email address you provided to the Company (after your Termination Date).

  Vesting Based on Achievement of Threshold Performance and Service  .  This Award will be eligible to vest only if the threshold level of performance, as defined in Exhibit A (the  Threshold Goal ), is achieved and is certified by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of Intuit s Board of Directors (the  Committee ).  If the Threshold Goal is not achieved and/or certified by the Committee, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, this Award will immediately terminate and you will not be entitled to receive any Shares under this Award.  If the Threshold Goal is achieved and certified by the Committee, then you will have the opportunity to vest in this Award as to 33 1/3% of the Number of Shares on each of July 1, [year] (or, if later, the date that the Threshold Goal is certified), July 1, [year], and July 1, [year] (each a  Vesting Date ), provided, in each case, you have not Terminated before the respective Vesting Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections 1(b) through 1(d) provide certain circumstances in which you may vest in all or a portion of this Award without certification of the Threshold Goal and/or before the foregoing Vesting Dates.  Any portion of this Award that does not vest, including pursuant to Sections 1(b) through 1(d), shall be cancelled and you will have no further right or claim thereunder. 
    
  1.    In the event of your Termination prior to the last Vesting Date, the following provisions will govern the vesting of this Award: 
    
  (a)     Termination Generally  :  In the event of your Termination prior to the last Vesting Date for any reason other than as expressly set forth in the other subsections of this Section 1 of the Agreement, this Award immediately will stop vesting and will terminate, and you will have no further right or claim to anything under this Award (other than with respect to the portion of the Award that has previously vested). 
    
  (b)     Termination due to Retirement  :  In the event of your Termination prior to the last Vesting Date due to your Retirement, then, provided that the Threshold Goal is both met and certified by the Committee, you will vest in a pro-rata portion of the Number of Shares, to be calculated as follows: divide your number of full months of service since the Date of Grant by thirty-six (36) months, multiply that quotient by the Number of Shares, then subtract any Shares in which you already have vested, and round down to the nearest whole Share, and the Vesting Date under this Agreement will be your Termination Date.  For purposes of this Award,  Retirement  means the Termination of your employment with the Company after you have reached age fifty-five (55) and completed ten (10) full years of service with the Company (including any parent or Subsidiary). 
    
  (c)     Termination due to Death or Disability  :  In the event of your Termination prior to the last Vesting Date due to your death or Disability after you have been actively employed by the Company for one year or more, this Award will vest as to 100% of the Number of Shares on your Termination Date, minus any Shares in which you already have vested, regardless of whether the Threshold Goal has been met, and the Vesting Date under this Agreement will be your Termination Date.  For purposes of this Award,  Disability  is defined in Section 30(j) of the Plan. 
    
  (d)     Termination On or Within One Year Following Corporate Transaction  :  In the event of your Termination by the Company or its successor on or within one year following the date of a Corporate Transaction and prior to the last Vesting Date, you will vest in a pro-rata portion of the Number of Shares, regardless of whether the Threshold  
  
   13 

Goal has been met, to be calculated as follows: divide your number of full months of service since the Date of Grant by thirty-six (36) months, multiply that quotient by the Number of Shares, then subtract any Shares in which you already have vested, and round down to the nearest whole Share, and the Vesting Date under this Agreement will be your Termination Date.  For purposes of this Award,  Corporate Transaction  is defined in Section 30(i) of the Plan. 
    
  (e)  For purposes of this Agreement, your Termination will be deemed to occur on the Termination Date, as defined in the Plan. 
    
           2. 
    Automatic Deferral; Issuance of Shares under this Award  : 
       
           (a) 
    Following a Vesting Date, and subject to Section 4 of the Agreement, the Company will issue you the Shares that became vested on such Vesting Date as soon as reasonably possible after the earliest of (i) the date that is one year following the applicable Vesting Date, (ii) the date of your death or termination of employment on account of Disability, or (iii) the occurrence of a Corporate Transaction that is a 409A Change in Control (as defined below).  In the event that the 409A Change in Control precedes such Vesting Date, the Company will issue you the Shares that become vested on such Vesting Date as soon as reasonably possible following such Vesting Date.  For avoidance of doubt, the occurrence of a Corporate Transaction that is not a 409A Change in Control will not trigger the issuance of Shares prior to the date that is one year following the applicable Vesting Date. 
       
           (b) 
    Upon the occurrence of an event described in Sections 1(b), 1(c) or 1(d), any Shares that become vested on account of the application of Sections 1(b), 1(c) or 1(d) will be issued to you by the Company as soon as reasonably possible after the occurrence thereof.  In addition, upon the occurrence of an event described in Sections 1(b), 1(c) or 1(d) after a Vesting Date, any Shares that previously became vested on account of the occurrence of such Vesting Date but have not yet been issued to you shall be issued by the Company as soon as reasonably possible after the occurrence of the event described in Section 1(b), 1(c) or 1(d), but in any event in compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), including the provisions of Section 6(k) below. 
       
           (c) 
    A  409A Change in Control  shall mean a  change in the ownership or effective control  of the Company or  change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets  of the Company within the meaning of Treasury Regulations   1.409A-3(a)(5) and 1.409A-3(i). 
       
           (d) 
    For purposes of this Award, each date on which the shares are issued to you in respect of the Award is referred to as a  Settlement Date.   Until the date the Shares are issued to you, you will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company.  You acknowledge and agree that you may be required to provide a written or electronic acknowledgement prior to the issuance of any Shares to you by the Company under this Agreement.

           (e) 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon your Termination by the Company for Cause (as defined below), any portion of the Award that has not been previously settled will terminate, be forfeited, and you will have no further right or claim to anything under this Award.   Cause  means, for purposes of this Agreement, (i) gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of your duties to the Company (other than as a result of a Disability) that has resulted or is likely to result in material damage to the Company, after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board of Directors which specifically identifies the manner in which you have not substantially performed your duties and you have been provided with a reasonable opportunity of not less than 30 days to cure any alleged gross negligence or willful misconduct; (ii) commission of any act of fraud with respect to the Company; or (iii) conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude.  No act or failure to act by you will be considered  willful  if done or omitted by you in good faith with reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.

           3.

These dividend equivalents shall be paid upon the later of (a) the date dividends are paid to the common stockholders of the Company, or (b) the date the Restricted Stock Units with respect to which such dividend equivalents are payable become vested and the underlying Shares are issued (it being understood that no dividend equivalents will be  
     
   14

           4. 
    Withholding Taxes  :  If you are subject to United States federal income and employment taxes, this Award is generally taxable upon a Settlement Date based on the Fair Market Value on such date; provided that this Award may become taxable for purposes of employment taxes upon vesting, if earlier than a Settlement Date.  For further detail, and for information regarding taxation in other jurisdictions, you should refer to the Global Supplement, which is an attachment to and is incorporated by reference into this Agreement.  To the extent required by applicable law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, employment tax, social security tax, social insurance, payroll tax, contributions, payment on account or other withholding obligations that arise under this Award and, if applicable, any sale of Shares.  The Company shall not be required to issue Shares pursuant to this Award or to recognize any purported transfer of Shares until such obligations are satisfied.  Subject to the Company s discretion and in compliance with applicable laws, these obligations may be satisfied by the Company withholding a number of Shares that would otherwise be issued under this Award that the Company determines has a Fair Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations (determined using a rate of up to the maximum statutory rate in the applicable jurisdictions), including but not limited to withholding with respect to income and/or employment taxes on this Award, including any stock-settled dividend equivalent rights paid with respect to any Shares underlying this Award.  Subject to the Company s discretion and in compliance with applicable laws, these obligations may also be satisfied by other methods including, but not limited to: (a) through a  same day sale  commitment from you and a FINRA Dealer meeting the requirements of the Company s  same day sale  procedures, (b) having the Company withhold amounts from amounts otherwise payable to you under the Company s payroll system, and (c) any other methods approved by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, since you are a Section 16 Officer of the Company, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and you, these obligations will be satisfied by the Company withholding a number of Shares that would otherwise be issued under this Award that the Company determines has a Fair Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations (determined as the minimum statutory rate in the applicable jurisdictions), including but not limited to withholding with respect to income and/or employment taxes on this Award, including any stock-settled dividend equivalent rights paid with respect to any Shares underlying this Award.  For purposes of this Award,  Fair Market Value  is defined in Section 30(m) of the Plan. 
       
  You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with this Award, regardless of any action the Company takes or any transaction pursuant to this section with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with this Award.  The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of this Award or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares underlying the Award that vest.  The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure this Award to reduce or eliminate your tax liability or to ensure that the tax withholding is sufficient to entirely satisfy your tax liability arising from this Award. 
    
           5. 
    Disputes  :  Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, any adjustments to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with its authority under Section 4 of the Plan.

           6. 
    Other Matters  : 
       
           (a) 
    The Award granted to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Company or any Subsidiary or other affiliate of the Company to grant an award in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Company (or any Subsidiary or other affiliate) might grant an award in any future year or in any given amount.  Decisions regarding any future grants of an award, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee. 
       
           (b) 
    As the grant of the Award is discretionary, the grant does not form part of your contract of employment.  If you are employed by any Company in the group other than the Company, the grant of the Award will not form a contractual relationship between you and the Company and will not form part of your contract of employment with the Subsidiary which employs you. 
       
           (c) 
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if you change classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee, the Company may make unilateral changes to the terms and conditions of this Award, including reducing the number of Shares subject to this Award, in accordance with Company policy.

    This Agreement, and any issuance of Shares hereunder, is intended to comply and shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.  Upon your Separation from Service, the Company shall determine whether any Shares issued to you in accordance with this Agreement could be determined to be payments from a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and whether you are a  specified employee  as of the applicable payment date (each as defined by Section 409A of the Code).  If you are determined to be a  specified employee  and any such payments are payable in connection with your Separation from Service, and are not exempt from Section 409A of the Code as a short-term deferral or otherwise, these payments, to the extent otherwise payable within six (6) months after your date of Separation from Service, will be paid in a lump sum on the earlier of: (i) the date that is six (6) months after your date of Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death.  The foregoing six (6) month delay shall be applied if and only to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A of the Code.  For purposes of this Agreement, a  Separation from Service  means an anticipated permanent reduction in the level of bona fide services to twenty percent (20%) or less of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding thirty-six (36) month period.  For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the payments to be made to you in accordance with this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments.

Award No.   *** 
  INTUIT INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2005 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN GRANT AGREEMENT  Restricted Stock Unit   (Executive Performance-Based Vesting: Relative Total Shareholder Return Goals) 
  Intuit Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Intuit  or the  Company ), hereby grants you a restricted stock unit award ( Award ) pursuant to the Company s Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), of the Company s common stock, $0.01 par value per share ( Common Stock  or  Shares ).  The maximum number of Shares that are subject to the Award and may become eligible to vest ( Maximum Shares ) is set forth below.  All capitalized terms in this Grant Agreement ( Agreement ) that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan.  This Agreement shall include any appendices, addenda or consents attached hereto or otherwise associated herewith.  This Award is subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.  This Agreement is not meant to interpret, extend, or change the Plan in any way, or to represent the full terms of the Plan.  If there is any discrepancy, conflict or omission between this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall apply. 
    
  Name of Participant:     
  Address: 
  Maximum Shares:    [__] total (200% of the Target Shares) 
  Target Shares:    [__] total ([___] (one-third of the total number of Target Shares) for each of the three overlapping Performance Periods) 
  Date of Grant:         
  Vesting Date:  
    
  ***This information is as shown in the Restricted Stock Units section of the third party administrator s online portal. 
    
  Vesting Based on Achievement of Total Shareholder Return Goals  .  Subject to the service conditions included in this Agreement, vesting of this Award is based on Intuit s percentile rank of total shareholder return ( TSR ) among a group of comparator companies (the  Comparison Group ), as set forth on   Exhibit A   (the  TSR Goals ).  Actual performance against the TSR Goals is measured as follows: up to one-third of the Maximum Shares will be eligible to vest based on the actual performance against the TSR Goals as measured over the period beginning on August 1, [year] and ending on July 31, [year] (the  12 Month Performance Period ), up to one-third of the Maximum Shares will be eligible to vest based on the actual performance against the TSR Goals as measured over the period beginning on August 1, [year] and ending on July 31, [year] (the  24 Month Performance Period ), and up to one-third of the Maximum Shares will be eligible to be vest based on the actual performance against the TSR Goals as measured over the period beginning on August 1, [year] and ending on July 31, [year] (the  36 Month Performance Period  and together with the 12 Month Performance Period and the 24 Month Performance Period, the  Performance Periods  and each a  Performance Period ).  The actual performance against the TSR Goals for each Performance Period must be certified by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of Intuit s Board of Directors ( Committee ) in order for any portion of this Award to be eligible to vest;   provided  ,   however  , that if Intuit s TSR is negative during a Performance Period, then the maximum Shares that the Committee can certify as eligible to vest for that Performance Period will be the Target Shares for that Performance Period.  The Committee will certify the results of the TSR Goals as soon as reasonably possible (the date of such certification for the respective Performance Period, the  Certification Date ) after each Performance Period.  Any portion of this Award that is eligible to vest based on the Committee s certification will be subject to continued service through the Vesting Date in order to become fully vested.  For avoidance of doubt, you must remain in continued service with Intuit through and including the Vesting Date in order to become vested in any portion of the Award that becomes eligible to vest based on the Committee s certification.  Any portion of this Award that is not eligible to vest based on the Committee s certification for the applicable Performance Period will terminate on the Certification Date of the respective Performance Period. 
    
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections 1(b) through 1(e) provide certain circumstances in which you may vest in this Award before the Vesting Date and/or without certification of the TSR Goals by the Committee.  If any of Sections 1(b) through 1(e) apply, then any portion of this Award that does not vest pursuant to those sections will terminate. 
    
  Comparison Group  .  The Comparison Group will be the companies shown on   Exhibit B   (each, together with Intuit, a  Member Company  provided, however, that a company will be removed from the Comparison Group if, during a Performance Period, it ceases to have a class of equity securities that is both registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and actively traded on a U.S. public securities market (unless such cessation of such listing is due to any of the circumstances in (i) through (iv) of the following paragraph). 
    
  Definition of TSR  .   TSR  as applied to any Member Company means stock price appreciation from the beginning to the end of the applicable Performance Period, plus dividends and distributions made or declared (assuming such dividends or  
  
   18 

distributions are reinvested in the common stock of the Member Company) during such Performance Period, expressed as a percentage return.  Except as modified in Section 1(e), for purposes of computing TSR, the stock price at the beginning of a Performance Period will be the average price of a share of common stock of a Member Company over the 30 trading days beginning on August 1, [year], and the stock price at the end of the Performance Period will be the average price of a share of common stock of a Member Company over the 30 trading days ending (i) July 31, [year], for the 12 Month Performance Period, (ii) July 31, [year], for the 24 Month Performance Period, and (iii) July 31, [year] for the 36 Month Performance Period, adjusted for stock splits or similar changes in capital structure; provided, however, that TSR for a Member Company will be negative one hundred percent (-100%) if the Member Company: (i) files for bankruptcy, reorganization, or liquidation under any chapter of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; (ii) is the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding that is not dismissed within 30 days; (iii) is the subject of a stockholder approved plan of liquidation or dissolution; or (iv) ceases to conduct substantial business operations.  For avoidance of doubt, the acquisition of a Member Company by another person or group of related persons by itself does not result in the Member Company being treated as ceasing to conduct substantial business operations. 
    
           1. 
    In the event of your Termination prior to the Vesting Date, the following provisions will govern the vesting of this Award: 
       
           (a) 
    Termination Generally  :  In the event of your Termination prior to the Vesting Date for any reason other than as expressly set forth in the other subsections of this Section 1 of the Agreement, this Award immediately will terminate without having vested as to any of the Shares and you will have no right or claim to anything under this Award. 
       
           (b) 
    Termination due to Retirement  :  In the event of your Termination prior to the Vesting Date due to your Retirement, you will vest immediately on the date of your Retirement in a pro-rata portion of the Award, to be calculated as follows: divide your number of full months of service since the Date of Grant by thirty-six (36) months, multiply this quotient (the  pro rata percentage ) to the sum of (i) the number of Shares that were to vest on the Vesting Date, subject to your continued employment, based on the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, for each completed Performance Period, and (ii) 100% of the Target Shares that remain subject to any incomplete Performance Period, and round down to the nearest whole Share.  The Vesting Date under this Agreement will be your Termination Date.  Subject to Section 6(k), Shares that become vested in accordance with this Section 1(b) will be distributed to you as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of your Retirement.  For purposes of this Award,  Retirement  means the Termination of your employment with the Company after you have reached age fifty-five (55) and completed ten (10) full years of service with the Company (including any parent or Subsidiary).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time of your Retirement you will be a  covered employee  within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), then the number of Shares in which you shall vest with respect to any incomplete Performance Period shall be based on the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, after applying the pro rata percentage and rounding down to the nearest whole share, and such Shares will be distributed to you at the same time as other Participants after the Vesting Date. 
       
           (c) 
    Termination due to Death or Disability  :  In the event of your Termination prior to the Vesting Date due to your death or Disability after you have been actively employed by the Company for one year or more, this Award will vest immediately as to the sum of (i) the number of Shares that were to vest on the Vesting Date, assuming that you had continued employment until the Vesting Date, based on the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, for each completed Performance Period, and (ii) 100% of the Target Shares that remain subject to any incomplete Performance Period.  The Vesting Date under this Agreement will be your Termination Date.  Shares that become vested in accordance with this Section 1(c) will be distributed to you as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of your Termination due to your death or Disability.  For purposes of this Award,  Disability  is defined in Section 30(j) of the Plan. 
       
           (d) 
    Involuntary Termination  .  In the event of your Involuntary Termination before the Vesting Date, a pro rata portion of this Award will vest immediately on your Termination Date by applying the pro rata percentage to the sum of (i) the number of Shares that were to vest on the Vesting Date, assuming that you had continued employment until the Vesting Date, based on the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, for each completed Performance Period, and (ii) 100% of the Target Shares that remain subject to any incomplete Performance Period, and rounding down to the nearest whole Share.  The pro rata percentage will be a percentage equal to your number of full months of service since the Date of Grant   divided   by thirty-six months.  Subject to Section 6(k), Shares that become vested in accordance with this Section 1(d) will be distributed to you as soon as reasonably possible after the effective date of a waiver and general release of claims executed by you in favor of the Company and certain related persons determined by the Company in the form presented by the Company ( Release ).  If you do not execute the Release within forty-five (45) days following your Termination Date, or  
     
   19 

such longer period of time as may be required under applicable law, then you will not be entitled to the receipt of any Shares under this Section 1(d).  If the time period to execute and/or revoke the Release spans two calendar years, then, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Shares to be distributed to you pursuant to this Section 1(d) will not be distributed to you until the second calendar year.  Involuntary Termination means, for purposes of this Agreement, either (A) your Termination by the Company without Cause, or (B) your resignation for Good Reason.   Cause  means, for purposes of this Agreement, (i) gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of your duties to the Company (other than as a result of a Disability) that has resulted or is likely to result in material damage to the Company, after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which you have not substantially performed your duties and you have been provided with a reasonable opportunity of not less than 30 days to cure any alleged gross negligence or willful misconduct; (ii) commission of any act of fraud with respect to the Company; or (iii) conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude.  No act or failure to act by you will be considered  willful  if done or omitted by you in good faith with reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.   Good Reason  means, for the purposes of this Agreement, your resignation within sixty (60) days after the occurrence any of the following events without your consent: (i) a material reduction in your duties that is inconsistent with your position at the time of the Date of Grant, (ii) any material reduction in your base annual salary or target annual bonus (other than in connection with a general decrease in the base salaries or target bonuses for all officers of Intuit), or (iii) a requirement by Intuit that you relocate your principal office to a facility more than 50 miles from your principal office on the Date of Grant; provided however, that with regard to (i) through (iii) you must provide Intuit with written notice of the event allegedly constituting  Good Reason,  and Intuit will have 15 days from the date it receives such written notice to cure such event.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1(d) to the contrary, if you will be a  covered employee  under Section 162(m)(3) of the Code on the date of your Involuntary Termination, then your Award will not be treated as described above in this Section 1(d), but instead, a pro rata portion of this Award will vest on the Vesting Date calculated by applying the pro rata percentage to the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, and rounding down to the nearest whole Share.  Shares will be distributed to you at the same time as other Participants after the Vesting Date, provided that the Release has become effective.  If you do not execute the Release before the time that Shares are distributed to other Participants, then Shares will be distributed to you at the time the Release has become effective, provided that the Release becomes effective during the time period provided in this Section 1(d). 
    
           (e) 
    Corporate Transaction  :  In the event of a Corporate Transaction before the Vesting Date, the level of achievement of the TSR Goals will be based on the actual level of achievement of the TSR Goals, as certified by the Committee, for each completed Performance Period and will be determined as of the effective date of the Corporate Transaction based on the Comparison Group as constituted on such date (the  CIC Achievement Level ) for any incomplete Performance Period.  In addition, for any incomplete Performance Period, Intuit s ending stock price will be the sale price of the Shares in the Corporate Transaction and the ending stock price of the other Member Companies will be the average price of a share of common stock of a Member Company over the 30 trading days ending on the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, in each case adjusted for changes in capital structure.  This Award will vest immediately prior to the consummation of such Corporate Transaction based on the CIC Achievement Level.  Shares that become vested in accordance with this Section 1(e) will be distributed as soon as reasonably possible after such determinations are complete.  For avoidance of doubt, with respect to any incomplete Performance Period, this provision is intended to result in you vesting in the number of Shares corresponding to the CIC Achievement Level, without Committee certification, provided that you are employed immediately prior to the consummation of a Corporate Transaction.  For purposes of this Award,  Corporate Transaction  is defined in Section 30(i) of the Plan; provided that such Corporate Transaction constitutes a  change in the ownership or effective control  of the Company or  change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets  of the Company within the meaning of Treasury Regulations 1.409A-3(a)(5) and 1.409A-3(i). 
       
           (f) 
    For purposes of this Agreement, your Termination will be deemed to occur on the Termination Date, as defined in the Plan.

           4.

To the extent required by applicable law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, employment tax, social security tax, social insurance, payroll tax, contributions, payment on account or other withholding obligations that arise under this Award and, if applicable, any sale of Shares.  The Company shall not be required to issue Shares pursuant to this Award or to recognize any purported transfer of Shares until such obligations are satisfied.  Subject to the Company s discretion and in compliance with applicable laws, these obligations may be satisfied by the Company withholding a number of Shares that would otherwise be issued under this Award that the Company determines has a Fair Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations (determined using a rate of up to the maximum statutory rate in the applicable jurisdictions), including but not limited to withholding with respect to income and/or employment taxes on this Award, including any stock-settled dividend equivalent rights paid with respect to any Shares underlying this Award.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Section 16 Officer of the Company, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and you, these obligations will be satisfied by the Company withholding a number of Shares that would otherwise be issued under this Award that the Company determines has a Fair Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations (determined as the minimum statutory rate in the applicable jurisdictions), including but not limited to withholding with respect to income and/or employment taxes on this Award, including any stock-settled dividend equivalent rights paid with respect to any Shares underlying this Award.  For purposes of this Award,  Fair Market Value  is defined in Section 30(m) of the Plan.

           (iv)

           (k) 
    This Agreement, and any issuance of Shares hereunder, is intended to comply and shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.  Upon your Separation from Service, the Company shall determine whether any Shares issued to you in accordance with this Agreement could be determined to be payments from a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and whether you are a  specified employee  as of the applicable payment date (each as defined by Section 409A of the Code).  If you are determined to be a  specified employee  and any such payments are payable in connection with your Separation from Service, and are not exempt from Section 409A of the Code as a short-term deferral or otherwise, these payments, to the extent otherwise payable within six (6) months after your date of Separation from Service, will be paid in a lump sum on the earlier of: (i) the date that is six (6) months after your date of Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death.  The foregoing six (6) month delay shall be applied if and only to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A of the Code.  For purposes of this Agreement, a  Separation from Service  means an anticipated permanent reduction in the level of bona fide services to twenty percent (20%) or less of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding thirty-six (36) month period.  For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the payments to be made to you in accordance with this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. 
       
           7.

  Vesting Based on Achievement of Threshold Performance and Service  .  This Award will be eligible to vest only if the threshold level of performance, as defined in Exhibit A (the  Threshold Goal ), is achieved and is certified by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of Intuit s Board of Directors (the  Committee ).

Disputes  :  Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, any adjustments to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with its authority under Section 4 of the 2005 Plan and Section 7 of the MSPP.  Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding. 
    
  5.      Other Matters  : 
    
  (a)   The Award granted to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Company or any Subsidiary or other affiliate of the Company to grant an award in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Company (or any Subsidiary or other affiliate) might grant an award in any future year or in any given amount.  Decisions regarding any future grants of an award, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee. 
    
           (b)  
    As the grant of the Award is discretionary, the grant does not form part of your contract of employment. If you are employed by any Company in the group other than the Company, the grant of the Award will not form a contractual relationship between you and the Company and will not form part of your contract of employment with the Subsidiary which employs you.  
       
  (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if you change classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee, the Company may make unilateral changes to the terms and conditions of this Award, including reducing the number of Shares subject to this Award, in accordance with Company policy. 
    
           (d) 
    This Award is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation for services that you have rendered to the Company or any Subsidiaries (including, as applicable, your employer). Further, this Award is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, payment in lieu of notice, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments. 
       
  (e)   Your participation in the MSPP or the 2005 Plan is voluntary. The Company, and its officers or directors, do not guarantee or make any representation to you regarding the performance of the Common Stock. The future value of the Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with any certainty.  
    
           (f) 
    Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued Shares and the Company is a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. You acknowledge and agree that any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Award granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in Santa Clara County in the State of California.    
       
           (g)

any future year or in any given amount.  Decisions regarding any future grants of an award, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee. 
    
           (b)  
    As the grant of the Award is discretionary, the grant does not form part of your contract of employment.  If you are employed by any Company in the group other than the Company, the grant of the Award will not form a contractual relationship between you and the Company and will not form part of your contract of employment with the Subsidiary which employs you.  
       
  (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if you change classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee, the Company may make unilateral changes to the terms and conditions of this Award, including reducing the number of Shares subject to this Award, in accordance with Company policy. 
    
           (d) 
    This Award is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation for services that you have rendered to the Company or any Subsidiaries (including, as applicable, your employer).  Further, this Award is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, payment in lieu of notice, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments. 
       
  (e)   Your participation in the MSPP or the 2005 Plan is voluntary.  The Company, and its officers or directors, do not guarantee or make any representation to you regarding the performance of the Common Stock.  The future value of the Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with any certainty.  
    
           (f) 
    Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued Shares and the Company is a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions.  You acknowledge and agree that any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Award granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in Santa Clara County in the State of California.    
       
           (g) 
    Communications regarding the MSPP, the 2005 Plan, and this Award may be made by electronic delivery through an online or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.  You hereby acknowledge that you have read this provision and consent to the electronic delivery of the documents. 
       
           (h) 
    You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, your employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the MSPP and the 2005 Plan. 
       
           (i) 
    You understand that your employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, collect and hold certain personal information about you regarding your employment, the nature and amount of your compensation and the fact and conditions of your participation in the MSPP and the 2005 Plan, including, but not limited to, your name, gender, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, tax file number, social security number or other identification number, salary, tax information, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company and its Subsidiaries, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor and other personal data reasonably required for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the MSPP and the 2005 Plan (the  Data ).  For more information about your employer s collection and processing of your Data for this purpose, please see Intuit s Global Employee Privacy Policy, which can be found on the Company s Intranet or by contacting your local human resources representative.  
       
           (j) 
    Data Transfer for Administration of the MSPP and the 2005 Plan. 
       
           (i) 
    You understand that Data may be transferred to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC at 2000 Westchester Avenue, Purchase, NY 10577 to assist with the implementation, administration and management of the MSPP and the 2005 Plan.  You understand that this recipient may act as a Data Controller under applicable privacy laws and consent that Morgan Stanley may receive, possess, use, retain, and transfer Data to provide support and organizational and technical services to implement, manage, and administer the MSPP and the 2005 Plan.  Morgan Stanley may be located in the United States or in other countries with different data privacy laws and a lower level of data privacy protections than in your country.  Your employer and the Company will  
     
   36 

implement appropriate measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of Data transferred.  You have the right to withdraw consent at any time with future effect. 
    
           (ii) 
    You understand that the Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the MSPP and the 2005 Plan or as required by applicable laws.  You understand that your consent is voluntary and that you may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein with future effect, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative.  Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal. 
       
           (iii) 
    You understand, however, that while refusing or withdrawing your consent will not have a negative impact on your employment, it may affect your ability to participate in the MSPP and the 2005 Plan.  For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative. 
       
           (k) 
    This Agreement, and any issuance of Shares hereunder, is intended to comply and shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.  Upon your Separation from Service, the Company shall determine whether any Shares issued to you in accordance with this Agreement could be determined to be payments from a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and whether you are a  specified employee  as of the applicable payment date (each as defined by Section 409A of the Code).  If you are determined to be a  specified employee  and any such payments are payable in connection with your Separation from Service, and are not exempt from Section 409A of the Code as a short-term deferral or otherwise, these payments, to the extent otherwise payable within six (6) months after your date of Separation from Service, will be paid in a lump sum on the earlier of: (i) the date that is six (6) months after your date of Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death.  The foregoing six (6) month delay shall be applied if and only to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A of the Code.  For purposes of this Agreement, a  Separation from Service  means an anticipated permanent reduction in the level of bona fide services to twenty percent (20%) or less of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding thirty-six (36) month period.  For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the payments to be made to you in accordance with this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments.  
       
  7.      Miscellaneous  :  This Agreement (including the MSPP and the 2005 Plan, which are incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to this Award, and supersedes all prior agreements or promises with respect to the Award.  Except as provided in the MSPP and/or the 2005 Plan, this Agreement may be amended only by a written document signed by the Company and you.  Subject to the terms of the MSPP and the 2005 Plan, the Company may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of the Company.  Subject to the restrictions on transfer of an Award described in Section 14 of the 2005 Plan, this Agreement shall be binding on your permitted successors and assigns (including heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives).  All notices required under this Agreement or the MSPP or the 2005 Plan must be mailed or hand-delivered, (1) in the case of the Company, to the Company, attn.: Stock Administration at 2535 Garcia Ave., Mountain View, CA 94043, or at such other address designated in writing by the Company to you, and (2) in the case of you, at the address recorded in the books and records of the Company as your then current home address.  You acknowledge and agree that any such notices from the Company to you may also be delivered through the Company s electronic mail system (prior to your Termination Date) or at the last email address you provided to the Company (after your Termination Date).  
    
  Additional information about the MSPP, the 2005 Plan, and this Award (including certain tax consequences related to the Award) is contained in the accompanying Prospectus.

  New Hire, Promotion, Retention or Focal Grant 
  Intuit Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ), hereby grants you a stock option ( Option ), pursuant to the Company s Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), to purchase shares of the Company s Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share ( Common Stock  or  Shares ), as described below.  All capitalized terms in this Grant Agreement ( Agreement ) that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan.  This Agreement shall include any appendices, addenda or consents attached hereto or otherwise associated herewith.  This Option is subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.  This Agreement is not meant to interpret, extend or change the Plan in any way, or to represent the full terms of the Plan.  If there is any discrepancy, conflict or omission between this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall apply. 
  Name of Participant:    *** 
  Number of Shares:    *** 
  Exercise Price Per Share:    *** 
  Date of Grant:    *** 
  First Vesting Date:        *** 
  Expiration Date:    *** 
    
  *** The above information is as shown in the Stock Options section of the third party administrator s online portal. 
    
           Vesting Schedule: 
    So long as you are providing services to the Company, 33 1/3% of the Shares will vest on the First Vesting Date; then 2.778% of the Shares will vest on each monthly anniversary of the first Vesting Date until 100% vested. 
       
           1. 
    Termination  :  On your Termination, this Option will either cease to vest or, as provided in Section 5.6 of the Plan, accelerate in full if you have been actively employed by the Company for one year or more and become Disabled or die.  Vesting may also be suspended in accordance with Company policies, as described in Sections 5.3 and 5.6 of the Plan. 
       
  In the event of your Termination prior to the last Vesting Date due to your Retirement, you will vest in a pro-rata portion of the Number of Shares, to be calculated as follows: divide your number of full months of service since the Date of Grant by thirty-six (36) months, multiply that quotient by the Number of Shares, then subtract any Shares in which you already have vested, and round down to the nearest whole Share. For purposes of this Option,  Retirement  means the Termination of your employment with the Company after you have reached age fifty-five (55) and completed ten (10) full years of service with the Company (including any parent or Subsidiary). 
    
  In the event of your Termination by the Company or its successor on or within one year following the date of a Corporate Transaction and prior to the final Vesting Date, you will vest in a pro-rata portion of the Number of Shares, to be calculated as follows: divide your number of full months of service since the Date of Grant by thirty-six (36) months, multiply that quotient by the Number of Shares, then subtract any Shares in which you already have vested, and round down to the nearest whole Share.  For purposes of this Option,  Corporate Transaction  is defined in Section 30(i) of the Plan. 
    
  For purposes of this Agreement, your Termination will be deemed to occur on the Termination Date, as defined in the Plan. 
           2. 
    Option Exercise  : 
              (a) 
    To exercise this Option, you must follow the exercise procedures established by the Company, as described in Section 5.5 of the Plan.  This Option may be exercised only with respect to vested Shares.  Payment of the Exercise Price for the Shares may be made in cash (by check) and/or, if a public market exists for the Company s Common Stock, by means of a Same-Day-Sale Commitment or Margin Commitment from you and a FINRA Dealer meeting the requirements of the Company s  same day sale  procedures.  You understand that the Company may be required to withhold taxes upon exercise of this Option. 
              (b) 
    Subject to the exercise procedures established by the Company, the last day this Option may be exercised is seven years from the Date of Grant which is the Expiration Date.  If your Termination Date occurs before the Expiration Date, this Option will expire as to all unvested Shares subject to the Option on your Termination Date.  Following your Termination Date, this Option may be exercised with respect to vested Shares during the following post-termination exercise periods: 
              a. 
    Following your Termination due to your Retirement or to your Disability, this Option may be exercised with respect to vested Shares no later than twelve (12) months after the Termination Date; 
              b. 
    Following your Termination due to your death, or upon your death if it occurs within three (3) months following your Termination Date, this Option may be exercised with respect to vested Shares no later than eighteen (18) months after the Termination Date; 
     
   38 

c. 
    Following your Termination for any other reason, this Option may be exercised with respect to vested Shares no later than ninety (90) days after the Termination Date. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, no portion of this Option may be exercised after the Expiration Date.  To the extent this Option is not exercised before the end of the applicable post-termination exercise period, in accordance with the exercise procedures established by the Company, the Option will expire as to all Shares remaining subject thereto. 
    
           3. 
    Withholding Taxes  :  If you are subject to United States federal income and employment taxes, this Option is generally taxable upon exercise based on the Fair Market Value on the date the Option (or portion thereof) vests.  For further detail, and for information regarding taxation in other jurisdictions, you should refer to the Global Supplement, which is an attachment to and is incorporated by reference into this Agreement.  To the extent required by applicable law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, employment tax, social security tax, social insurance, payroll tax, contributions, payment on account or other withholding obligations that arise under this Option and, if applicable, any sale of Shares.  The Company shall not be required to issue Shares pursuant to this Option or to recognize any purported transfer of Shares until such obligations are satisfied.  Subject to the Company s discretion and in compliance with applicable laws, these obligations may also be satisfied by the Company withholding a number of Shares that would otherwise be issued under this Option that the Company determines has a Fair Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations (determined using a rate of up to the maximum statutory rate in the applicable jurisdictions), including but not limited to withholding with respect to income and/or employment taxes on this Option.  Subject to the Company s discretion and in compliance with applicable laws, these obligations may otherwise be satisfied by other methods including, but not limited to: (a) through a  same day sale  commitment from the you and a FINRA Dealer meeting the requirements of the Company s  same day sale  procedures, (b) having the Company withhold amounts from amounts otherwise payable to you under the Company s payroll system, and (c) any other methods approved by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Section 16 Officer of the Company, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and you, these obligations will be satisfied by the Company withholding a number of Shares that would otherwise be issued under this Option that the Company determines has a Fair Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations (determined as the minimum statutory rate in the applicable jurisdictions), including but not limited to withholding with respect to income and/or employment taxes on this Option.  For purposes of this Option,  Fair Market Value  is defined in Section 30(m) of the Plan. 
       
  You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with this Option, regardless of any action the Company takes or any transaction pursuant to this section with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with this Option.  The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or exercise of this Option or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares underlying the Option that vest and are exercised.  The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure this Option to reduce or eliminate your tax liability or to ensure that the tax withholding is sufficient to entirely satisfy your tax liability arising from this Option. 
    
           4. 
    Disputes  :  Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, any adjustments to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with its authority under Section 4 of the Plan.  Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding. 
       
           5. 
    Other Matters  : 
       
           (a) 
    The Option granted to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Company or any Subsidiary or other affiliate of the Company to grant an award in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Company (or any Subsidiary or other affiliate) might grant an award in any future year or in any given amount.  Decisions regarding any future grants of an award, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee. 
       
           (b) 
    As the grant of the Option is discretionary, the grant does not form part of your contract of employment.  If you are employed by any Company in the group other than the Company, the grant of the Option will not form a contractual relationship between you and the Company and will not form part of your contract of employment with the Subsidiary which employs you. 
       
           (c) 
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if you change classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee, the Company may make unilateral changes to the terms and conditions of this Option, including reducing the number of Shares subject to this Option, in accordance with Company policy. 

39 

(d) 
    This Option is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation for services that you have rendered to the Company or any Subsidiaries (including, as applicable, your employer).  Further, this Option is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, payment in lieu of notice, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments. 
       
           (e) 
    Your participation in the Plan is voluntary.  The Company, and its officers or directors, do not guarantee or make any representation to you regarding the performance of the Common Stock.  The future value of the Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with any certainty. 
       
           (f) 
    Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued Shares and the Company is a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions.  You acknowledge and agree that any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Option granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in Santa Clara County in the State of California.

           (a) 
    You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, your employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. 
       
           (b) 
    You understand that your employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, collect and hold certain personal information about you regarding your employment, the nature and amount of your compensation and the fact and conditions of your participation in the Plan, including, but not limited to, your name, gender, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, tax file number, social security number or other identification number, salary, tax information, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company and its Subsidiaries, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor and other personal data reasonably required for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan (the  Data ).

Exhibit 10.47 

INTUIT INC. PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN 
  effective August 1, 2017 
    
           1. 
    Overview:    Intuit Inc. s Performance Incentive Plan ( IPI ) is a program under which Intuit Inc., including its subsidiaries which are incorporated outside of the United States of America, as well as branches, representative or liaison offices registered outside of the United States of America, hereinafter collectively referred to as  Intuit,  pay discretionary cash bonus awards to select employees. Bonus awards under the IPI, if any, are paid annually. The amount of a bonus award, if any, is based upon the employee s bonus target, the performance of Intuit or any portion thereof, as applicable, during the plan year, the employee s performance during the plan year, and the bonus pool made available for payments under the IPI for the applicable plan year. 
       
           2. 
    Purposes  :  The IPI is a component of Intuit s overall strategy to pay its employees for performance. The purposes of IPI are to: (i) attract and retain top performing employees; (ii) motivate employees by tying compensation to the performance of Intuit or any portion thereof, as applicable; and (iii) reward exceptional individual performance that supports overall Intuit objectives.  
       
           3. 
    Eligibility  :  Unless otherwise required by applicable law, all employees of Intuit who are on the payroll of Intuit are eligible to participate in the IPI for a plan year, except for employees who (i) are classified as seasonal employees, (ii) are classified as interns/project employees, (iii) participate in Intuit s Senior Executive Incentive Plan, unless such employee is specifically approved by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. ( Compensation Committee ) also to participate in the IPI, (iv) participate in other incentive compensation plans that specifically exclude an employee s participation in the IPI, including, but not limited to, sales incentive compensation plans and contact center incentive compensation plans, (v) participate in an incentive compensation plan sponsored by Intuit for international employees that is designed to provide a cash incentive benefit to such employees comparable to or in lieu of the IPI, (vi) work for Intuit on a purely commission basis, (vii) commence employment pursuant to an offer letter which excludes participation in the IPI, (viii) as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee at any time in its sole discretion, or (ix) as otherwise determined under Paragraph 8 of the IPI. Those employees who are determined to be eligible for bonus awards under the IPI are called  Participants .  Participants in the IPI (other than Senior Officers, which term means the Chief Financial Officer, any Executive Vice President, the Vice President of Internal Audit and any other officer who is a Section 16 officer) are not eligible to simultaneously participate in any other bonus or cash incentive plan, unless the Officer in charge of Human Resources or his/her delegate otherwise specifically approves such participation. Senior Officers who are Participants in the IPI are not eligible to simultaneously participate in any other bonus or cash incentive plan, unless the Compensation Committee otherwise specifically approves such participation. An employee must commence employment

Exhibit 10.47 

or otherwise become eligible to participate in the IPI no later than March 31   st    of the applicable plan year to be eligible for a bonus award under the IPI for such plan year. Being a Participant does not entitle the individual to receive a bonus award. Bonus awards, if any, may become payable to Participants who meet the criteria set forth in Paragraph 5 below. 
    
           4. 
    Plan Year  :  The IPI operates on a fiscal year basis (August 1   st    through July 31   st   ). 
       
           5. 
    Bonus Awards  :  Bonus awards are discretionary payments. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, a Participant must be an active employee in good standing and on the payroll of Intuit on July 31   st    of the applicable plan year to receive a bonus payment for that plan year. A Participant who is not actively employed and on Intuit s payroll for any reason on July 31   st    of the applicable plan year is not entitled to a partial or pro rata bonus award for such plan year, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Intuit may make exceptions in its sole discretion, provided, however, any such exception must be made by the Compensation Committee or its delegate. There is no minimum award or guaranteed payment. A bonus award is calculated at the discretion of the Compensation Committee after (1) considering the corporate and financial goals of Intuit or any portion thereof, as applicable, the Participant s bonus target and performance for the plan year, and other factors considered to be relevant by the Compensation Committee, and (2) the bonus pool has been determined and made available for bonus awards under the IPI for the plan year. 
       
           a. 
    Bonus Targets  :       
              i. 
    For each Participant who is paid an annual salary, his or her bonus target shall be established as a percentage of the Participant s annual base salary. For each Participant who is paid on an hourly basis, his or her bonus target shall be established as a percentage of the Participant s projected annual hourly pay based on the number of hours that the Participant is expected to work.  A Participant who is not a Participant for an entire plan year may have his or her bonus target calculated with respect to a portion of his or her annual base salary or projected annual hourly pay for such plan year. To the extent required by applicable law, if a Participant has received overtime pay, Intuit will take such pay into consideration in the calculation of the IPI award. 
       
           ii. 
    When an employee becomes a Participant, he or she shall be advised of his or her bonus target for the applicable plan year.   
       
           iii. 
    Following the beginning of a plan year, each Participant shall be advised of his or her bonus target by the executive leader of the Participant s business or functional unit or the executive leader s designee.

Exhibit 10.47 

iv. 
    The Compensation Committee shall establish individual bonus targets for Senior Officers who are Participants. The President and Chief Executive Officer may establish individual bonus targets for other officers who are Participants. Bonus targets for other employees whose bonus targets are not established by the Compensation Committee or the President and Chief Executive Officer shall be established by the Officer in charge of Human Resources or his/her delegate in consultation with the President and Chief Executive Officer. 
       
           v. 
    A Participant s bonus target for a plan year may be determined based upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to, the corporate and financial goals of Intuit or any portion thereof, his or her base salary or base pay, position or level. A bonus target does not guarantee that a bonus award will be made or, if a bonus award is made, that it will be made at the target rate. 
       
           b. 
    Determination of a Bonus Award Amount        
              i. 
    The amount of a bonus award, if any, to a Participant who is a Senior Officer shall be determined by the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the President and Chief Executive Officer. The amount of a bonus award, if any, to a Participant who is not a Senior Officer shall be determined by the executive leader of the Participant s business unit or functional group and the President and Chief Executive Officer in consultation with the Participant s direct manager and the Officer in charge of Human Resources or his/her delegate. 
       
           ii. 
    A Participant s bonus award, if any, may be linked to an assessment of the achievement of corporate and financial goals of Intuit or any portion thereof and the Participant s total job performance for the applicable plan year. Factors that may be considered, include but are not limited to, what the Participant does to advance Intuit s success and how the Participant does it, especially leadership, balance of short-term actions with long-term goals, resource allocation and maintenance by the Participant of focus on Intuit while prioritizing the needs of customers, employees and stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the IPI to the contrary, the amount of the bonus, if any, payable to a Participant under the IPI shall be determined in the sole discretion of Intuit (by the applicable decision maker(s) described in Section 5(b)(i) above), which determination may be based on the foregoing assessment or any other considerations deemed appropriate. 
       
           iii. 
    There is neither a minimum nor maximum amount of a bonus award that may be paid to a Participant for a plan year. Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5, at Intuit s discretion, a bonus award  
     
   3 

Exhibit 10.47 

amount may be prorated based on the length of a Participant s service or other factors, provided, however, that decisions relating to Senior Officers must be made by the Compensation Committee. 
    
           iv. 
    Except as otherwise prohibited by law or as determined by Intuit, in its sole discretion, Participant shall be responsible for taxes, social contributions and withholding applicable to any bonus award. 
       
           c. 
    When Bonus Awards are Paid  :  The timing for payment of a bonus award shall be determined by the Officer in charge of Human Resources or his/her delegate in consultation with the President and Chief Executive Officer and other senior management of Intuit. Except to the extent required by applicable law, a Participant has no right to a bonus award or any portion of a bonus award until it is earned upon being determined in accordance with Section 5(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an administrative error in the calculation or payment of a bonus award to a Participant, Intuit reserves the right to seek recovery from a Participant of an erroneously paid excessive bonus amount.  Once a bonus award is no longer subject to a  substantial risk of forfeiture  (as determined pursuant to regulations and/or other guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) and the Participant is subject to Section 409A of the Code ( Section 409A ), then it shall be paid not later than the later of: (i) 2  months after the end of Intuit s first taxable year when the bonus award is no longer subject to such  substantial risk of forfeiture , or (ii) 2  months after the end of such Participant s first taxable year when the bonus award is no longer subject to such  substantial risk of forfeiture  unless a later date is established by Intuit, or Intuit permits the Participant to designate a later date, in either case only as permitted under Section 409A of the Code.   
              6. 
    Unfunded  :  The IPI is not funded. Bonus awards, if any, shall be made from the general assets of Intuit and paid in the form of cash. The Compensation Committee shall determine in its sole discretion the amount of funds that shall be made available for bonus awards under the IPI based on the performance of Intuit or any portion thereof for the applicable plan year, but which may not in any event exceed 150% of the bonus targets for all Participants, calculated on an aggregate, company-wide basis. The performance of Intuit or any portion thereof for this purpose may be measured in a number of ways, including but not limited to: financial measures, such as revenue and operating income; qualitative measures, such as accomplishments to position the business for the future; the year s market conditions; stockholder returns; and progress of Intuit s business model. Intuit shall have no obligation to pay any bonus awards under the IPI simply because the Compensation Committee has determined that a certain sum has been made available from which to pay bonus awards.  But in no event may the amount of the aggregate bonuses paid under the IPI for a given plan year exceed the amount of funds made available by the Compensation Committee.  
     
   4 

Exhibit 10.47 

7. 
    Amendment or Termination  :  The Compensation Committee has the authority to terminate, change, modify or amend the provisions of the IPI at any time in its sole discretion, including during or after a plan year, which termination, change, modification or amendment may have retroactive effect. Furthermore, the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Officer in charge of Human Resources  each individually has the authority to make amendments to the IPI that do not significantly increase the cost of the IPI and which in such individual s determination (i) clarify the terms of the IPI; (ii) assist in the administration of the IPI; (iii) are necessary or advisable for the IPI to comply with applicable law; or (iv) are necessary or advisable for awards granted under the IPI either to be exempt from or comply with the requirements of Section 409A. 
              8. 
    Administration and Discretion  :  Except as otherwise required for Senior Officers under the Charter of the Compensation Committee or as otherwise expressly provided in the IPI, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Officer in charge of Human Resources or his/her delegate each have the discretion to: (a) adopt such rules, regulations, agreements and instruments as deemed necessary to administer the IPI; (b) interpret the terms of the IPI; (c) determine an employee s eligibility under the IPI; (d) determine whether a Participant is to receive a bonus award under the IPI; (e) determine the amount of any bonus award to a Participant, if any; (f) determine when a bonus award is to be paid to a Participant and whether any such bonus award should be prorated based on the Participant s service or other factors; (g) determine whether a bonus award will be made in replacement of or as an alternative to any other incentive or compensation plan of Intuit or of an acquired business unit or corporation; (h) grant waivers of IPI standard procedures and policies; (i) correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in the IPI, any bonus award or any notice to Participants or a Participant regarding bonus awards; and (j) take any and all other actions as deemed necessary or advisable for the proper administration of the IPI, including any actions deemed necessary or advisable for compliance with local laws. 
       
           9. 
    Participation Provides No Guarantee of Employment  :  Except where prohibited or to the extent limited by local law, employment at Intuit is at-will.  Participation in the IPI in no way constitutes an employment contract conferring either a right or obligation of continued employment. 
              10. 
    Nature of Participation; No Entitlement; No Claim for Compensation  :  The IPI is established voluntarily by Intuit Inc.; it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated as provided in Section 7 at any time.  Participants have no right or entitlement to compel Intuit to exercise its discretion in favour of a Participant or in any other manner.      Any payment of a bonus under the IPI is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of bonuses, or benefits in lieu thereof, even if bonuses have been granted under the IPI or similar plans repeatedly in the past.  All decisions with respect to any future bonus payments, if any, will be at the sole discretion of Intuit.   
     
   5 

Exhibit 10.47 

Participation in the IPI is voluntary.  Any bonus payment under the IPI is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to Intuit (including, as applicable, a Participant s employer) and which is outside the scope of a Participant s employment contract, if any.  Any bonus payment under the IPI is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, payment in lieu of notice, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments. 
    
  Governing Law  :  The IPI will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to choice of law principles of California or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to the IPI or any bonus award target or bonus award granted under the IPI shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in Santa Clara County in the State of California.

  To:    Dan Wernikoff, EVP and GM, Consumer Group 
  From:    Brad Smith, Chairman and CEO, Intuit Inc.        Date:    August 23, 2017 
  Re:     Living Expense Allowance 
  __________________________________________________________________ 
  In your role as EVP and GM of the Consumer Group based in San Diego, California, we appreciate that you will be required to incur additional expenses for your living expenses.  We understand that it is inconvenient to relocate your family at this time and therefore you will maintain your home in the Mountain View, California area while performing this job.  In order to offset those additional costs, the company will provide you with an expense allowance for those costs that you incur during the company s 2018 fiscal year.  This amount will be $9100 per month. 
  This amount will be paid to you in monthly installments during the course of the year. These amounts will be treated as taxable income to you.  The company will expect you to cover the costs of transportation between your home and your primary job location (except when you travel between your primary job location and the Bay Area for a business purpose) as well as accommodations and local transportation close to your primary job location while you are away from home out of this amount.  Other than this amount, the company will not reimburse you for any expenses of this type that you incur.  The company will evaluate during the 2018 fiscal year whether or not to continue this allowance in a future fiscal year. 
  Thank you for your commitment to the team and the business.
