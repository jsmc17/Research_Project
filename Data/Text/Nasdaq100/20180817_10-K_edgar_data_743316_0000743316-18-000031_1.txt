PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
    
  Overview 
    
  Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. ( Maxim Integrated  or the  Company  and also referred to as  we,   our  or  us ) designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of linear and mixed-signal integrated circuits, commonly referred to as analog circuits, for a large number of customers in diverse geographical locations. The analog market is fragmented and characterized by diverse applications, numerous product variations and, with respect to many circuit types, relatively long product life cycles. Our objective is to develop and market both proprietary and industry-standard analog integrated circuits that meet the increasingly stringent quality and performance standards demanded by customers. 
    
  We are a Delaware corporation originally incorporated in California in 1983. The mailing address for our headquarters is 160 Rio Robles, San Jose, California 95134, and our telephone number is (408) 601-1000. Additional information about us is available on our website at www.maximintegrated.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated into this Annual Report. 
    
  We have a 52-to-53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in June. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will be a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal year 2018 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal years 2017 and 2016 were each 52-week fiscal years. Fiscal year 2019 will be a 52-week fiscal year. 
    
  We make available through our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and any amendments to those reports or statements filed or furnished pursuant to the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. We also use our Investor Relations website at investor.maximintegrated.com as a routine channel for distribution of other important information, such as news releases, analyst presentations and financial information. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless we are required to do so by applicable laws. A copy of this Annual Report is available without charge and can be accessed at our website at investor.maximintegrated.com. 
    
  The Linear and Mixed-Signal Analog Integrated Circuit Market 
    
  All electronic signals generally fall into one of two categories, linear or digital. Linear (or analog) signals represent real world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, sound or speed, and are continuously variable over a wide range of values. Digital signals represent the  ones  and  zeros  of binary arithmetic and are either on or off. 
    
  Three general classes of semiconductor products arise from this distinction between linear and digital signals: 

digital devices, such as memories and microprocessors that operate primarily in the digital domain;  
                
    linear devices, such as amplifiers, references, analog multiplexers and switches that operate primarily in the analog domain; and  
                
    mixed-signal devices such as data converter devices that combine linear and digital functions on the same integrated circuit and interface between the analog and digital domains. 
       
  Our strategy has been to target both the linear and mixed-signal markets, often collectively referred to as the analog market. However, some of our products are exclusively or principally digital. While our focus continues to be on the linear and mixed-signal market, our capabilities in the digital domain enable development of new mixed-signal and other products with highly sophisticated digital characteristics.  
    
  Our linear and mixed-signal products serve five major end-markets: (i) Automotive, (ii) Communications and Data Center, (iii) Computing, (iv) Consumer and (v) Industrial. These major end-markets and their corresponding markets are noted in the table below:

Product Quality 
    
  We employ a system addressing quality and reliability of our products from initial design through wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and final shipment. We have received ISO 9001, IATF16949 and ISO 14001 certifications for all wafer fabrication, assembly, final test and shipping facilities. Based on industry standard requirements, we conduct reliability stress testing on the products we manufacture and sell. Through this testing, we can detect and accelerate the presence of defects that may arise over the life of a product.  
    
  Manufacturing 
    
  We primarily utilize third party foundries as well as our own wafer fabrication facilities for the production of our wafers. The broad range of products demanded by the analog integrated circuit market requires multiple manufacturing process technologies. As a result, many different process technologies are currently used for wafer fabrication of our products. The majority of processed wafers are also subject to parametric and functional testing at either our facilities or third-party vendors.  
    
  Historically, our internal wafer production occurred at one of our three owned wafer fabrication facilities at Beaverton, Oregon, San Jose, California and San Antonio, Texas. During fiscal year   2016  , we completed the closure of our San Jose facility, as well as the sale of our San Antonio facility to TowerJazz Texas, Inc. Production from both these sites was transferred to our other existing manufacturing locations and to our third-party service providers. The transfer of these activities from internal wafer production to third party foundries is part of our manufacturing transformation initiative ("manufacturing transformation"). 

5 

In fiscal year 2007, we entered into a supply agreement with Seiko Epson Corporation ( Epson ). In fiscal year 2010, we entered into a supply agreement with Powerchip Technology Corporation ( Powerchip ) to provide 300mm wafer capacity. In fiscal year 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with UMC Corporation ( UMC ). In fiscal year 2016, we entered into a supply agreement with TowerJazz Texas, Inc. (formerly known as TJ Texas, Inc.) ("TowerJazz"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Tower Semiconductor Ltd. In fiscal year 2018, we ramped production at our most recently added partner foundry, Fujitsu Ltd. ("Fujitsu"). Epson and Fujitsu in Japan and UMC and Powerchip in Taiwan manufacture products for us under rights and licenses using our proprietary technology. In fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , wafers manufactured by our partner foundries and merchant foundries (e.g., Taiwan Semiconductor Company Limited) represented   73%  ,   75%   and   57%  , respectively, of our total wafer manufacturing.  
    
  Once wafer manufacturing has been completed, wafers are sorted in order to determine which integrated circuits on each wafer are functional and which are defective. We currently perform the majority of wafer sorting, final testing and shipping activities at two company-owned facilities, located in Cavite, the Philippines and Chonburi Province, Thailand, although we also utilize independent subcontractors for some wafer sorting.  
    
  We process wafers for products that utilize chip scale packaging ( CSP ) also known as wafer level packaging ( WLP ). CSP, or WLP, enables integrated circuits to be attached directly to a printed circuit board without the use of a traditional plastic package. Historically, we utilized internal manufacturing resources as well as independent subcontractors to perform WLP manufacturing. In fiscal year 2016, we announced our intent to shut down our WLP manufacturing facility located in Dallas, Texas and completed this shutdown in fiscal year 2017. The manufacturing operations of the Dallas manufacturing facility were transferred to our Beaverton, Oregon factory and assembly subcontractors, which is also part of our manufacturing transformation. Currently, all WLP processes are done externally. 
    
  Integrated circuit assembly is performed by foreign assembly subcontractors, located in China, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea, where wafers are separated into individual integrated circuits and assembled into a variety of packages. 
    
  After assembly has been completed, a majority of the assembled products are shipped to our facilities located in Cavite, the Philippines or Chonburi Province, Thailand, where the packaged integrated circuits undergo final testing and preparation for customer shipment. In addition, we also utilize independent subcontractors to perform final testing. 
    
  The majority of our finished products ship directly from either Cavite, the Philippines or Chonburi Province, Thailand to customers worldwide or to other Company locations for sale to end-customers or distributors. 
    
  Customers, Sales and Marketing  
    
  We market our products worldwide through a direct-sales and applications organization and through our own and other unaffiliated distribution channels to a broad range of customers in diverse industries. Our products typically require a sophisticated technical sales and marketing effort. Our sales organization is divided into domestic and international regions. Distributors and direct customers generally buy on an individual purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term agreements. 
    
  Certain distributors have agreements with us which allow for certain sales price rebates or price adjustments on certain inventory if we change the price of those products. Certain distributor agreements also permit distributors to exchange a portion of certain purchases on a periodic basis. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products. 
    
  We derived approximately   47%   of our fiscal year   2018   revenue from sales made through distributors which includes distribution sales to Samsung and catalog distributors. Our primary distributor is Avnet Electronics ("Avnet") which accounted for   25%  ,   22%   and   19%   of our revenues in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. Avnet, like our other distributors, is not an end customer, but rather serves as a channel of sale to many end users of our products. Sales to Samsung, our largest single end customer (through direct sales and distributors), accounted for approximately   10%  ,   10%   and   14%   of net revenues in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. No single customer (other than Avnet and Samsung) nor single product accounted for   10%   or more of net revenues in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  . Based on customers  ship-to locations, international sales accounted for approximately   88%  ,   88%   and   89%   of our net revenues in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. See Note 11:  Segment Information  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report. 
    
  Seasonality 

6 

Our revenue is generally influenced on a quarterly basis by customer demand patterns and new product introductions. A large number of our products have been incorporated into consumer electronic products, which are subject to seasonality and fluctuations in demand. 
    
  Foreign Operations 

We conduct business in numerous countries outside of the United States ( U.S. ). Our international business is subject to numerous risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls, import and export controls, and other laws, policies and regulations of foreign governments. Refer to our discussion of risks related to our foreign operations as included in Item 1A, Risk Factors and our discussion of foreign income included in Item 7 under  Results of Operations  included in this Annual Report. Refer to net revenues from unaffiliated customers by geographic region included in Note 11:  Segment Information  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report. 
    
  Backlog 
    
  At   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  , our current quarter backlog was approximately   $441.1 million   and   $389.1 million  , respectively. Our current quarter backlog includes customer request dates to be filled within the next three months. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, these orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to customers. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog is not a reliable measure for predicting future revenues. All backlog numbers have been adjusted for estimated future distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments.  
    
  Research and Development 
    
  We believe that research and development is critical to our future competitiveness. Objectives for the research and development function include: 

new product definition and development of differentiated products;  
                
    design of products with performance differentiation that achieve high manufacturing yield and reliability;  
                
    development of, and access to, manufacturing processes and advanced packaging;  
                
    development of hardware, software, and algorithms to support the acceptance and design-in of our products in the end customer's system; and  
                
    development of high-integration products across multiple end markets. 
       
  Our research and development plans require engineering talent and tools for product definition, electronic design automation ( EDA ), circuit design, process technologies, test development, test technology, packaging development, software development and applications support. Research and development expenses were   $450.9 million  ,   $454.0 million   and   $467.2 million   in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.     See  Research and Development  under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information. 
    
  Competition 
    
  The linear and mixed-signal analog integrated circuit industry is intensely competitive, and virtually all major semiconductor companies presently compete with, or conceivably could compete with, some portion of our business.  
    
  We believe the principal elements of competition include: 

technical innovation; 
                
    service and support; 
                
    time to market; 
                
    business, operational, marketing and financial strategy; 
                
    differentiated product performance and features; 
                
    quality and reliability; 
                
    product pricing and delivery capabilities; 
                
    customized design and applications; 
                
    business relationship with customers; 
                
    experience, skill and productivity of employees and management; and

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business. 
    
  The sale of our products and our results of operations are dependent upon demand from the end markets of our customers, which is cyclical. 
    
  Our products are sold in the following major end-markets: (i) Automotive, (ii) Communications and Data Center, (iii) Computing, (iv) Consumer, and (v) Industrial. The demand for our products is subject to the strength of these five major end-markets that we serve and to some extent the overall economic climate. We often experience decreases and increases in demand for our products primarily due to the end-market demand of our customers. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if demand for our products decreases or if we are unable to meet an increase in demand without significantly increasing the lead-time for the delivery of our products. The semiconductor market historically has been cyclical with periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand. As a result, changes could have adverse effects on our results of operation. 
    
  Incorrect forecasts, reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products and volatility in customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations. 
    
  As is customary in the semiconductor industry, customer orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to the customers. Some customers place orders that require us to manufacture products and have them available for shipment, even though the customer may be unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the products. In other cases, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customer demands. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders, potentially leading to an initial inflation of backlog followed by a sharp reduction. Because of the possibility of order cancellation, backlog should not be used as a measure of future revenues. Furthermore, canceled or unrealized orders, especially for products meeting unique customer requirements, may also result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, some of which could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and results of operations. 
    
  We may experience difficulties implementing our new global execution system, which may adversely affect our ability to effectively supply products to our customers. 
    
  We are implementing a new global execution system ( GES ) as part of our efforts to integrate inventory movement with our financial reporting system. This implementation is a major undertaking and requires significant employee time and financial resources. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, implementation issues may arise. For example, we may experience staff turnover, which may delay the implementation of GES. Additionally, unforeseen issues may arise, which could disrupt the implementation of GES. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and the implementation or operation of GES could disrupt or reduce our supply chain execution and operational efficiency which may lead to our inability to effectively supply products to our customers. Our inability to successfully manage the implementation of GES could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  Our operating results may be adversely affected by our inability to timely develop new products through our research and development efforts. We may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products necessary to maintain or expand our business. 
    
  The marketplace for our products is constantly changing and we are required to make substantial ongoing investments in our research and development. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, variations in manufacturing efficiencies of new products, and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. New product introductions are a critical factor for maintaining or increasing future revenue growth and sustained or increased profitability. However, they can present significant business challenges because product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of the related revenues. The success of a new product depends on a variety of factors including accurate forecasts of long-term market demand and future technological developments, accurate anticipation of competitors' actions and offerings, timely and efficient completion of process design and development, timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, product performance, quality and reliability of the product, and effective marketing, revenue and service. 

9 

The loss of, or substantial reduction in sales to, any of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
    
  A reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our large customers may adversely affect our business. For example, sales to Samsung, our largest single end customer (through direct sales and distributors), accounted for approximately   10%  ,   10%   and   14%   of net revenues in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. The delay, significant reduction in, or loss of, orders from any one or more of our large customers (including curtailments of purchases due to a change in the design, manufacturing or sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer inventory adjustments) or demands of price concessions from any one or more of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and results of operations. 
    
  Our manufacturing operations may be interrupted or suffer yield problems. 
    
  The manufacture and design of integrated circuits is highly complex. We may experience a disruption in factory operations, manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields, or product delivery delays in the future as a result of, among other things, outdated infrastructure, upgrading or expanding existing facilities, equipment malfunctioning, construction delays, changing our process technologies, capacity constraints, or new technology qualification delays, particularly in our internal fabrication facilities. For example, our internal fabrication facility at Beaverton, Oregon requires additional investment to, among other things, upgrade its infrastructure and manufacturing equipment. In connection with the upgrading of our facilities, we may experience a disruption in factory operations, which could result in damages to the facilities and stoppages to the operations of the facilities. Additionally, our internal fabrication facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable due to damages resulting from fire, natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or other causes, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture our products for some period of time. 
    
  If our internal fabrication facilities become unavailable to us, it would be time consuming, difficult, and costly to arrange for new manufacturing facilities to supply our products given the nature of our products. In addition, our third party's manufacturing facilities may not be available to us due to natural or man-made disasters, labor unrest, political conditions or other causes. To the extent we experience disruptions at our wafer fabrication facilities or we do not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
    
  Our dependence on subcontractors for assembly, test, freight, wafer fabrication and logistic services and certain manufacturing services may cause delays beyond our control in delivering products to our customers. 
    
  We rely on subcontractors located in various parts of the world for assembly and CSP packaging services, freight and logistic services, wafer fabrication, and sorting and testing services. For example, in connection with the sale of our semiconductor wafer fabrication facility in San Antonio, Texas to TowerJazz Texas, Inc. (formerly known as TJ Texas, Inc.) ("TowerJazz"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Tower Semiconductor Ltd. ( Tower ), in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we entered into a long-term supply agreement with TowerJazz, pursuant to which we procure from TowerJazz certain quantities of silicon wafers upon which integrated circuits are made that are designed by us. None of the subcontractors we currently use are affiliated with us. Reliability problems experienced by our subcontractors or the inability to promptly replace any subcontractor could cause serious problems in delivery and quality resulting in potential product liability to us. Such problems could impair our ability to meet our revenue plan in the fiscal year period impacted by the disruption. Failure to meet the revenue plan may materially adversely impact our results of operations. 
    
  Any disruptions in our sort, assembly, test, freight, and logistic operations or in the operations of our subcontractors, including, but not limited to, the inability or unwillingness of any of our subcontractors to produce or timely deliver adequate supplies of processed wafers, integrated circuit packages, or tested products conforming to our quality standards, or other required products or services could damage our reputation, relationships, and goodwill with customers. Furthermore, finding alternate sources of supply or initiating internal wafer processing for these products may not be economically feasible. 
    
  If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business may be harmed. 
    
  Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our chief executive officer, our other executive officers, and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers and business unit managers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The loss of the services of one or several of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our Company. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected if the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increases significantly or we are unsuccessful in attracting, motivating and retaining qualified personnel. Should we lose one or more engineers who are key to a project's completion during the course of a particular  
  
   10 

project, the completion of such project may be delayed which could negatively affect customer relationships and goodwill and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
    
  Our critical information systems are subject to cyber-attacks, interruptions and failures. 
    
  We rely on several information technology systems to provide products and services, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, keep financial, employee, and other records, and operate other critical functions. These information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources. Security breaches, including cyber-attacks, phishing attacks or attempts to misappropriate or compromise confidential or proprietary information or sabotage enterprise information technology systems, are becoming increasingly frequent and more sophisticated. We currently have, and are in the process of developing several more, systems and procedures that include, among other things, ongoing internal risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities, an internal group dedicated to reviewing cybersecurity threats, and the adoption of an information security policy. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage networks and systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate protections. Despite our efforts to mitigate risks associated with cybersecurity events, our information technology systems may be susceptible to adaptive persistent threats, catastrophic cybersecurity attacks, damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer malware and viruses, telecommunication failures, user errors, or other events. Risks associated with these threats include, but are not limited to, loss of intellectual property, impairment of our ability to conduct our operations, disruption of our customers  operations, loss or damage to our customer data delivery systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate catastrophic cybersecurity events. A prolonged systemic disruption in the information technology systems could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant consequential costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, cybersecurity breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our customers, partners, suppliers, or employees which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage. 
    
  Our results of operations could be adversely affected by warranty claims and product liability. 
    
  We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability suits in connection with reliability problems or other product defects that may affect our customers. Our products are used by a variety of industries, including the automotive and medical industries. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to both the end product in which our device has been placed and to the user of such end product. Although we take measures to protect against product defects, if a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and any adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
    
  We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may impact our ability to compete effectively. 
    
  We rely upon know-how, trade secrets, and patents to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries generally do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States, and we may encounter problems in protecting our proprietary rights in those foreign countries. Periodically, we have been asked by certain prospective customers to provide them with broad licenses to our intellectual property rights in connection with the sale of our products to them. Such licenses, if granted, may have a negative impact on the value of our intellectual property portfolio. Other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we could be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling products that are alleged to be infringing, if such patents are valid and other design and manufacturing solutions are not available. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
    
  We may suffer losses and business interruption if our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others. 
    
  In the past, it has been common in the semiconductor industry for patent holders to offer licenses on reasonable terms and rates. Although the practice of offering licenses appears to be generally continuing, in some situations, typically where the patent directly relates to a specific product or family of products, patent holders have refused to grant licenses. In any of those cases, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any necessary license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or that we would be able to re-engineer our products or processes in a cost-effective manner to avoid claims of infringement. Any litigation in such a situation could involve an injunction to prevent the sales of a material portion of our products, the reduction or elimination of the value of related inventories and the assessment of a substantial monetary award for damages related to past sales, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

11 

We may experience losses related to intellectual property indemnity claims. 
    
  We provide intellectual property indemnification for certain customers, distributors, suppliers and subcontractors for attorney fees and damages and costs awarded against these parties in certain circumstances in which our products are alleged to infringe third party intellectual property rights, including patents, registered trademarks and copyrights. In certain cases, there are limits on and exceptions to our potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims. We cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments, if any, that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements. To date, we have not been required to pay significant amounts for intellectual property indemnification claims. However, there can be no assurance that we will not have significant financial exposure under those intellectual property indemnification obligations in the future. 
    
  Our independent distributors and sales representatives may underperform relative to our expectations, terminate their relationship with us or fail to make payments on outstanding accounts receivable to us, which would adversely affect our financial results. 
    
  A portion of our sales is realized through independent electronics distributors that are not under our direct control. These independent sales organizations generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could underperform for various reasons, including as a result of reducing their sales efforts applied to our products, or terminate their distribution relationship with us. In fiscal   2018  ,   47%   of our revenues were generated from distributors, the largest of which was Avnet, our primary world-wide distributor, which accounted for   25%   of our revenues. We require certain foreign distributors to provide a letter of credit to us in an amount up to the credit limit set for accounts receivable from such foreign distributors. The letter of credit provides for collection on accounts receivable from the foreign distributor should the foreign distributor default on their accounts receivable to us. Where credit limits have been established above the amount of the letter of credit, we are exposed for the difference. We do not require letters of credit from any of our domestic distributors and are not contractually protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors. The inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our or the distributor's initiative, or the general underperformance of a significant distributor could be disruptive and harmful to our current business. 
    
  Shortage of raw materials or supply disruption of such raw materials could harm our business. 
    
  The semiconductor industry has experienced a large expansion of fabrication capacity and production worldwide over time. As a result of increasing demand from semiconductor, solar and other manufacturers, availability of certain basic materials and supplies, and of subcontract services, has been limited from time to time over the past several years, and could come into short supply again if overall industry demand exceeds the supply of these materials and services in the future. 
    
  We purchase materials and supplies from many suppliers, some of which are sole-sourced. If the availability of these materials and supplies is interrupted, we may not be able to find suitable replacements. In addition, from time to time natural disasters can lead to a shortage of some materials due to disruption of the manufacturer's production. We continually strive to maintain availability of all required materials, supplies and subcontract services. However, we do not have long-term agreements providing for all of these materials, supplies and services, and shortages could occur as a result of capacity limitations or production constraints on suppliers that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our production requirements. 
    
  We may be liable for additional production costs and lost revenues to certain customers with whom we have entered into customer supply agreements if we are unable to meet certain product quantity and quality requirements. 
    
  We enter into contracts with certain customers whereby we commit to supply quantities of specified parts at a predetermined scheduled delivery date. The number of such arrangements continues to increase as this practice becomes more commonplace. Should we be unable to supply the customer with the specific part at the quantity and product quality desired and on the scheduled delivery date, the customer may incur additional production costs. In addition, the customer may lose revenues due to a delay in receiving the parts necessary to have the end-product ready for sale to its customers or due to product quality issues. Under certain customer supply agreements, we may be liable for direct additional production costs or lost revenues. If products are not shipped on time or are quality deficient, we may be liable for penalties and resulting damages. Such liability, should it arise, and/or our inability to meet these commitments to our customers may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could damage our relationships with the affected customers, reputation and goodwill. 
    
  If we fail to enter into future vendor managed inventory arrangements or fail to supply the specific product or quantity under such arrangements, the results of our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted. 

12 

We enter into arrangements with certain original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) and electronic manufacturing services ( EMS ) partners to consign quantities of certain products within proximity of the OEMs and EMS partners' manufacturing location. The inventory is physically segregated at these locations and we retain title and risk of loss related to this inventory until such time as the OEM or EMS partner pulls the inventory for use in its manufacturing process. Once the inventory is pulled by the OEM or EMS partner, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, at which point we relieve inventory and recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold. The specific quantities to be consigned are based on a forecast provided by the OEM or EMS partner. Generally, the arrangements with the OEMs and EMS partners provide for transfer of title and risk of loss once product has been consigned for a certain length of time. 
    
  We believe these arrangements will continue to grow in terms of number of customers and products and will increase in proportion to consolidated net revenues. Should we be unable or unwilling to enter into such agreements as requested by OEMs or EMS partners, our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted. In addition, should we be unable to supply the specific product in the quantity needed by the OEM or EMS partner as reflected in their forecast, we may be liable for damages, including, but not limited to, lost revenues and increased production costs which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Should we supply product in excess of the OEM or EMS partners' actual usage, any inventory not consumed may become excess or obsolete, which would result in an inventory write off that could materially adversely affect our results of operations. 
    
  Our products may fail to meet new industry standards or requirements and the efforts to meet such industry standards or requirements could be costly. 
    
  Many of our products are based on industry standards that are continually evolving. Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards. The emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major systems manufacturers. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards or requirements, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results. 
    
  Our operating results may be adversely affected by increased competition and consolidation of competitors in our market. 
    
  The semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years. As a result, we experience intense competition from a number of companies, some of which have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, and marketing resources than us, as well as greater technical resources and proprietary intellectual property rights than us. The principal elements of competition include product performance, functional value, quality and reliability, technical service and support, price, diversity of product line, and sale of integrated system solutions which combine the functionality of multiple chips on one chip for a price as part of a complete system solution and delivery capabilities. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, although we may be at a disadvantage in comparison to companies with broader product lines, greater technical service and support capabilities and larger research and development budgets. We may be unable to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors and our operating results may be adversely affected by increased competition or our inability to timely develop new products to meet the needs of our customers. 
    
  Extensions in lead-time for delivery of products could adversely affect our future growth opportunities and results of operations. 
    
  Supply constraints, which may include limitations in manufacturing capacity, could impede our ability to grow revenues and meet increased customer demands for our products. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to meet such increase in demand for our products without significantly increasing the lead-time required for our delivery of such products. Any significant increase in the lead-time for delivery of products may negatively affect our customer relationships, reputation as a dependable supplier of products and ability to obtain future design wins, while potentially increasing order cancellations, aged, unsaleable or otherwise unrealized backlog, and the likelihood of our breach of supply agreement terms. Any of the foregoing factors could negatively affect our future revenue growth and results of operations. 
    
  Our financial results may be adversely affected by increased tax rates and exposure to additional tax liabilities. 
    
  A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including, but not limited to: 

the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; 

13 

changes in our global structure that involve changes to investment in technology outside of the United States;  

the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities and, in particular, the outcome of the Internal Revenue Service audit of our tax returns for fiscal years 2009-2011 and fiscal years 2012-2014; 

changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;  

adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;  

increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;  

changes in available tax credits;  

changes in share-based compensation;  

changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, including laws or rules enacted by countries in response to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ( BEPS ) project conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD  and 

changes in generally accepted accounting principles. 
       
  We are subject to taxation in various countries and jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine tax liabilities on a worldwide basis. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
    
  We are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs on us and may adversely affect our business. 
    
  We are subject to numerous U.S. and international laws, rules and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters, including, but not limited to, data privacy and protection, environment, safety and health, exports and imports, bribery and corruption, tax, labor and employment, competition, market access, and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to operate our business. If we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to operate our business. 
    
  Among other laws and regulations, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation effective in the European Union, U.S. Customs and Export Regulations, including U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations and similar laws, which collectively control import, export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business.  
    
  While our Company s policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. If we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  Political conditions could materially affect our revenues and results of operations. 
    
  We are subject to the political and legal risks inherent in international operations. Exposure to political instabilities, different business policies and varying legal or regulatory standards, including, but not limited to, international trade disputes, could result in the imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions or barriers, which could impact economic activity and lead to a contraction of customer demand. International trade disputes could also result in various forms of protectionist trade legislation and other protectionist measures that could limit the Company s ability to operate its business and have a negative effect on end-market demand, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We have been impacted by these problems in the past, but none have materially affected our results of operations. Problems in the future or not-yet- 
  
   14 

materialized consequences of past problems could affect deliveries of our products to our customers, possibly resulting in substantially delayed or lost sales and/or increased expenses that cannot be passed on to our customers. 
    
  Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions. 
    
  The global economic environment could subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us, or delay paying us, for previously purchased products. Accordingly, reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of certain of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties. This would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers. 
    
  If economic or market conditions deteriorate globally, in the United States or in other key markets, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 
    
  Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could adversely impact our common stock price. 
    
  We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Our operating results have in the past been, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 

Fluctuations in demand for our products and services; 

Loss of a significant customer or significant customers electing to purchase from another supplier; 

Reduced visibility into our customers' spending plans and associated revenue; 

The level of price and competition in our product markets; 

Our pricing practices, including our use of available information to maximize pricing potential; 

The impact of the uncertain economic and credit environment on our customers, channel partners, and suppliers, including their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures; 

The overall movement toward industry consolidations among our customers and competitors; 

Below industry-average growth of the non-consumer segments of our business; 

Announcements and introductions of new products by our competitors; 

Our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders; 

Deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements (introduced by us or our competitors); 

Our ability to meet increases in customer orders in a timely manner; 

Striking an appropriate balance between short-term execution and long-term innovation; 

Our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and enhancements and market acceptance of such new products and enhancements; and 

Our levels of operating expenses. 
       
  Our stock price may be volatile. 
    
  The market price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
  
   15 

In addition, the market prices of securities of technology companies, including those in the semiconductor industry, generally have been and remain volatile. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. If our actual operating results or future forecasted results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results, the market price of our common stock may decline. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at a price equal to or higher than the price you paid for them. 
    
  Due to the nature of our compensation programs, some of our executive officers sell shares of our common stock each quarter or otherwise periodically, including pursuant to trading plans established under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Regardless of the reasons for such sales, analysts and investors could view such actions in a negative light and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected as a result of such periodic sales. 
    
  Material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. 
    
  Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. The review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill. A decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from, among other things, unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit, may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill. Our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. 
    
  Our debt covenants may limit us from engaging in certain transactions or other activities. 
    
  We have entered into debt arrangements that contain certain covenants which may limit the manner in which we conduct our business. For example, the debt indentures that govern our outstanding notes include covenants that, under certain circumstances, limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, which could limit our ability to secure additional debt funding in the future. In circumstances involving a change of control of the Company followed by a downgrade of the rating of the notes, we would be required to make an offer to repurchase the affected notes at a purchase price greater than the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our ability to repurchase the notes in such events may be limited by our then-available financial resources or by the terms of other agreements to which we are a party. Although we currently have the funds necessary to retire this debt, funds might not be available to repay the notes when they become due in the future. 
    
  We also have access to a revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that contains certain covenants which may limit the manner in which we conduct our business. For example, the credit agreement requires that we maintain a maximum debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense). We have no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. We may use the proceeds of any future borrowing under the credit facility for general corporate purposes, or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. 
    
  We are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our debt indentures and credit facility. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then, subject to cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. 
    
  Environmental, safety and health laws and regulations could force us to expend significant capital and incur substantial costs. 
    
  Various foreign and domestic federal, state, and local government agencies impose a variety of environmental, safety and health laws and regulations on the storage, handling, use, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals, gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Historically, compliance with these regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive or financial position. There can be no assurance, however, that interpretation and enforcement of current or future environmental, safety and health laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us. Any failure by us to adequately control the storage, handling, use, discharge or disposal of regulated substances could result in fines, suspension of production, alteration of wafer fabrication processes and legal liability, which may materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  Business interruptions from natural disasters could harm our ability to produce products. 
  
   16 

We operate our business in worldwide locations. Some of our facilities and those of our subcontractors are located in geologically unstable areas of the world and are susceptible to damage from natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, we may suffer a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our results of operations. 
    
  Our financial condition, operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected in the event of a catastrophic loss for which we are self-insured. 
    
  We are primarily self-insured with respect to many of our commercial risks and exposures. Based on management's assessment and judgment, we have determined that it is generally more cost effective to self-insure these risks. The risks and exposures we self-insure include, but are not limited to, fire, property and casualty, natural disasters, product defects, political risk, general liability, theft, counterfeits, patent infringement, certain employment practice matters and medical benefits for many of our U.S. employees. Should there be catastrophic loss from events such as fires, explosions, earthquakes, or other natural disasters, among many other risks, or adverse court or similar decisions in any area in which we are self-insured, our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. 
    
  We may pursue acquisitions and investments that could harm our operating results and may disrupt our business. 
    
  We have made and will continue to consider making strategic business investments, alliances, and acquisitions we consider necessary or desirable to gain access to key technologies that we believe will complement our existing technical capability and support our business model objectives. Investments, alliances, and acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact our future financial performance and result in an impairment of goodwill. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee. We may also need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions. 
    
  We also invest in early-to-late stage private companies to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. These strategic investments may not perform as expected. We cannot provide assurance that these companies will operate in a manner that will increase or maintain the value of our investment. If these private companies fail, we may not realize a return on our investments. Thus, all of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. 
    
  Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions. In addition, because acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. 
    
  Exiting certain product lines or businesses, or restructuring our operations, may adversely affect certain customer relationships and produce results that differ from our intended outcomes. 
    
  The nature of our business requires strategic changes from time to time, including restructuring our operations and divesting and consolidating certain product lines and businesses. The sale of facilities, or the exiting of certain product lines or businesses, may adversely affect certain customer relationships, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, our ability to timely shut down our facilities or otherwise exit product lines and businesses, or to close or consolidate operations, depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we are unable to shut down a facility or exit a product line or business in a timely manner, or to restructure our operations in a manner we deem to be advantageous, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if the sale of a facility or divestment is successful, we may face indemnity and other liability claims by the acquirer or other parties. 
    
  We may be materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations or changes in trade policies, including international trade disputes. 
    
  We conduct our manufacturing and other operations in various worldwide locations. A portion of our operating costs and expenses at foreign locations are paid in local currencies. Many of the materials used in our products and much of the manufacturing process for our products are supplied by foreign companies or by our foreign operations, such as our test operations in the Philippines and Thailand. Approximately   88%  ,   88%   and   89%   of our net revenues in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively, were from international sales. Accordingly, both manufacturing and sales of our products may be adversely affected by political or economic conditions abroad. In addition, various forms of protectionist trade legislation are routinely proposed in the United States and certain foreign countries. International trade disputes and changes in trade policies could result in the imposition of tariffs and  
  
   17 

trade restrictions, which could adversely affect our foreign manufacturing or marketing strategies and have a negative impact on end-market demand. Currency exchange fluctuations could also decrease revenue and increase our operating costs, the cost of components manufactured abroad, and the cost of our products to foreign customers, or decrease the costs of products produced by our foreign competitors. 
    
  Employee health benefit costs may negatively impact our profitability. 
    
  With a large number of employees participating in our health benefit plans, our expenses relating to employee health benefits are substantial. In past years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control, including, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. While we have attempted to control these costs in recent years, there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in controlling such costs in the future. Continued increases in health care costs, as well as changes in laws, regulations and assumptions used to calculate health and benefit expenses, may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. 
    
  Our certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a hostile change in control of our Company. 
    
  Our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors to authorize the issuance of up to   2,000,000   shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges and restrictions applicable to such shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Any such issuance might discourage, delay or prevent a hostile change in control of our Company, which may be considered beneficial to our stockholders.

These leases expire at various dates through   2030  . We anticipate no difficulty in retaining occupancy of any of our other manufacturing, office or sales facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month-to-month occupancy or in replacing them with equivalent facilities. 
    
  We expect these facilities to be adequate for our business purposes through at least the next   12   months. 

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are party or subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to intellectual property matters. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized or reserved, if any. 
    
  Indemnifications 

19 

We indemnify certain customers, distributors, suppliers, and subcontractors for attorney fees, damages, and costs awarded against such parties in certain circumstances in which our products are alleged to infringe third party intellectual property rights, including patents, registered trademarks, or copyrights. The terms of our indemnification obligations are generally perpetual from the effective date of the agreement. In certain cases, there are limits on and exceptions to our potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims. 
    
  Pursuant to our charter documents and separate written indemnification agreements, we have certain indemnification obligations to our current officers, employees, and directors, as well as certain former officers and directors.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
    
  The following table summarizes the activity related to stock repurchases for the three months ended   June 30, 2018  : 
  
   20 

On July 20, 2017, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to   $1.0 billion   of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors.  
    
  During fiscal year   2018  , we repurchased approximately   7.5 million   shares of our common stock for   $408.0 million  . As of   June 30, 2018  , we had a remaining authorization of   $618.4 million   for future share repurchases. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company's common stock and liquidity and general market and business conditions. 
    
  Stock Performance Graph 
    
  The line graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Composite Stock Index and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index for the five years ended   June 30, 2018  .

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part IV, Item 15(a), the risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A, and the  forward-looking statements  and other risks described herein and elsewhere in this Annual Report.    
    
  Overview 
    
  We are a global company with manufacturing facilities in the United States, the Philippines and Thailand, and sales offices and design centers throughout the world. We design, develop, manufacture and market linear and mixed-signal integrated circuits, commonly referred to as analog circuits, for a large number of customers in diverse geographical locations. The analog market is fragmented and characterized by diverse applications, a great number of product variations and, with respect to many circuit types, relatively long product life cycles. The major end-markets in which we sell our products are the automotive, communications and data center, computing, consumer and industrial markets. We are incorporated in the State of Delaware. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require us to make our most difficult and subjective accounting judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of net revenues; valuation of inventories, which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill, which impacts impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the income tax provision; and assessment of litigation and contingencies, which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and income taxes. These policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further below. We have other significant accounting policies that either do not generally require estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective, or it is less likely that such accounting policies would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  We recognize revenue for sales to direct customers and sales to distributors upon shipment, provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, title and risk of loss has transferred, collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured, there are no customer acceptance requirements and we do not have any significant post-shipment obligations. We estimate returns for sales to direct customers and distributors based on historical return rates applied against current period gross revenue. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered within this estimate. 
    
  Accounts receivable from direct customers and distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally transfers upon shipment, at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under normal terms. Accounts receivable related to consigned inventory is recognized when the customer takes title to such inventory from its consigned location, at which point inventory is relieved, title transfers, and we have a legally enforceable right to collection under the terms of our agreement with the related customers. 
    
  We estimate potential future returns and sales allowances related to current period product revenue. Management analyzes historical returns, changes in customer demand and acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of returns and sales allowances. Estimates made by us may differ from actual returns and sales allowances. These differences may materially impact reported revenue and amounts ultimately collected on accounts receivable. Historically, such differences have not been material. 
    
  An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is estimated based on our historical experience rates and also considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical experience rates. 
    
  The Company had historically recognized a portion of revenue through certain distributors at the time the distributor resold the product to its end customer (also referred to as the sell-through basis of revenue recognition) given the difficulty in estimating the ultimate price of these product shipments and amount of potential returns. The Company continuously reassesses its ability to  
  
   24 

reliably estimate the ultimate price of these products and the amount of potential returns and, over the past several years, has made investments in its systems and updates to processes around its distribution channel to improve the quality of the information for preparing such estimates. As a result of this continuous reassessment, the Company recognizes all revenue from distributors upon shipment to the distributor (also referred to as the sell-in basis of revenue recognition) as of second quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
    
  Inventories 
    
  Inventories are stated at the lower of (i) standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in-first-out basis, or (ii) net realizable value. Our standard cost revision policy is to monitor manufacturing variances and revise standard costs on a quarterly basis. Because of the cyclical nature of the market, inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we generally write-down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted product demand. Actual demand and market conditions may be lower than those projected by us. This difference could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin should inventory write-downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary. Alternatively, should actual demand and market conditions be more favorable than those estimated by us, gross margin could be favorably impacted as we release these reserves upon the ultimate product shipment. During fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , we had net inventory write-downs of   $21.4 million  ,   $19.0 million   and   $26.2 million  , respectively. When the Company records a write-down on inventory, it establishes a new, lower cost basis for that inventory, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances will not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. 
    
  Long-Lived Assets 
    
  We evaluate the recoverability of property, plant and equipment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 360,   Property, Plant, and Equipment   ( ASC 360 ). We perform periodic reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist that would indicate that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable. If facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable, we compare projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. In the event that the projected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets. Evaluation of impairment of property, plant and equipment requires estimates in the forecast of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our property, plant and equipment could differ from our estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
    
  Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
    
  We account for intangible assets in accordance with ASC No. 350,   Intangibles-Goodwill and Other   ( ASC 350 ). We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, such as when reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry are present.  
    
  Intangible asset reviews are performed when indicators exist that could indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the impaired asset is written down to fair value, which is typically calculated using: (i) quoted market prices or (ii) discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate consistent with the guidance provided in FASB Concepts Statement No. 7,   Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements.   Impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. 

25 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. As part of its analysis, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, as a result of the qualitative assessment, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. This test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. The Company generally determines the fair value of the Company's reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as the market approach which includes the guideline company method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment of goodwill measured as the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value with the loss recognized not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 
    
  Accounting for Income Taxes 
    
  We must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of income tax expense, determination of uncertain tax positions, and in the determination of whether deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. The calculation of our income tax expense and income tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. 
    
  ASC No. 740-10,   Income Taxes   ( ASC 740-10 ), prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement framework for financial statement reporting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, a tax position is recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. A tax position that meets the recognition threshold is then measured to determine the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Although we believe that our computation of tax benefits to be recognized and realized are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome will not be different from what was reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our net income and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. See Note 16:  Income Taxes  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report for further information related to ASC 740-10. 
    
  We evaluate our deferred tax asset balance and record a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the event it is determined that the deferred tax assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded. This adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future, an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination is made. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practicable tax planning strategies are considered. Realization of our deferred tax asset is dependent primarily upon future taxable income in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax asset and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period in which such determinations are made. 
    
  Litigation and Contingencies 
    
  From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or other intellectual property rights of others, notices of stockholder litigation or other lawsuits or claims against us. We periodically assess each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with ASC No. 450,   Contingencies   ( ASC 450 ), should be recorded. In making this determination, management may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. We expense legal fees associated with consultations and defense of lawsuits as incurred. Based on the information obtained, combined with management's judgment regarding all of the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether a contingent loss is probable and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated. Should a loss be probable and estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with ASC 450. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we take into consideration advice received from experts in the specific matter, the current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations which may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by management be incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. Alternatively, if the judgments and estimates made by management are incorrect and a particular contingent loss does not occur, the contingent loss recorded would be reversed thereby favorably impacting our results of operations. 

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth certain Consolidated Statements of Income data expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:  

The following table shows pre-tax stock-based compensation included in the components of the Consolidated Statements of Income reported above as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated: 

Net Revenues 
    
  We reported net revenues of   $2,480.1 million  ,   $2,295.6 million   and   $2,194.7 million   in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. Our net revenues in fiscal year   2018   increased by   8.0%   compared to our net revenues in fiscal year   2017  . Revenue from automotive products was up   17%  , primarily driven by increased demand for infotainment, battery management system products for electric vehicles, and driver assistance products. Revenue from industrial products was up   13%  , primarily due to higher sales of factory automation products and core industrial products. Revenue from consumer products was also up   5%  . The increase in revenue was also partially driven by the 53-week fiscal year 2018 compared to the 52-week fiscal year 2017.  

27 

Our net revenues in fiscal year   2017   increased by   4.6%   compared to our net revenues in fiscal year   2016  . Revenue from automotive products was up   18%  , primarily due to increased demand for infotainment products. Revenue from industrial products was up   4%  , primarily driven by shipments of factory automation products. Revenue from communications and data center products was up   3%  , due to higher shipments of data center products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from consumer products of   2%  , primarily due to lower shipments of smartphone products. Also, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 the Company began recognizing revenue with a certain distributor (less its estimate of future price adjustments and returns) upon shipment to the distributor (also referred to as the sell-in basis of revenue recognition). As a result of this change, the Company recognized an incremental   $19.4 million   of revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. 
    
  Approximately   88%  ,   88%   and   89%   of our net revenues in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively, were derived from customers located outside the United States, primarily in Asia and Europe. While less than   1.0%   of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on net revenues and our results of operations for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016   were immaterial.

  Our gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was   65.6%   in fiscal year   2018   compared to   63.0%   in fiscal year   2017  . Our gross margin increased by   2.6   percentage points, partially driven by implementation of cost reduction initiatives and improved factory utilization (2.3 percentage point increase to gross margin), and partially driven by lower intangible asset amortization and accelerated depreciation in fiscal year   2018   of   $3.9 million   (0.3 percentage point increase to gross margin).  
    
  Our gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was   63.0%   in fiscal year   2017   compared to   56.7%   in fiscal year   2016  . Our gross margin increased by   6.3   percentage points, partially driven by lower accelerated depreciation and intangible asset amortization in fiscal year   2017   of   $65.0 million   (3.1 percentage point increase to gross margin) and partially driven by improved factory utilization and cost reduction initiatives (3.2 percentage point increase to gross margin).  
    
  Research and Development 
    
  Research and development expenses were   $450.9 million   and   $454.0 million   for fiscal years   2018   and   2017  , respectively, which represented   18.2%   and   19.8%   of net revenues, respectively. The   $3.1 million   decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to our continued focused research and development investment strategy. 
    
  Research and development expenses were   $454.0 million   and   $467.2 million   for fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , respectively, which represented   19.8%   and   21.3%   of net revenues, respectively. The   $13.2 million   decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and related expenses of   $5.9 million   as a result of headcount reductions related to restructuring programs and spending control efforts. 
    
  The level of research and development expenditures as a percentage of net revenues will vary from period to period depending, in part, on the level of net revenues and on our success in recruiting the technical personnel needed for our new product introductions and process development. We view research and development expenditures as critical to maintaining a high level of new product introductions, which in turn are critical to our plans for future growth. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $322.9 million   and   $291.5 million   in fiscal years   2018   and   2017  , respectively, which represented   13.0%   and   12.7%   of net revenues, respectively. The   $31.4 million   increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $291.5 million   and   $288.9 million   in fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , respectively, which represented   12.7%   and   13.2%   of net revenues, respectively. The   $2.6 million   increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses of   $12.6 million   driven by increased employee profit sharing bonus, partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses. 
    
  The level of selling, general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of net revenues will vary from period to period, depending on the level of net revenues and our success in recruiting sales and administrative personnel needed to support our operations.  
    
  Impairment of Long-lived Assets 
  
   28 

Impairment of long-lived assets was   $0.9 million   in fiscal year   2018   and   $7.5 million   in fiscal year   2017  , which represented less than 0.1% and   0.3%   of net revenues, respectively. The   $6.6 million   decrease was primarily due to impairments of certain investments in privately held companies in fiscal year 2017. The Company uses various inputs to evaluate investments in privately held companies including valuations of recent financing events as well as other information regarding the issuer's historical and forecasted performance. The Company reached its conclusion regarding the asset impairment due to changes, during the fiscal year 2017, in the financial condition of certain investments in privately held companies which indicated an other than temporary impairment. 
    
  Impairment of long-lived assets was   $7.5 million   in fiscal year   2017   and   $160.6 million   in fiscal year   2016  , which represented   0.3%   and   7.3%   of net revenues, respectively. The   $153.1 million   decrease was primarily due to the classification of our wafer manufacturing facility in San Antonio, Texas as held for sale in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 which was written down to fair value, less cost to sell, resulting in an impairment of   $157.7 million  . 
    
  For further details of the asset impairments, please refer to Note 10:  Impairment of long-lived assets  in our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) to this Annual Report.  
    
  Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  There was   no   impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal year   2018  . 
    
  There was   no   impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal year   2017   and   $27.6 million   of impairment in fiscal year   2016  , which represented   1.3%   of fiscal year 2016 net revenues. This decrease was driven by a   $27.6 million   impairment during fiscal year 2016 of in-process research and development obtained in previous acquisitions, primarily from the acquisition of Volterra. 
    
  For further details on impairments recorded of goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 8:  Goodwill and intangible assets  in our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) to this Annual Report. 
    
  Severance and Restructuring Expenses  
    
  Severance and restructuring expenses were   $15.1 million   in fiscal year   2018   and   $12.5 million   in fiscal year   2017  , which represented   0.6%   and   0.5%   of net revenues, respectively. The   $2.6 million   increase was primarily due to employee enrollments in voluntary separation programs during fiscal year 2018. 
    
  Severance and restructuring expenses were   $12.5 million   in fiscal year   2017   and   $24.5 million   in fiscal year   2016  , which represented   0.5%   and   1.1%   of net revenues, respectively. The   $12.0 million   decrease was primarily due to the timing of restructuring activities initiated by the Company associated with continued reorganization of certain business units and functions and the closure of the Dallas wafer level packaging ( WLP ) manufacturing facilities. 
    
  For further details on our restructuring plans and charges recorded, please refer to Note 17:  Restructuring Activities  in our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) to this Annual Report. 
    
  Other Operating Expenses (Income), Net 
    
  Other operating expenses (income), net were   $(1.6) million   and   $(22.9) million   in fiscal year   2018   and   2017  , respectively, which represented   (0.1)%   and   (1.0)%   of net revenues, respectively. The net decrease in other operating income of   $21.3 million   was primarily driven by the gain of   $26.6 million   on the sale of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) business line in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
    
  Other operating expenses (income), net were   $(22.9) million   and   $(50.4) million   in fiscal year   2017   and   2016  , respectively, which represented   (1.0)%   and   (2.4)%   of net revenues, respectively. The net decrease in other operating income of   $27.5 million   was primarily driven by the gain of   $26.6 million   on the sale of our micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) business line recorded in fiscal year 2017 compared to the gain of   $58.9 million   on the asset sale of our energy metering business recorded in fiscal year 2016. 
    
  Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net 

29 

Interest and other income (expense), net was   $(8.6) million   in fiscal year   2018   and   $(15.2) million   in fiscal year   2017  , which represented   (0.3)%   and   (0.7)%   of net revenues, respectively. The decrease in interest and other expense of   $6.6 million   was primarily attributable to increased interest income on cash equivalents and short-term investments as well as net gains from derivatives hedging due to increased strength of the U.S. Dollar.  
    
  Interest and other income (expense), net was   $(15.2) million   in fiscal year   2017   and   $(28.8) million   in fiscal year   2016  , which represented   (0.7)%   and   (1.3)%   of net revenues, respectively. The decrease in interest and other expense of   $13.6 million   was primarily attributable to increased interest income on cash equivalents and short-term investments.  
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  Our annual income tax expense was   $357.6 million  ,   $108.0 million   and   $57.6 million   in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. The effective tax rate was   43.3%  ,   15.9%   and   20.2%   for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. Our federal statutory tax rate is   28.1%   for fiscal year   2018   and   35.0%   for fiscal years   2017   and   2016  .  
    
  On December 22, 2017 legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Act ) was enacted. The primary impacts of the Act in fiscal year 2018 are taxation of accumulated unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries ( Transition Tax ) and a reduction of our federal statutory tax rate from   35.0%   to   28.1%   (average of a   35.0%   rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a   21.0%   rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018). The Act allows us to pay the Transition Tax in eight annual interest-free installments beginning in September 2018, although for accounting purposes the Transition Tax was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Act has other provisions that will significantly impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019, including a further reduction of the federal statutory tax rate to   21.0%   and provisions that impact taxation of our international earnings.  
    
  Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 allowed the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if accounting for the income tax effects of the Act were not completed when our financial statements for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 were issued. Provisional amounts must be adjusted during the measurement period as accounting for income tax effects of the Act is completed. The measurement period began on December 22, 2017, the enactment date of the Act, and lasts no longer than one year. 
    
  To compute the Transition Tax, we must calculate accumulated unremitted earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries and the amount of foreign income taxes paid on those earnings. The Company made a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 recorded a provisional Transition Tax charge of   $236.9 million  , which consists of a   $248.0 million   Transition Tax liability less   $11.1 million   of deferred tax liabilities established in prior years for U.S. tax on unremitted foreign earnings. No adjustment to the provisional Transition Tax charge has been made as of the end of fiscal year 2018 as the Company continues to gather information and analyze available guidance to more precisely compute the Transition Tax. 
    
  Our fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to a   $236.9 million   provisional charge for the Transition Tax, a   $13.7 million   charge to remeasure deferred taxes at the enactment date of the Act to reflect the federal statutory rate reduction, and   $17.1 million   of interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and   $11.1 million   of excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards. 
    
  Our fiscal year 2017 effective tax rate was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and   $14.4 million   of excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by stock-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected and   $14.3 million   of interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. 
    
  Our fiscal year 2016 effective tax rate was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, partially offset by stock-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected,   $9.1 million   of interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and   $20.4 million   of non-deductible goodwill included in the sale of the energy metering business. 
    
  We have various entities domiciled within and outside the United States. The following is a breakout of our U.S. and foreign income (loss) before income taxes: 

30 

A relative increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, such as Ireland, may lower our consolidated effective tax rate, while a relative increase in earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, such as the United States, may increase our consolidated effective tax rate. 
    
  In fiscal year   2018   the percentage of pre-tax income from our foreign operations increased, which was primarily due a fiscal year   2017   gain from the sale of the Company s micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) business line that increased domestic pre-tax income. The impact of pre-tax income from foreign operations reduced our effective tax rate by   16.7   percentage points in fiscal year   2018   as compared to   20.2   percentage points in fiscal year   2017  . The rate reduction for foreign operations is the expected tax on foreign operations at the federal statutory tax rate less actual tax on foreign operations. The decreased fiscal year   2018   tax rate benefit from foreign operations was primarily due to a reduction of the Company s federal statutory tax rate from   35.0%   to   28.1%  . 
    
  In fiscal year   2017   the percentage of pre-tax income from our foreign operations declined versus fiscal year   2016  , which was primarily due to a   $157.7 million   fiscal year 2016 impairment of long-lived assets associated with the Company's wafer manufacturing facility in San Antonio, Texas that reduced domestic pre-tax income, partially offset by a   $24.1 million   fiscal year 2016 in-process research and development impairment charge realized by a foreign affiliate. The impact of pre-tax income from foreign operations reduced our effective tax rate by   20.2   percentage points in fiscal year 2017 as compared to   21.7   percentage points in fiscal year 2016. The decreased fiscal year 2017 tax rate benefit from foreign operations was primarily attributable to the relative decrease in fiscal year 2017 pre-tax income from foreign operations. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Refer to our discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements as included in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and financial statement schedules, Note 2:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Financial Condition 
    
  Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operating activities resulting from net income and management of working capital.  
    
  Cash flows were as follows: 

Operating Activities 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. 

31 

Cash provided by operating activities was   $819.5 million   in fiscal year   2018  , an increase of   $45.8 million   compared with fiscal year   2017  . This increase was primarily caused by an increase in income before provision for income taxes which resulted from higher revenue and improved gross margin.  
    
  Cash provided by operating activities was   $773.7 million   in fiscal year   2017  , an increase of   $51.8 million   compared with fiscal year   2016  . This increase was primarily driven by an increase in net income of   $344.1 million   driven by improved gross margin. This increase was offset by lower non-cash adjustments of   $158.7 million   of impairment of long-lived assets primarily related to the Company's wafer manufacturing facility in San Antonio, Texas in fiscal year 2016 and by lower non-cash adjustments of   $80.3 million   of depreciation and amortization charges.  
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases and maturities and acquisitions. 
    
  Cash used in investing activities was   $710.1 million   in fiscal year   2018  , an increase of   $384.7 million   compared with fiscal year   2017  . The change was primarily due to a   $997.2 million   increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a $678.2 million increase in proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities. 
    
  Cash used in investing activities was   $325.4 million   in fiscal year   2017  , an increase of   $388.1 million   compared with fiscal year   2016  . The change was primarily due to a   $350.2 million   increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities.  
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Financing cash flows consist primarily of new borrowings, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of notes payables, payment of dividends to stockholders, proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan and withholding tax payments associated with net share settlements of equity awards. 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $812.0 million   in fiscal year   2018  , an increase of   $504.6 million   compared with fiscal year   2017  . The Company issued   $500.0 million   of long-term debt in fiscal year   2017  . Changes in cash used in fiscal year   2018   included a $156.2 million increase in repurchases of common stock, and an increase of   $64.1 million   in dividend payments, partially offset by the repayment in fiscal year 2017 of   $250.0 million   of notes payable. 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $307.4 million   in fiscal year   2017  , an increase of   $77.0 million   compared with fiscal year   2016  . This increase was due primarily to the repayment in fiscal year 2017 of   $250.0 million   of notes payable and an increase of   $31.9 million   in dividend payments, partially offset by the issuance of   $500.0 million   of long-term debt in fiscal year 2017 compared to $250.0 million of short-term debt issued in fiscal year   2016  . 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  As of   June 30, 2018  , our available funds consisted of   $2.6 billion   in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. 
    
  Current portion of debt    
    
  On November 21, 2013, we completed a public offering of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of the Company's   2.5%   senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due on November 15, 2018 ( 2018 Notes ). 
    
  Available Borrowing Resources 
    
  We have access to a   $350 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on   June 27, 2019  . As of   June 30, 2018  , we had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility. 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at   June 30, 2018  , and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: 

32 

(1) We lease some facilities under non-cancelable operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through   2030  . 
  (2) Outstanding debt represents amounts primarily due for our long-term notes. 
  (3) Interest payments calculated based on contractual payment requirements under the debt agreements. 
  (4) We order some materials and supplies in advance or with minimum purchase quantities. We are obligated to pay for the materials and supplies when received. Additionally, in 2016 we entered into a long-term supply agreement with the semiconductor foundry TowerJazz to supply finished wafers on our existing processes and products, which contains minimum purchase requirements. 
  (5) Provisional Transition Tax on accumulated unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, paid interest free, over a period of eight years. 
    
  Purchase orders for the purchase of the majority of our raw materials and other goods and services are not included above. Our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements.  
    
  As of   June 30, 2018  , our gross unrecognized income tax benefits were   $591.5 million   which excludes   $61.9 million   of accrued interest and penalties.   At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments of these amounts, if any, in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing or outcomes of either actual or anticipated tax audits. As a result, these amounts are not included in the table above. 

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   June 30, 2018  , we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and notes payable. See Note 5:  Financial Instruments  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the ongoing risk of interest rate volatility. At   June 30, 2018  , we maintained a significant portfolio of money market fund investments, which are included in cash and cash equivalents. These money market funds are generally invested only in U.S. government or agency securities and are all available on a daily basis. Our short-term investments are in U.S. government, corporate and bank debt securities. Our long-term notes payable are all fixed rate securities and as such, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates related to these notes. 
    
  To assess the interest rate risk associated with our outstanding long-term debt portfolio, we performed sensitivity analysis for our long-term notes as of   June 30, 2018  , using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at   June 30, 2018  . The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates would result in a reduction in the fair values of our long-term notes of   $57.2 million  . 
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  
   33 

We generate less than   1.0%   of our revenues in various global markets based on orders obtained in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We incur expenditures denominated in non-U.S. currencies, primarily the Philippine Peso and the Thai Baht associated with our manufacturing activities in the Philippines and Thailand, respectively, and expenditures for sales offices and research and development activities undertaken outside of the U.S. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily on orders, cash flows for expenditures and accounts receivable from sales in these foreign currencies. We have established risk management strategies designed to reduce the impact of volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in the exchange rate for these currencies. These strategies reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. We routinely hedge our exposure to certain foreign currencies with various financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations. If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience financial losses.  
    
  For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under ASC No. 815,   Derivatives and Hedging   ( ASC 815 ), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings into the same financial statement line as the item being hedged, and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized each period in interest and other income (expense), net.  
    
  For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, gains and losses are recognized each period in interest and other income (expense), net. All derivatives are foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. The gains and losses on these derivatives largely offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. 
    
  As of   June 30, 2018  , we had outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts with a total notional amount of   $93.3 million  . If overall foreign currency exchange rates appreciated (depreciated) uniformly by   10%   against the U.S. dollar, our foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding as of   June 30, 2018   would experience an approximately   $4.8 million   gain (loss). 
    
  Foreign Exchange Contracts 
    
  The net unrealized gain or loss, if any, is potentially subject to market and credit risk as it represents appreciation (decline) of the hedge position against the spot exchange rates. The net realized and unrealized gains or losses from hedging foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities were immaterial during the fiscal years ended   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  .

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer ( CEO ) and our chief financial officer ( CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of   June 30, 2018  . These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on the evaluation, our CEO and our CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of   June 30, 2018  .  
    
  Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  
   34 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's CEO and CFO and effected by the Company's Board of Directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and our CFO, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of   June 30, 2018  . Management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting was conducted using the criteria in the   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013)     issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our management has concluded that, as of   June 30, 2018  , our internal control over financial reporting was effective, based on these criteria. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, as of   June 30, 2018  , as stated within their report which is included herein. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   June 30, 2018   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting and Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  A system of internal control over financial reporting is intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and no control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance. The design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect financial statement errors and misstatements. Also, projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. ( Maxim Integrated , the  Company,   we,   us  or  our ), incorporated in Delaware, designs, develops, manufactures, and markets a broad range of linear and mixed-signal integrated circuits, commonly referred to as analog circuits, for a large number of customers in diverse geographical locations. The Company also provides a range of high-frequency process technologies and capabilities for use in custom designs. The analog market is fragmented and characterized by diverse applications and a great number of product variations with varying product life cycles. Maxim Integrated is a global company with a manufacturing facility in the United States, testing facilities in the Philippines and Thailand, and sales and circuit design offices throughout the world. Integrated circuit assembly is performed by foreign assembly subcontractors, located in countries throughout Asia, where wafers are separated into individual integrated circuits and assembled into a variety of packages. The major end-markets the Company's products are sold in are the automotive, communications and data center, computing, consumer and industrial markets. 
    
  The Company has a 52-to-53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday of June. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth year will be a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal year   2018   was a 53-week fiscal year (ended on   June 30, 2018  ). Fiscal years   2017   and   2016   were each 52-week fiscal years (ended on   June 24, 2017  , and   June 25, 2016  , respectively). 

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to the useful lives and fair value of fixed assets, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, reserves relating to uncertain tax positions, allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and allowances, allowance for distributor credits, inventory valuation, reserves relating to litigation matters, assumptions about the fair value of reporting units, accrued liabilities and reserves, assumptions related to the calculation of stock-based compensation and the value of intangibles acquired and goodwill associated with business combinations. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and its beliefs of what could occur in the future, given available information. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments 
    
  The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand accounts, money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. Short-term investments consist primarily of U.S. treasury debt securities with original maturities beyond three months at the date of purchase, agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. 
    
  The Company's short-term investments are considered available-for-sale and classified as short-term as these investments generally consist of highly marketable securities that are available to meet near-term cash requirements. Such securities are carried at fair market value based on market quotes and other observable inputs. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on securities in this category are reported as equity in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Realized gains and losses on sales of investment securities are determined based on the specific identification method and are included in Interest and other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

    MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Derivative Instruments 
    
  The Company incurs expenditures denominated in non-U.S. currencies, primarily the Philippine Peso and the Thai Baht associated with the Company's manufacturing activities in the Philippines and Thailand, respectively, and European Euro, Indian Rupee, Taiwan New Dollar, South Korean Won, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Singapore Dollar, and Canadian Dollar expenditures for sales offices and research and development activities undertaken outside of the U.S. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for cash flows for expenditures and on orders and accounts receivable from sales in these foreign currencies. The Company has established risk management strategies designed to reduce the impact of volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in the exchange rate for these currencies. These strategies reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rates movements. 
    
  Currency forward contracts are used to offset the currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated assets and liabilities. The Company typically enters into currency forward contracts to hedge exposures associated with its expenditures denominated in European Euro, Philippine Peso and South Korean Won. The Company also hedges smaller expense exposures in several other foreign currencies. The Company enters into currency forward contracts to hedge its accounts receivable and backlog denominated in European Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. Changes in fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities are generally offset by the changes in fair value of the related currency forward contract. 
    
  The Company uses currency forward contracts to hedge exposure to variability in anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair market value. The maturities of these instruments are generally less than   six months  . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reported within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. These amounts have been reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, gains and losses are recognized immediately in  Interest income (expense) and other, net  in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. 
    
  Inventories 
    
  Inventories are stated at the lower of (i) standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in-first-out basis, or (ii) net realizable value. The Company's standard cost revision policy is to monitor manufacturing variances and revise standard costs on a quarterly basis. Because of the cyclical nature of the market, inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, the Company generally writes down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted product demand. 
    
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
    
  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is primarily computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from   2   to   15   years for machinery, equipment and software and up to   40   years for buildings and building improvements. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the related lease. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The classification is based mainly on whether the asset is operating or not. 
    
  The Company evaluates the recoverability of property, plant and equipment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 360,   Property, Plant, and Equipment   ( ASC 360 ). The Company performs periodic reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist that would indicate that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are not recoverable and exceed their fair values. If facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable, projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining useful lives are compared against their respective carrying amounts. In the event that the projected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on their expected discounted future cash flows attributable to those assets. All long-lived assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair market value, less expected selling costs. 
  
   45 

    MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
    
  The Company accounts for intangible assets in accordance with ASC No. 350,   Intangibles-Goodwill and Other   ( ASC 350 ). The Company reviews goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, such as when reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry are present.  
    
  Intangible asset reviews are performed when indicators exist that could indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the impaired asset is written down to fair value, which is typically calculated using: (i) quoted market prices or (ii) discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate consistent with the guidance provided in FASB Concepts Statement No. 7,   Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements  . Impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. 
    
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-3, the Company's performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, as a result of the qualitative assessment, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. This test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. The Company determines the fair value of the Company's reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as the market approach which includes the guideline company method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment of goodwill measured as the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value with the loss recognized not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 
    
  Product Warranty 
    
  The Company generally warrants its products for one year from the date of shipment against defects in materials, workmanship and material non-conformance to the Company s specifications. The general warranty policy provides for the repair or replacement of defective products or a credit to the customer s account. In addition, the Company may consider its relationship with the customer when reviewing product claims. In limited circumstances and for strategic customers in certain unique industries and applications, the Company's product warranty may extend for up to five years, and may also include financial responsibility, such as the payment of monetary compensation to reimburse a customer for its financial losses above and beyond repairing or replacing the product or crediting the customer s account should the product not meet the Company s specifications and losses and/or damages result from the defective product. 
    
  Accruals are based on specifically identified claims and on the estimated, undiscounted cost of incurred-but-not-reported claims. If there is a material increase in the rate of customer claims compared with the Company's historical experience or if the Company's estimates of probable losses relating to specifically identified warranty exposures require revision, the Company may record a charge against future cost of sales. The short-term and long-term portions of the product warranty liability are included within the balance sheet captions Accrued expenses and Other liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Retirement Benefits 
    
  The Company provides medical benefits to certain former and current employees pursuant to certain retirement agreements. The Company also provides retirement benefits to Philippines employees and to certain other employees in other countries. These benefits to individuals are accounted for pursuant to a documented plan under ASC No. 715,   Compensation-Retirement Benefits   ( ASC 715 )  .   Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated service period of participants. The measurement date for the plan is fiscal year end.

    MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Income Taxes 
    
  The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach as prescribed in ASC No. 740-10,   Income Taxes   ( ASC 740-10 ). The Company records the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current and prior years and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. 
    
  ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement framework for the financial statement reporting and disclosure of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, a tax position is recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. A tax position that meets the recognition threshold is then measured to determine the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although ASC 740-10 provides clarification on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements, the recognition threshold and measurement framework will continue to require significant judgment by management. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the Company's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  The Company recognizes revenue for sales to direct customers and sales to distributors upon shipment, provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, title and risk of loss has transferred, collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured, there are no customer acceptance requirements and the Company does not have any significant post-shipment obligations. Estimated returns for sales to direct customers and distributors are based on historical returns rates applied against current period gross revenues. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered within this estimate. 
    
  Accounts receivable from direct customers and distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally transfers upon shipment, at which point the Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under normal terms. Accounts receivable related to consigned inventory is recognized when the customer takes title to such inventory from its consigned location, at which point inventory is relieved, title transfers, and the Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under the terms of the Company's agreement with the related customers. 
    
  The Company estimates potential future returns and sales allowances related to current period product revenue. Management analyzes historical returns, changes in customer demand and acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of returns and sales allowances. Estimates made by the Company may differ from actual returns and sales allowances. These differences may materially impact reported revenue and amounts ultimately collected on accounts receivable. Historically, such differences have not been material. 
    
  An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is estimated based on our historical experience rates and also considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claim activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical experience rates. 
    
  The Company had historically recognized a portion of revenue through certain distributors at the time the distributor resold the product to its end customer (also referred to as the sell-through basis of revenue recognition) given the difficulty in estimating the ultimate price of these product shipments and amount of potential returns. The Company continuously reassesses its ability to reliably estimate the ultimate price of these products and the amount of potential returns and, over the past several years, has made investments in its systems and updates to processes around its distribution channel to improve the quality of the information for preparing such estimates. As a result of this continuous reassessment, the Company recognizes all revenue from distributors upon shipment to the distributor (also referred to as the sell-in basis of revenue recognition) as of second quarter of fiscal year 2018.

  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards ultimately expected to vest and is recognized as an expense, on a straight-line basis, over the requisite service period. ASC No. 718,   Compensation-Stock Compensation,   allows forfeitures to be either expensed as incurred or estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures or vesting differ from those estimates. The Company has elected to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and update if necessary. Such updates could have a material effect on the Company's operating results.  
    
  The Company uses the Monte Carlo simulation model to measure the fair value of its market stock units on the date of grant. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis. 
    
  Restructuring 
    
  Post-employment benefits accrued for workforce reductions related to restructuring activities in the United States are accounted for under ASC No. 712,   Compensation-Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits  . A liability for post-employment benefits is recorded when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. In accordance with ASC No. 420,   Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations  , generally costs associated with restructuring activities initiated outside the United States have been recognized when they are incurred. 
    
  The Company continually evaluates the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under its restructuring initiatives. Although the Company believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of its restructuring plans, actual results may differ, thereby requiring the Company to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions. 
    
  Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement 
    
  The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company's foreign operations. Using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the year-end exchange rates. Certain non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using historical rates. Consolidated Statements of Income are remeasured at the average exchange rates during the year. Foreign exchange gains and losses as recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented were not material. 
    
  Earnings Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share incorporate the potentially dilutive incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and market stock units, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. The number of incremental shares from the assumed issuance of stock options is calculated by applying the treasury stock method.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

From time to time, the Company receives notices that its products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or other intellectual property rights of others, notices of stockholder litigation or other lawsuits or claims against the Company. The Company periodically assesses each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with ASC No. 450,   Contingencies   ("ASC 450") should be recorded. In making this determination, management may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. The Company expenses legal fees associated with consultations and defense of lawsuits as incurred. Based on the information obtained, combined with management's judgment regarding all of the facts and circumstances of each matter, the Company determines whether a contingent loss is probable and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated. Should a loss be probable and estimable, the Company records a contingent loss in accordance with ASC No. 450. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, the Company takes into consideration advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations which may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by management be incorrect, the Company may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact its results of operations. Alternatively, if the judgments and estimates made by management are incorrect and a particular contingent loss does not occur, the contingent loss recorded would be reversed thereby favorably impacting the Company's results of operations. 
    
  Pursuant to the Company's charter documents and separate written indemnification agreements, the Company has certain indemnification obligations to its current officers and directors, as well as certain former officers and directors. The indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the Company will indemnify each of its directors and officers, under the circumstances and to the extent provided therein, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines, and settlements each may be required to pay in actions or proceedings to which he or she may be made a party by reason of his or her position or positions as a director, officer or other agent of the Company, and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and the Company s bylaws. 
    
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
    
  Due to the Company's credit evaluation and collection process, bad debt expenses have not been significant. Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company's customer base, thus spreading the credit risk. The Company derived approximately   47%   of its fiscal year   2018   revenue from sales made through distributors which includes distribution sales to Samsung and catalog distributors. The Company's primary distributor is Avnet Electronics ( Avnet ). Avnet, like the Company's other distributors, is not an end customer, but rather serves as a channel of sale to many end users of the Company's products. Avnet accounted for   25%  ,   22%   and   19%   of revenues in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively, and   22%   and   22%   of accounts receivable as of   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  , respectively. Sales to Samsung, the Company's largest single end customer (through direct sales and distributors), accounted for approximately   10%  ,   10%   and   14%   of net revenues in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively, and   12%   and   11%   of accounts receivable as of   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  , respectively. No other customer accounted for   10%   or more of the Company's revenues in the fiscal years   2018  ,   2017  , and   2016  . No other customer accounted for   10%   or more of the Company's accounts receivable as of   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  . 
    
  The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments with various high credit quality financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or instrument, and is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by these institutions to the extent of amounts recorded at the balance sheet date. To date, the Company has not incurred losses related to these investments. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  (i) New Accounting Updates Recently Adopted 
    
  In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)  , which is intended to improve accounting for hedging activities by expanding and refining hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and aligning the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements. The Company early-adopted ASU 2017-12 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. There was no material change to the Company's consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption. This adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior periods. 
    
  (ii) Recent Accounting Updates Not Yet Effective  
    
  In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This ASU largely aligns the accounting for share-based payment awards to employees and non-employees. Under the new guidance, both sets of awards, for employees and non-employees, will essentially follow the same  
  
   49 

    MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

model, with small discrepancies related to the term assumption when valuing non-employee awards. The new standard is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02,   Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)  . This standard provides guidance about the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ASU 2018-02 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company does not believe the implementation of this standard will result in a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Scope of Modification Accounting  . The amendments in this standard provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this standard are effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company does not believe the implementation of this standard will result in a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07,   Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost  , which requires employers that offer or maintain defined benefit plans to disaggregate the service component from the other components of net benefit cost and provides guidance on presentation of the service component and the other components of net benefit cost in the statement of operations. The new standard is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-06,   Plan Accounting: Defined Benefit Pension Plans (Topic 960); Defined Contribution Pension Plans (Topic 962); Health and Welfare Benefit Plans (Topic 965) - Employee Benefit Plan Master Trust Reporting  . This update provides guidance for reporting by an employee benefit plan for its interest in a master trust. The guidance is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 on a retrospective basis, with early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  . ASU 2016-16 requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs instead of when the asset is sold. ASU No. 2016-16 is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe the implementation of this standard will result in a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which supersedes the lease accounting requirements in Topic 840. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The guidance also requires qualitative and specific quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. This guidance is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 on a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10) - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , with further classifications made recently with the issuance of ASU 2018-03 and ASU 2018-04, which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. This ASU will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The application of this ASU will be by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) will be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . This standard provides a single set of guidelines for revenue recognition to be used across all industries and requires additional disclosures. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09. The Company has selected the modified retrospective transition method. The Company's assessment of the impact of this standard is substantially complete and the Company currently expects no material impact to the timing of revenue recognition upon adoption. There will be a material reclass of reserves from the allowance for accounts receivable to current liabilities as well as additional disclosure under this guidance, including more information regarding estimates, judgments, and practical expedients used.

NOTE 4: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  The FASB established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: 
    
  Level 1   - Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
    
  The Company's Level 1 assets consist of money market funds. 
    
  Level 2   - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  
    
  The Company s Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and foreign currency forward contracts that are valued using quoted market prices or are determined using a yield curve model based on current market rates. 
    
  Level 3   - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
    
  The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities consist of contingent consideration liabilities as of   June 30, 2018   related to an acquisition. The Company did not hold any Level 3 assets or liabilities as of   June 24, 2017  . 
    
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In the fiscal years ended   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  , the Company did not recognize any impairment charges on short-term investments. The U.S. Treasury securities have maturity dates between July 15, 2018 and June 15, 2019.  
  Derivative instruments and hedging activities  
    
  In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company early-adopted ASU 2017-12, which is intended to improve accounting for hedging activities by expanding and refining hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and aligning the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements. There was no material change to the Company's consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption. This adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior periods. 
    
  The Company incurs expenditures denominated in non-U.S. currencies, primarily the Philippine Peso and the Thai Baht associated with the Company's manufacturing activities in the Philippines and Thailand, respectively, and European Euro, Indian Rupee, Taiwan New Dollar, South Korean Won, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Singapore Dollar, and Canadian Dollar expenditures for sales offices and research and development activities undertaken outside of the U.S. 
    
  The Company has established a program that exclusively utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. The Company does not use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes.  
    
  Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments 
    
  The Company designates certain forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC No. 815,   Derivatives and Hedging   ( ASC 815 ). As of   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  , respectively, the notional amounts of the forward contracts the Company held to purchase international currencies were   $49.7 million   and   $36.2 million  , respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts the Company held to sell international currencies were   $1.2 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively.  
    
  Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 
    
  As of   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  , respectively, the notional amounts of the forward contracts the Company held to purchase international currencies were   $21.1 million   and   $44.5 million  , respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts the Company held to sell international currencies were   $21.3 million   and   $21.6 million  , respectively. The fair values of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts and gain (loss) included in the Consolidated Statements of Income were not material for the fiscal years ended   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  .

Outstanding debt obligations 
  The following table summarizes the Company's outstanding debt obligations: 

On June 15, 2017, the Company completed a public offering of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of the Company's   3.450%   senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in June 2027 ( 2027 Notes ), with an effective interest rate of   3.5%  . Interest on the 2027 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2017. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately   $495.2 million  , after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses. 
    
  On November 21, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of the Company s   2.5%   coupon senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in November 2018 ( 2018 Notes ), with an effective interest rate of   2.6%  . Interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2014. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately   $494.5 million  , after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses. 
    
  On   March 18, 2013  , the Company completed a public offering of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of the Company's   3.375%   senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in March 2023 ( 2023 Notes ), with an effective interest rate of   3.5%  . Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately   $490.0 million  , after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses. 
    
  The debt indentures that govern the 2027 Notes, the 2023 Notes and the 2018 Notes, respectively, include covenants that limit the Company's ability to grant liens on its facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, which could limit the Company's ability to secure additional debt funding in the future. In circumstances involving a change of control of the Company followed by a downgrade of the rating of the 2027 Notes, the 2023 Notes or the 2018 Notes, the Company would be required to make an offer to repurchase the affected notes at a purchase price equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
    
  The Company accounts for all the notes above based on their amortized cost. The discount and expenses are being amortized to Interest and other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the life of the notes. The interest expense is recorded in Interest and other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Amortized discount and expenses,

as well as interest expense associated with the notes was   $49.5 million  ,   $31.7 million   and   $29.4 million   during the years ended   June 30, 2018  ,   June 24, 2017  , and   June 25, 2016  , respectively.  
    
  The estimated fair value of the Company's outstanding debt obligations was approximately   $1,470 million   as of   June 30, 2018  . The estimated fair value of the debt is based primarily on observable market inputs and is a Level 2 measurement. 
    
  The Company recorded interest expense of   $50.2 million  ,   $34.3 million  , and   $32.7 million   during the fiscal years ended   June 30, 2018  ,   June 24, 2017  , and   June 25, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Credit facilities 
  Revolving credit facility 
    
  The Company has access to a   $350 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on   June 27, 2019  . The facility fee is at a rate per annum that varies based on the Company's index debt rating and any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at a base rate plus a margin based on the Company's index debt rating. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of not more than   3     to   1   and a minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) greater than   3.5   to   1  . As of   June 30, 2018  , the Company had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility and was in compliance with all debt covenants. 
    
  Other financial instruments 
    
  For the balance of the Company's financial instruments, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. 

NOTE 6: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  At   June 30, 2018  , the Company had one stock incentive plan, the Company's 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the  1996 Plan ) and one employee stock purchase plan, the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  2008 ESPP ). The 1996 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors to provide the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock units ( RSUs ), and market stock units ( MSUs ) to employees, directors, and consultants.  
    
  Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options is determined to be the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Options typically vest ratably over a four-year period measured from the date of grant. Options generally expire no later than seven years after the date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon an optionee's cessation of employment or service.  
    
  RSUs granted to employees typically vest ratably over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period. RSU granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements. 
    
  MSUs granted to employees typically vest over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period. The number of shares that are released at the end of the performance period can range from zero to a maximum cap depending on the Company's performance. For MSUs granted prior to September 2017, the performance metrics of this program are based on relative performance of the Company s stock price as compared to the Semiconductor Exchange Traded Fund index SPDR S P (the  XSD ). For MSUs granted in September 2017, the performance metrics for this program are based on the total shareholder return ("TSR") of the Company relative to the TSR of the other companies included in the XSD; these MSUs vest based upon annual performance subject to continued service through the end of the four-year cliff period. MSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements. 
    
  The following tables show total stock-based compensation expense by type of award, and the resulting tax effect, included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  :

The fair value of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ) and other awards under the Company s 1996 Plan is estimated using the value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company s common stock prior to vesting. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis.  
    
  The weighted average fair value of RSUs and other awards granted was   $44.95  ,   $37.33   and   $29.75   per share for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. 
    
  The following table summarizes outstanding and expected to vest RSUs and other awards as of   June 30, 2018   and their activity during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  : 

(1) Aggregate intrinsic value for RSUs and other awards represents the closing price per share of the Company's common stock on June 29, 2018, the last business day preceding the fiscal year end, multiplied by the number of RSUs and other awards outstanding, or expected to vest as of   June 30, 2018  . 
    
  The Company withheld shares totaling   $30.3 million   in value as a result of employee withholding taxes based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2018  . The total payments for the employees' tax obligations to the taxing authorities are reflected as financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
    
  As of   June 30, 2018  , there was   $140.5 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to   5.5 million   unvested RSUs and other awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   2.6   years.

Market Stock Units 
    
  The Company grants MSUs to senior members of management in lieu of granting stock options. For MSUs granted prior to September 2017, the performance metrics of this program are based on relative performance of the Company s stock price as compared to the Semiconductor Exchange Traded Fund index SPDR S P (the  XSD ). For MSUs granted in September 2017, the performance metrics for this program are based on the total shareholder return ("TSR") of the Company relative to the TSR of the other companies included in the XSD. The fair value of MSUs is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis. Compensation expense is recognized based on the initial valuation and is not subsequently adjusted as a result of the Company s performance relative to that of the XSD or the TSR of the companies included in the XSD, as applicable. Vesting for MSUs is contingent upon both service and market conditions and has a four-year vesting cliff period. MSUs granted in September 2017 vest based upon annual performance and are subject to continued service through the end of the four-year period, but will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements. 
    
  The weighted-average fair value of MSUs granted was   $51.03  ,   $37.29   and   $29.64   per share for the per share for fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. 
    
  The following table summarizes the number of MSUs outstanding and expected to vest as of   June 30, 2018   and their activity during fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016  : 

(1) Aggregate intrinsic value for MSUs represents the closing price per share of the Company s common stock on June 29, 2018, the last business day preceding the fiscal quarter-end, multiplied by the number of MSUs outstanding or expected to vest as of   June 30, 2018  . 
    
  As of   June 30, 2018  , there was   $21.6 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to   1.1 million   unvested MSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   2.6   years.  
    
  At   June 30, 2018  , the Company had   22.1 million   shares of its common stock available for issuance to employees and other recipients under the 1996 Plan.

As of   June 30, 2018  , the Company had   7.2 million   shares of its common stock reserved and available for future issuance under the 2008 ESPP. 
    
  The fair value of shares granted to employees under the 2008 ESPP in fiscal years   2018  ,   2017   and   2016   has been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model using the following assumptions for the offering periods outstanding:  

As of   June 30, 2018  , there was   $5.8 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to the 2008 ESPP. 

NOTE 7: EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For purposes of computing basic earnings (loss) per share, the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock excludes unvested RSUs and other awards as well as MSUs. Diluted earnings (loss) per share incorporates the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options, assumed release of unvested RSUs and other awards as well as MSUs, and assumed issuance of common stock under the 2008 ESPP using the treasury stock method.  
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share: 

For the fiscal years ended   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  ,   no   stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Approximately   0.5 million   stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended   June 25, 2016  . These options were excluded because they were determined to be antidilutive.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions, by reporting unit, annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
    
  Fiscal Year 2018 
    
  In fiscal year   2018  , the Company elected to perform a qualitative analysis to assess impairment of goodwill rather than to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The key qualitative factors considered in the assessment included the change in the industry and competitive environment, market capitalization, and overall financial performance. Based on the results of this qualitative analysis, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and therefore, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired in fiscal year   2018  . 
    
  Fiscal Year 2017 
    
  In fiscal year   2017  , the Company performed a qualitative analysis to assess impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter and concluded that goodwill was not impaired, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. No indicators or instances of impairment were identified during fiscal year   2017  . 
    
  Activity and goodwill balances for the fiscal years ended   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017   were as follows:

A reconciliation of the Company's Federal statutory tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate is as follows:

    MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

On December 22, 2017 legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Act ), was enacted. The primary impact of the Act in fiscal year 2018 are taxation of accumulated unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries ("Transition Tax") and a reduction of our federal statutory tax rate from   35.0%   to   28.1%   (average of a   35.0%   rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a   21.0%   rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018). Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 allowed the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if accounting for the income tax effects of the Act have not been completed. Provisional amounts must be adjusted within one year from the enactment date of the Act. To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, we must calculate the accumulated unremitted earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries and the amount of foreign income tax paid on such earnings. The Company made a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 recorded a provisional Transition Tax charge of   $236.9 million  , which consists of a   $248.0 million   Transition Tax liability less   $11.1 million   of deferred tax liabilities established in prior years for U.S. tax on unremitted foreign earnings. No adjustment to the provisional Transition Tax charge has been made as of the end of fiscal year 2018 as the Company continues to analyze available guidance to more precisely compute the Transition Tax. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 the Company recorded a   $13.7 million   charge to remeasure deferred taxes as of the enactment date of the Act to reflect the federal statutory rate reduction. 
    
  The Act contains Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI ) rules, which first impact the Company in fiscal year 2019. Under the GILTI rules certain income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries is subject to current U.S. taxation. The Company is continuing to evaluate this provision of the Act and the application of ASC 740. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is permitted to make an accounting policy election to either treat future U.S. tax generated by the GILTI rules as a current-period expense when incurred or to factor such amounts into the Company's measurement of its deferred taxes. The Company has not recorded any amounts related to potential GILTI tax in its financial statements and will make an accounting policy election after it completes its evaluation of the GILTI rules and the application of ASC 740.  
    
  As of   June 30, 2018  , the Company's foreign subsidiaries have accumulated undistributed earnings of approximately   $513.7 million   that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. No deferred tax liability has been recognized for the repatriation of these earnings. The Act eliminated any additional federal tax upon repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings; however, those earnings may still be subject to foreign withholding taxes if they are repatriated. At June 30, 2018 the unrecognized deferred tax liability on indefinitely reinvested earnings was   $25.5 million  , which is primarily foreign withholding tax. 
    
  Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: 

69 

    MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The valuation allowance as of   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017   primarily relates to certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and certain state tax credit carryforwards. The valuation allowance increased by   $17.7 million   in fiscal year   2018  .  
    
  As of   June 30, 2018  , the Company has   $18.7 million   of federal net operating loss carryforwards expiring at various dates between fiscal years 2021 and 2033,   $37.9 million   of state net operating loss carryforwards expiring at various dates through fiscal year 2033,   $133.9 million   of foreign net operating loss carryforwards with no expiration date,   $9.0 million   of state tax credit carryforwards expiring at various dates through fiscal year 2033, and   $106.1 million   of state tax credit carryforwards with no expiration date. 
    
  The Company classifies unrecognized tax benefits as (i) a current liability to the extent that payment is anticipated within one year; (ii) a non-current liability to the extent that payment is not anticipated within one year; or (iii) as a reduction to deferred tax assets to the extent that the unrecognized tax benefit relates to deferred tax assets such as operating loss or tax credit carryforwards or to the extent that operating loss or tax credit carryforwards would be able to offset the additional tax liability generated by unrecognized tax benefits. 
    
  A reconciliation of the change in gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties and the federal benefit for state unrecognized tax benefits, is as follows: 

70 

    MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of   June 30, 2018   that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is   $541.4 million  .   $50.1 million   of unrecognized tax benefits would be offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and thus would not affect the effective tax rate. 
    
  The Company reports interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The gross amount of interest and penalties recognized in income tax expense during the fiscal years ended   June 30, 2018  ,   June 24, 2017  , and   June 25, 2016   was   $27.8 million  ,   $22.4 million   and   $14.7 million  , respectively, and the total amount of interest and penalties accrued as of   June 30, 2018  ,   June 24, 2017  , and   June 25, 2016   was   $61.9 million  ,   $71.4 million  , and   $49.0 million  , respectively.  
    
  The Company engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits recognized by the Company, including accrued interest and penalties, could decrease by up to   $403.0 million   within the next twelve months due to the completion of federal tax audits, including any administrative appeals. The   $403.0 million   primarily relates to matters involving federal taxation of cross-border transactions.  
    
  The Company s federal corporate income tax returns are audited on a recurring basis by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ). The IRS concluded its field examination of the Company s federal corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and issued an IRS Revenue Agent's Report in July 2016 that included proposed adjustments for transfer pricing issues related to cost sharing and buy-in license payments for the use of intangible property by one of the Company s international subsidiaries. The Company disagreed with the proposed transfer pricing adjustments and related penalties, and in September 2016, the Company filed a protest to challenge the proposed adjustments and request a conference with the Appeals Office of the IRS. In May 2018, a preliminary understanding was reached with the IRS regarding the contested issues for the audit and post-audit years, which the Company expects may be finalized in fiscal year 2019 with the execution of a closing agreement. In June 2018 the Company made advance payments for audit and post-audit year tax of   $140.7 million   and interest of   $37.4 million  . These payments will reduce the accrual of interest on audit and post-audit year tax deficiencies that would be owed if the preliminary understanding is finalized. The Company s reserves for unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the audit and post-audit year tax deficiencies that would be owed as a result of the preliminary understanding. In fiscal year 2017, the IRS commenced an audit of the Company s federal corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2012 through 2014, which is ongoing. The Company expects that in fiscal year 2019 the IRS will commence an audit of the Company's federal corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. 
    
  A summary of the fiscal tax years that remain subject to examination, as of   June 30, 2018  , for the Company's major tax jurisdictions are as follows:

  Fiscal year 2016 
    
  San Jose Fab Shutdown 
    
  In October 2014, the Company initiated a plan to shut down its San Jose wafer fabrication facility. The Company reached the decision that it was not economically feasible to maintain this facility, which was used primarily for fab process development and low volume manufacturing, as the Company intended to utilize other resources to complete such activities in the future. This plan included cash charges related to employee severance and non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation. This plan has been completed, and the shutdown took place in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
    
  During the fiscal year ending   June 25, 2016  , the Company recorded accelerated depreciation charges of   $41.6 million   in  Cost of goods sold  and   $0.4 million   in  Severance and restructuring expenses  in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The sale of the San Jose wafer fabrication facility took place during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. The cumulative costs recorded in fiscal year 2015 and 2016 to complete this restructuring plan were   $100.3 million  . 
    
  Other Plans 
    
  During the fiscal year ending   June 25, 2016  , the Company recorded   $24.0 million   in  Severance and restructuring expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to various restructuring plans designed to reduce costs. These charges were associated with continued reorganization of certain business units and functions and the planned closure of the Dallas wafer level packaging ( WLP ) manufacturing facilities. Multiple job classifications and locations were impacted by these activities.  
    
  As part of the Dallas, Texas campus closure, including its WLP manufacturing facility in fiscal year 2017, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation charges of   $13.0 million   in  Cost of goods sold  in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the fiscal year ended   June 25, 2016  . 
    
  Future expected restructuring costs to be incurred with other plans was   $4.7 million   as of   June 25, 2016  .

Restructuring Accruals 
    
  The Company has accruals for severance and restructuring payments within Accrued salary and related expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table summarizes changes in the accruals associated with these restructuring activities during the fiscal years ended   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  : 

(1) Charges and changes in estimates are included in Severance and restructuring expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  Change in estimate: 
    
  Due to the above-mentioned restructuring activities, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation resulting from the change in estimated useful lives of certain long-lived assets included in restructuring plans. In all periods that accelerated depreciation expense was recorded, this resulted in additional expense and therefore impacted operating income (loss), net income (loss) and earnings per share as presented in the table below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
    
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. 
    
  Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders  equity and cash flows for the periods ended   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  , including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the  consolidated financial statements ).  We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of   June 30, 2018  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).   
    
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of years ended   June 30, 2018   and   June 24, 2017   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   June 30, 2018  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework     (2013)     issued by the COSO. 
    
  Basis for Opinions 
    
  The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.   
    
  Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
    
  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

78 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

These consolidated financial statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the results of the Company s operations and their cash flows for the year ended   June 25, 2016  , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule for the year ended June 25, 2016, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
