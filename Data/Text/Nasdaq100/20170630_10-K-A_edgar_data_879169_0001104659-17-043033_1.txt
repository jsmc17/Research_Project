  4.2                                   Gatekeeper . 
     
  (a)                                     Generally . Incyte shall promptly, but in no case later than [**] after the Effective Date, engage and retain an independent Third Party [**] and [**] (the   Gatekeeper  ) for the purpose of confirming whether a proposed Target Pair is Not Available and confirming whether a proposed [**] Target is an Incyte Specified Target, such engagement to include provisions relating to confidentiality substantially similar to those contained in this Agreement. Incyte will provide Merus a copy of the agreement for review reasonably prior to execution (which may be redacted to remove any sensitive financial or competitive information), and shall consider in good faith any Merus comments thereto. The cost of the Gatekeeper shall be borne by [**]. Until [**], the Gatekeeper will be responsible for maintaining the list of Incyte Specified Targets and an up-to-date list of Target Pairs that are Not Available (the   Not Available List  ). Upon notice from Incyte of engagement of the Gatekeeper, Merus shall provide the Gatekeeper (with a copy to Incyte) with the initial Not Available List (which shall include the reason for each Target Pair being Not Available). All communications regarding the availability of a Target Pair between the Parties shall be exchanged through the Gatekeeper. 
     
  (b)                                     Notice of Not Available . During the Research Term, Merus shall promptly, but in no case later than [**] after the occurrence of the events in the following subsections (i) or (ii), notify the Gatekeeper (i) if any Target Pair becomes Not Available and provide the reason for such Target Pair becoming Not Available and (ii) if any Target Pair ceases to be Not Available. Upon receipt of such notification, the Gatekeeper shall update the Not Available List accordingly. For clarity, Merus shall [**] at the time such [**]; provided that Merus shall be [**] to Incyte if Incyte seeks to designate a Target Pair for a Program in accordance with Section 4.4(c) or Section 4.5(b), as applicable. 
     
  4.3                                   Target Pairs; Program Caps . 
     
  (a)                                     Generally . The Parties agree that, as of the Effective Date, the Target Pairs under each of Program 1 and Program 2 have been designated, and that Program 1 and Program 2 are the only Programs for which a Target Pair has been designated. For each of the [**] Programs and Novel Programs, subject to Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5, Incyte has the sole right to designate a Target Pair as the subject of further research activities pursuant to a Research Plan. For clarity, except with respect to the rights granted to Incyte for Selected Monoclonal

Antibodies binding to individual Targets composing a particular Target Pair and the right of Incyte to  [**] for a [**] as a Licensed Antibody as described in Section 4.3(b), the designation by Incyte of a Target Pair for inclusion in a Program does not grant to Incyte any rights to Develop and Commercialize Antibodies binding to either (i) an [**] Target Pair, or (ii) any [**] in such Target Pair and [**] in any other Target Pair that has been [**] this Agreement, unless Incyte has elected or elects, subject to the Novel Program Cap or [**] Program Cap, as applicable, to include such [**] as the subject of a Novel Program under this Agreement. By way of example only, if Incyte designates each of (i) Target A x Target B and (ii) Target C x Target D as Target Pairs in two Programs under this Agreement, Incyte [**] this Agreement to Develop or Commercialize Antibodies [**] (unless Incyte had [**] Target), or to [**] Target Pair that is a [**] (e.g., [**])), unless Incyte has designated a Novel Program or [**] Program around such Target or Target Pair, subject to the Novel Program Cap or [**] Program Cap, as applicable. For clarity, nothing under this Section 4.3(a) shall prevent Incyte from Developing or Commercializing Antibodies directed at any single Target outside this Agreement, subject to Section 2.8(b)(i). 
     
  (b)                                     Program Caps . At any given time during the Research Term, there may be a maximum of eleven (11) Programs being actively pursued under this Agreement. More specifically, subject to the adjustments set forth below, in addition to Program 1 and Program 2, there may be an active maximum of (i) [**] Novel Programs (including any Novel Programs that have passed Program Selection, irrespective of whether such Programs have been terminated) (the   Novel Program Cap  ), and (ii) [**] Programs (including any [**] Programs that have passed Program Selection, irrespective of whether such Programs have been terminated) unless no [**] Target Pairs are designated by Incyte during the [**] Exclusivity Period, in which case the maximum shall be [**] Programs (the  [**]  Program Cap   provided that if the [**] Program Cap has been reached, any additional [**] Target Pair that Incyte wishes to designate may be included as a Novel Program Target Pair for a Novel Program if, at such time, the Novel Program Cap has not been reached. Furthermore, (A) if [**] becomes a Dropped Program, then the Novel Program Cap shall be [**], (B) if [**] becomes a Dropped Program, then the Novel Program Cap shall be [**], and (C) if (a) Incyte never designated any [**] Programs or (b) all [**] Programs included within the [**] Program Cap become Dropped Programs, then the Novel Program Cap shall be [**] such that, if all of the foregoing (A), (B), and (C) occur, the Novel Program Cap shall be [**]. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties may mutually agree at any time to increase the Novel Program Cap or the [**] Program Cap, either temporarily (e.g., to facilitate the conduct of research activities under particular Programs), or for the remainder of the Research Term. For clarity, if Incyte chooses to pursue a Selected Monoclonal Antibody as a Licensed Antibody and Licensed Product, Incyte would provide to Merus written notice thereof, and such Selected Monoclonal Antibody will be included as a Program within the Novel Program Cap or [**] Program Cap, as applicable, and subject to the terms of this Agreement.

4.4                                  [**]  Target Pairs . 
     
  (a)                                     Generally . Pursuant to the [**] Discovery Plan, the Parties will seek to identify one or more Target Pairs for nomination by Incyte as [**] Target Pairs. Potential [**] Target Pairs can arise de novo from the research or be defined by either of the Parties as set forth below. 
     
  (b)                                    [**]  Idea Sharing by Merus . During the Initial Research Term, Merus shall promptly propose to Incyte in writing all Target Pairs that Merus has identified for the potential creation of Bi-Specific Constructs, for which one of the Fab regions specifically binds to [**]. In each case where Merus proposes a [**] Target Pair to Incyte, Merus shall make available to Incyte, in a mutually-agreed upon format and without further financial consideration, and as applicable, the Merus Know-How related to such [**] Target Pairs and the proposed monoclonal Antibodies (and sequences therefor) and actual or proposed Bi-Specific Constructs specifically binding to such [**] Target Pairs, if any, which shall include a written report [**] the research and Development of Bi-Specific Constructs directed to such [**] Target Pair; provided that the absence or unavailability of any of such information shall not limit Merus s obligations to promptly propose Target Pair ideas to Incyte (but the [**] period set forth below shall not commence until such information is provided). Incyte may evaluate such [**] Target Pairs and the associated Bi-Specific Constructs and provide written notice to Merus not later than [**] after disclosure of such proposal and information thereof as to whether Incyte desires to designate such Target Pair as a [**] Target Pair under this Agreement. For clarity, a [**] Target Pair may include an IMOD Target. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.4(b), after the [**] Exclusivity Period, Merus is not required to disclose or offer to Incyte for inclusion under this Agreement any [**] Target Pairs that are [**] by [**] and [**] activities under this Agreement. 
     
  (c)                                     [**]  Idea Sharing by Incyte . Subject to the [**] Cap, at any time during the Research Term, Incyte may, in its sole discretion, provide written notice to Merus that Incyte wishes to propose a Target Pair for designation under a Program under this Agreement. Within [**] thereafter, Merus shall provide an updated Not Available List to the Gatekeeper (which shall include the reason for each Target Pair being Not Available); provided that such update shall be based on the status as of the date of Incyte s notice. Incyte may then, in its sole discretion, provide written notice to the Gatekeeper proposing one or more [**] Target Pairs for designation under a [**] Program, provided that [**], any such [**] Target Pair would only be able to be included within the collaboration [**]. Within [**] following the Gatekeeper s receipt of such notice, the Gatekeeper shall verify whether such [**] Target Pair requested by Incyte is on the Not Available List and notify Incyte in writing (the  [**]  Gatekeeper Notice  ) with respect thereto and, if it is Not Available, provide the reason given by Merus when placing such Target Pair on the Not Available List; provided that no [**] Target Pair proposed by Incyte shall be Not Available at any time during the [**] Exclusivity Period. If such proposed Target Pair requested by Incyte is on the Not Available List, then, at Incyte s request, Merus shall provide Incyte with written evidence [**] to Incyte that such Target Pair is Not Available. If such proposed [**] Target Pair requested by Incyte is not on the Not Available List, then the Gatekeeper shall also notify Merus of Incyte s proposed [**] Target Pair, and subject to the [**] Program Cap, such proposed [**] Target Pair shall be designated as a [**] Target Pair. For

clarity, if the [**] Cap has been reached and the Novel Program Cap has not yet been reached, Incyte may nominate [**] Target Pairs for inclusion as Novel Programs pursuant to Section 4.5. If the [**] Gatekeeper Notice indicates that the proposed [**] Target Pair is Not Available, then Incyte shall have the right to pursue such [**] Target Pair and Bi-Specific Constructs directed to such [**] Target Pair outside of this Agreement.  
     
  (d)                                     Ongoing  [**]  Target Pair Idea Sharing by Merus . Once the [**] Program Cap has been reached, Merus shall have no further obligation to offer potential [**] Target Pairs to Incyte pursuant to Section 4.4(b) (but shall remain required to disclose such Target Pairs pursuant to Section 4.5(a) if the Novel Program Target Cap has not been reached). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if during the Initial Research Term, a [**] Program [**], such that there are [**] Programs (that were not included under Novel Programs) at such time than the [**] Program Cap, [**] to Merus s [**] to Incyte for inclusion under a [**] Program under this Agreement (including with respect to any [**]). For clarity, (i) Section 4.4(b) shall not apply following [**] to any Target Pairs that are Not Available and (ii) Section 4.8 shall apply to any new Bi-Specific Constructs that [**] that [**] identifies after the applicable [**]. 
     
  4.5                                   Novel Program Target Pairs . 
     
  (a)                                     Target Pair Idea Sharing by Merus . During [**] until the Novel Program Cap is reached, Merus shall promptly propose to Incyte in writing [**] Bi-Specific Constructs (excluding any [**] Target Pair already disclosed to Incyte pursuant to Section 4.4 and, for clarity, including any Target Pair where one or both of the Targets is an IMOD Target), and shall make available to Incyte, in a mutually-agreed upon format and without further financial consideration, the Merus Know-How related to such Target Pairs and the proposed monoclonal Antibodies (and sequences therefor) and actual or proposed Bi-Specific Constructs specifically binding to such Target Pairs, if any, which shall include a written report [**] Bi-Specific Constructs directed to such Target Pair; provided that the absence or unavailability of any of such information shall not limit Merus s obligations to promptly propose Target Pair ideas to Incyte (but the [**] set forth below shall not commence until such information is provided). Incyte may evaluate such Target Pairs and the associated Bi-Specific Constructs for inclusion as Novel Program Target Pairs under this Agreement. For a period of [**] after Incyte s receipt of such proposal and information, such Target Pair may not be considered Not Available or added to the Not Available List and Incyte may designate such Target Pair as a Novel Program Target Pair hereunder, but may be added to the Not Available list at Merus s discretion following the expiration of such period, provided that Merus had satisfied the criteria for an Internal Merus Program at the time such Target Pair was offered to Incyte. At any time after such [**] period, Incyte may propose such Target Pair pursuant to Section 4.5(b). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.5(a), Merus is not required to disclose or offer to Incyte for inclusion under this Agreement any Targets or Target Pairs that are [**] by [**] and [**] activities under this Agreement. 
     
  (b)                                     Target Pair Idea Sharing by Incyte . Subject to the Novel Program Cap, at any time during the Research Term, Incyte may, in its sole discretion, provide written notice to Merus that Incyte wishes to propose a Target Pair for designation under a Program under this Agreement. Within [**] thereafter, Merus shall provide an updated Not Available List to the

Gatekeeper (which shall include the reason for each Target Pair being Not Available); provided that such update shall be based on the status as of the date of Incyte s notice. Incyte may then, in its sole discretion, provide written notice to the Gatekeeper proposing Target Pairs (other than and in addition to the Program 1 Target Pair, Program 2 Target Pair and any [**] Target Pairs included in the [**] Program Cap) for inclusion as a Novel Program Target Pair under this Agreement, provided that after the expiration of the Initial Research Term, any such Target Pair would only be able to be included within the collaboration as a replacement for a Dropped Target Pair. For clarity, Target Pairs proposed by Incyte under this Section 4.5(b) may (i) be [**] Target Pairs or (ii) include one or more IMOD Targets. Within [**] following the Gatekeeper s receipt of such notice, the Gatekeeper shall verify whether such Target Pair requested by Incyte is on the Not Available List and notify Incyte in writing (the   Novel Gatekeeper Notice  ) with respect thereto and, if it is Not Available, provide the reason given by Merus when placing such Target Pair on the Not Available List; provided that no Novel Program Target Pair containing [**] as a Target shall be Not Available at any time during the [**] Exclusivity Period, and no Reserved IMOD Target Pair may be Not Available during the IMOD Reserved Period. If such proposed Novel Program Target Pair requested by Incyte is on the Not Available List, then, at Incyte s request, Merus shall [**] such Novel Program Target Pair is Not Available. If such proposed Novel Program Target Pair requested by Incyte is not on the Not Available List, then the Gatekeeper shall also notify Merus of Incyte s proposed Target Pair and, subject to the Novel Program Cap, such proposed Novel Program Target Pair shall be a Novel Program Target Pair. If the Novel Gatekeeper Notice indicates that the proposed Novel Program Target Pair is Not Available, then Incyte shall have the right to pursue such Novel Program Target Pair and Bi-Specific Constructs directed to such Novel Program Target Pair outside of this Agreement.  
     
  (c)                                      Ongoing Novel Program Target Pair Idea Sharing by Merus . Once the Novel Program Cap has been reached, Merus shall have no further obligation to offer potential Targets and Target Pairs to Incyte for inclusion as Novel Program Target Pairs under this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.5(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if [**], a Novel Program [**], such that there are [**] applicable Novel Program Cap, [**] to Merus s [**] Targets and Target Pairs to Incyte for inclusion as Novel Program Target Pairs under this Agreement (including with respect to [**]). For clarity, (i) Section 4.5(a) shall not apply following a Drop Date to any Target Pairs that are Not Available and (ii) Section 4.8 shall apply to any new Bi-Specific Constructs that specifically bind to the Dropped Target Pair that Merus identifies after the applicable Drop Date. 
     
  4.6                                   Back-Up Bi-Specific Construct Substitution . At any time during the Term, Incyte may elect, at its discretion, to cease Development of one or more of the Bi-Specific Construct(s) for a Program (including both Novel Programs and [**] Programs). At any time during the Term, Incyte may elect, at its discretion, to advance one or more back-up Bi-Specific Constructs directed at the same Target Pair. If such election is made by Incyte [**] for the applicable Program, Incyte shall provide written notice to Merus and (a) the Parties shall [**] directed to such back-up Bi-Specific Constructs, and (b) the time period in which [**] shall be no less than [**] from the date of such notice. 
     
  4.7                                   Change in Status . If, at any time during the Research Term, any Target Pair that was identified as Not Available in a [**] Gatekeeper Notice or Novel Gatekeeper Notice is no

(d)                                     Ongoing Right to Drop and Replace . For clarity, Incyte s right to drop Programs and, at its discretion, elect to replace them pursuant to Sections 4.8(a), 4.8(b), and 4.8(c) applies also to Programs that replaced such Dropped Programs. For example, if Incyte drops Program 1 and replaces it with a Novel Program pursuant to Section 4.8(a), that Novel Program may subsequently be dropped and replaced with another Novel Program pursuant to Section 4.8(c) and so on until the earlier of either expiration of the Research Term or Program Selection for such Novel Program. 
     
  (e)                                      Release of Exclusivity . Upon any Target Pair becoming a Dropped Target Pair pursuant to Sections 4.8(a), 4.8(b) or 4.8(c) above then, subject to the applicable terms of this Agreement, Merus may thereafter Develop or Commercialize any Bi-Specific Construct that specifically binds to the applicable Dropped Target Pair. 
     
  (f)                                      [**]  New Bi-Specific Constructs on Dropped Target Pairs . During the Research Term, if Merus or an Affiliate commences internal research and Development activities with respect to any Bi-Specific Construct that specifically binds any Dropped Target Pair, and such Bi-Specific Construct [**], Merus [**] with respect to such [**] for consideration as a potential Novel Program Target Pair in accordance with Section 4.5(a), or a potential [**] Target Pair in accordance with Section 4.4(b), as applicable. Subject to the [**] Program Cap and the Novel Program Cap, as applicable (provided that Incyte may elect to drop a Target Pair pursuant to Section 4.8(a), 4.8(b), or 4.8(c) if such caps have been reached), Incyte shall have the right, exercisable within [**] following [**], to re-designate such Dropped Target Pair hereunder. If Incyte determines that it wishes to re-designate such Dropped Target Pair, Incyte shall reimburse Merus, within [**] following receipt of an invoice, for [**] of Merus s [**] incurred in [**] with respect to the [**] such Bi-Specific Construct and such Dropped Target Pair following the Drop Date. Upon Merus s receipt of such payment, such Dropped Target Pair will be reinstated under this Agreement and shall count towards the [**] Program Cap or the Novel Program Cap, as applicable. 
     
  (g)                                      License Grant . Promptly following Merus s request after a Program becoming a Dropped Program pursuant to this Section 4.8, Incyte for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, shall and hereby does     grant to Merus a non-exclusive (subject to Incyte s rights with respect to Selected Monoclonal Antibodies), worldwide, license (subject to the royalties set forth in Section 9.3(a)(ii)) in and to (i) any Incyte IP that is [**] or [**] Dropped Bi-Specific Products [**] for such Dropped Program for the Development, manufacture, or Commercialization of such Dropped Bi-Specific Products and (ii) all Arising Manufacturing Patents and Arising Product-Specific Patents, discovered, made or conceived under such Dropped Program for the Development, manufacture, or Commercialization of such Dropped Bi-Specific Products.

  (a)                                     Research Term Duration . Commencing on the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Parties shall collaborate to conduct discovery and research activities, including the activities set forth in this ARTICLE IV, until the earlier of (a) the date upon which a total of [**] Program Selections have occurred in relation to Bi-Specific Constructs arising from Programs conducted under this Agreement, and (b) the [**] of the Effective Date, (such period ending on the earlier of (a) or (b), including any extensions under the remainder of this Section 4.9, collectively, the   Research Term  ), provided that, following the expiration of the Initial Research Term, the total number of Programs being pursued under this Agreement may not be increased (e.g., if there are a total of seven (7) Programs ongoing at end of the Initial Research Term, no new Programs can be added but each of those seven (7) Programs may be dropped and a substitute selected one or more times pursuant to Section 4.8). Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the expiration of the Initial Research Term and during the remainder of the Research Term, Section 4.8 shall continue to apply, and Incyte may, [**], [**] for any [**]. If, as of the [**] of the Effective Date, fewer than [**] Program Selections have occurred (or such number of Program Selections corresponding to the total number of Programs that had either achieved Program Selection or were ongoing as of the expiration of the Initial Research Term, if less than [**]), Incyte shall have the right, at its discretion, to extend the Research Term for successive additional [**] periods (each, an   Extension Period  ), by providing written notice to Merus no later than [**] prior to the [**] (and each subsequent [**]) of the Effective Date, and paying an extension fee (the   Research Term Extension Fee  ) for each such [**] extension, of [**] within [**] following an invoice from Merus for such amount. Incyte s ability to extend the Research Term in accordance with the foregoing sentence shall apply until the achievement of [**] Program Selections (or such number of Program Selections corresponding to the total number of Programs that had either achieved Program Selection or were ongoing as of the expiration of the Initial Research Term, if less than [**]). 
     
  (b)                                     Expiration of the Research Term . If the Research Term expires at the end of an Extension Period because Incyte elects not to pay a Research Term Extension Fee under Section 4.9, and at such time [**] Program Selections have not been achieved, then if Merus is conducting activities under any Research Plan for a Program that has not yet achieved Program Selection, Merus shall, in accordance with the applicable Research Plan, (i) [**] all Programs that have not yet achieved Program Selection, and (ii) [**] for any Program for which a Target Pair has been designated pursuant to Sections 4.4 and/or 4.5 prior to the expiration of the Research Term but for which research activities have not yet commenced, in each case of (i) and (ii), until the earlier of (A) [**] under this Agreement, or (B) Incyte notifies Merus in writing that it [**]. Without limiting the foregoing, if at the expiration of the Research Term at the end of an Extension Period in accordance with this Section 4.9(b), regardless of whether [**] Program Selections have been achieved, Merus shall [**] with respect to any other active Programs, until [**].

  (a)                                     Discovery Activities . 
     
  (i)                                        [**]  Discovery Activities . Within [**] after the Effective Date, the JRC will prepare a plan and budget for review and approval by the JSC for the discovery of suitable [**] Target Pairs during the [**] Exclusivity Period ( [**]  Discovery Plan  ). The [**] Discovery Plan will assign responsibility for activities needed to identify Target Pairs for designation by Incyte as [**] Target Pairs. Merus shall use [**] to perform the obligations allocated to it under [**] Discovery Plan in accordance with the budget. Incyte may, in its sole discretion (A) perform activities set forth in the [**] Discovery Plan in parallel with Merus, (B) perform an activity in lieu of Merus, if Merus has not performed such activity pursuant to the timeline set forth in the [**] Discovery Plan, or (C) perform any other discovery activity. The duration of the [**] Discovery Plan shall be determined by the JRC. 
     
  (ii)                                      Novel Discovery Activities . Should the Parties mutually agree that discovery activities directed toward a potential Novel Program should be conducted under this Agreement, the JRC will prepare a plan and budget for review and approval by the JSC for the discovery of suitable Novel Program Target Pairs (  Novel Discovery Plan  ). The Novel Discovery Plan will assign responsibility for activities needed to identify Target Pairs for designation by Incyte as Novel Program Target Pairs. Merus shall use [**] to perform the obligations allocated to it under any Novel Discovery Plan in accordance with the budget. Incyte may, in its sole discretion (A) perform activities set forth in the Novel Discovery Plan in parallel with Merus, (B) perform an activity in lieu of Merus, if Merus has not performed such activity pursuant to the timeline set forth in the Novel Discovery Plan, or (C) perform any other discovery activity. The duration of each Novel Discovery Plan shall be determined by the JRC. 
     
  (b)                                     Research Plans . Within [**] after the Effective Date, the JRC shall prepare a research plan and budget for research activities for Program 1 and Program 2 (the   Initial Research Plans  ). The Initial Research Plans shall include the Selected Monoclonal Antibodies and General Monoclonal Antibodies for Program 1 and Program 2 previously generated by Merus. For a period of [**] after receipt of the Initial Research Plans, Incyte shall [**] such Selected Monoclonal Antibodies [**] and [**] Selected Monoclonal Antibodies which thereafter shall be the Selected Monoclonal Antibodies for Program 1 or Program 2, as applicable. Within [**] after designation of each Target Pair hereunder (other than the Program 1 Target Pair and Program 2 Target Pair), the JRC shall prepare a research plan and budget for research activities related to such Target Pair and the associated Bi-Specific Constructs through to Candidate Nomination (together with the Initial Research Plans, the   Research Plans  ) for review and approval by the JSC. For each such Program, Incyte shall have the right, in its discretion, to select the Selected Monoclonal Antibodies that will be used to generate the Target Pair Biclonics Matrix. The Research Plans shall (i) assign responsibilities to Merus including for generating Antibodies and Bi-Specific Constructs to be incorporated within each of the Licensed Products and conducting  in vitro  and  in vivo  pharmacology on such Bi-Specific Constructs and providing resulting materials and information to Incyte and (ii) include a budget, timeline, milestones and desired pre-clinical target characteristics for research and Development activities through to Candidate Nomination. The intent of each Research Plan is to set forth the activities necessary to achieve Candidate Nomination with respect to a given Program. The duration of each Research Plan shall be less than or equal to [**] unless otherwise determined by the JRC; provided that Merus shall not be obligated to create a Target Pair Biclonics Matrix for more than (A) [**] Target Pairs per year during Calendar Years [**] or (B) [**] Target Pairs per Calendar Year

thereafter. Merus shall use [**] to perform the obligations allocated to it under each Research Plan in accordance with the budget and shall ensure that any obligations Merus has to Third Parties do not cause Merus to have insufficient capacity to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Incyte may, in its sole discretion, (x) perform Research activities set forth in the Research Plans in parallel with Merus, (y) perform a research activity in lieu of Merus, if Merus has not performed such activity pursuant to the timeline set forth in a Research Plan, or (z) perform any other research activity related to such Program.  
     
  (c)                                      Discovery and Research Activity Costs . All Research Costs for Program 1 are Development Costs and shared equally by the Parties pursuant to Section 5.3(b)(iii). All Research Costs for Program 2, and each Novel Program, and for the [**] Discovery Plan, any Novel Discovery Plan and each [**] Program, up to [**] of the amount budgeted in the [**] Discovery Plan, any Novel Discovery Plan and applicable Research Plan (the   Reimbursable Research Costs  ) shall be borne by Incyte. If Merus in good faith believes it will be necessary to incur costs in excess of the Reimbursable Research Costs in carrying out activities that are necessary in order to fulfil the requirements of the [**] Discovery Plan, any Novel Discovery Plan or a Research Plan, it shall secure Incyte s prior written consent before conducting such activities. Provided such prior written consent has been secured, such costs will also be reimbursed by Incyte. Merus shall have no obligation to carry out any research activities that will incur Research Costs that exceed the Reimbursable Research Costs unless Incyte has provided its consent to reimburse such excess Research Costs or unless it is necessary for Merus to re-perform research activities that were improperly performed under a Research Plan and are necessary for Merus to provide a complete and accurate Data Package. At the time the [**] Discovery Plan, any Novel Discovery Plan or any Research Plan for which there are Reimbursable Research Costs is created by the JRC and approved by the JSC, the Parties shall agree on a [**] reporting and payment structure to implement the cost sharing set forth in this Section 4.10(c). If Incyte performs an activity in lieu of Merus pursuant to Section 4.10(a), the cost of performing such activity shall be removed from the budget allocated to Merus for such activity and Incyte shall not be required to reimburse Merus for such costs, provided it so notified Merus in advance that it was performing itself such activity. 
     
  (d)                                     Reporting . Merus shall provide the JRC with a written report at least [**] summarizing in reasonable detail Merus s and its Affiliates  activities, progress and expenditures compared to allocated budget under the [**] Discovery Plan, any Novel Discovery Plans and Research Plans. Incyte shall provide the JRC with a written report at least [**] summarizing in reasonable detail Incyte s and its Affiliates  activities, if any, under the [**] Discovery Plan, any Novel Discovery Plans and Research Plans, or any other activities it elected to undertake, as contemplated under Section 4.10(a). 
     
  4.11                            Additional Research Activities . The JRC may require that certain activities under the Research Plans be repeated, new research be conducted, that Bi-Specific Constructs be created, modified or re-engineered or other research-related activities related to the Licensed Antibodies be performed and the JRC will adjust the applicable Research Plan and the associated budget accordingly. In each case, [**] shall be responsible for all Research Costs incurred under any such amended Research Plan budget that is approved by the JSC. During the Term, in connection with Development activities under any Program, Incyte may, in its discretion, select

by written notice to Merus, one or more General Monoclonal Antibodies for potential use in the generation of a Bi-Specific Construct under such Program.  Promptly after such notice, Merus will notify Incyte whether Merus has granted rights to such General Monoclonal Antibody to any Third Party. If Merus has granted rights to such General Monoclonal Antibody to a Third Party, Incyte may (but shall not be required to) request that Merus create a monoclonal Antibody that is less than [**] homologous in HCDR3 to such General Monoclonal Antibody and subsequently deem such modified General Monoclonal Antibody a Selected Monoclonal Antibody under such Program. Incyte may request that Merus generate Bi-Specific Constructs using such modified General Monoclonal Antibody (in which case, the provisions of Section 2.8(b) shall not be applicable to such modified General Monoclonal Antibody). If Merus has not granted rights to the General Monoclonal Antibody to any Third Party, Incyte may deem such General Monoclonal Antibody as a Selected Monoclonal Antibody under such Program. If Incyte wishes to designate one or more General Monoclonal Antibodies as Selected Monoclonal Antibodies under this Section 4.11, and the total number of Selected Monoclonal Antibodies would subsequently exceed the applicable number authorized by Section 1.127, Incyte shall contemporaneously designate an equal number of Selected Monoclonal Antibodies of its choice to become General Monoclonal Antibodies such that there will thereafter be only the number of Selected Monoclonal Antibodies authorized by Section 1.127 for such Program. If Incyte deems one or more General Monoclonal Antibodies as Selected Monoclonal Antibodies under this Section 4.11, and the total number of Selected Monoclonal Antibodies on either individual arm of a Target Pair would subsequently exceed [**], Incyte shall contemporaneously designate an equal number of Selected Monoclonal Antibody of its choice to become a General Monoclonal Antibody such that there will thereafter be no more than [**] Selected Monoclonal Antibodies on either individual arm of such Target Pair in accordance with Section 1.127. Once such Selected Monoclonal Antibodies becomes a General Monoclonal Antibodies, all licenses granted to Incyte under such Antibody as a Selected Monoclonal Antibody shall terminate.

(iii)                                  In the event (A) the Program 1 JDC determines that such Clinical Trial or Development activity may support the worldwide Development of Program 1 Products (a   Global Study   (B) the Program 1 JDC approves such proposal, with the consent of both Parties, or, if the JDC does not approve such proposal and the matter is escalated to the JSC, the JSC approves such proposal, with the consent of both Parties and with neither Party having final say; and (C) the Parties agree to collaborate to conduct such Clinical Trial or other Development activity with respect to the Program 1 Product (any of the items in (A) through (C), a   Program 1 Joint Development Activity  ), then the Parties shall, through the Program 1 JDC, create a development plan (the   Program 1 Joint Development Plan  ) that includes a detailed description of the Program 1 Joint Development Activity to be undertaken by the Parties (or if a Program 1 Joint Development Plan already exists, amend such plan to include the new Program 1 Joint Development Activity) and develop a detailed annual budget for all Development Costs for such Joint Development Activity to be included in the Program 1 Joint Development Plan (the   Program 1 Joint Development Budget  ). Each Party shall use [**] to perform the obligations allocated to such Party under the Program 1 Joint Development Plan. All Development Costs set forth in the Program 1 Joint Development Budget shall be shared equally by the Parties whether incurred by Merus or Incyte or their respective Affiliates (i.e., each Party shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the Development Costs set forth in the Program 1 Joint Development Budget). At the time Program 1 Joint Development Plan and associated Program 1 Joint Development Budget (or any amendments thereto) is established by the Program 1 JDC and approved by the JSC, the Parties shall agree on a [**] reporting and payment structure to implement the cost sharing set forth in the preceding sentence. In the event either Party fails to timely make an undisputed payment under such agreed on payment structure, the payment amount shall be reflected as a credit against the monies due by the other Party under ARTICLE IX, or, if no such credit is available as no such monies are due by the other Party, shall be paid by such Party within [**] after invoice, and the terms of subsection (iv) below shall apply. 
     
  (iv)                                 Should either Party (A) fail to timely pay any such invoice for Development Costs for activities set forth and in accordance with the Program 1 Joint Development Budget within [**] following written notice from the other Party, or (B) elect, by [**] advance written notice to the other Party, to cease funding Program 1 Development Costs under the Program 1 Joint Development Budget (such action, a   Program 1 Opt-Out  ), then such Party shall continue to have the right to Develop and Commercialize the Program 1 Product in the United States (in the case of Merus) or the Incyte Territory (in the case of Incyte) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, but shall thereafter have no right to access or use any clinical and non-clinical data generated as a result of any Joint Development Activity occurring under the Program 1 Joint Development Plan, or any activities conducted by Incyte in relation to the Development and Commercialization of the Program 1 Product, in each case after the date of the occurrence of either of the events in (A) or (B) (such date, the   Program 1 Opt-Out Date  ). If such Party subsequently desires to obtain access to any such data generated after the Program 1 Opt-Out Date, the terms of Section 5.3(d) shall apply. 
     
  (c)                                      Right to Proceed with Development Activity . If the other Party declines or does not elect to participate in a proposed Program 1 Joint Development Activity at least [**] prior to (i) in the case of Clinical Trials, the estimated FPFV date (as notified by the submitting Party in its proposal for such Program 1 Joint Development Activity) or (ii) planned date of

commencement of such other Program 1 Joint Development Activities, the submitting Party may proceed with such Clinical Trial or Development activity for its territory and would be solely responsible for the conduct and costs of such Clinical Trial or Development activity; provided that neither Party may proceed with such Clinical Trial or Development activity if a Party reasonably determines that the activity is reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the Development and/or Commercialization of the Program 1 Products in its territory. Any dispute regarding whether an activity is reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the Development and/or Commercialization of the Program 1 Product in a Party s territory shall be resolved in accordance with Section 3.5(b).  
     
  (d)                                     Program 1 Buy-In Right . 
     
  (i)                                        If (A) a Party fails to elect to participate in a Clinical Trial or Development activity pursued by the other Party pursuant to Section 5.3(b), (B) either Party exercises a Program 1 Opt Out with respect to any Program 1 Joint Development Activity or (C) a Party desires to access data generated by a Clinical Trial or Development activity performed independently by the other Party, such Party (the   Buy-In Party  ) may obtain access to and use of all clinical and non-clinical data generated pursuant to the relevant Clinical Trial or Development activity (the   Buy-In Data  ), as if such Party had co-funded such Clinical Trial or Development activity from the outset, in accordance with the following procedure: At least on a semi-annual basis, the Party participating in a Clinical Trial or Development activity pursuant to Section 5.3(a) shall update the Buy-In Party on the status of such Clinical Trial or Development activity, including a summary of relevant Buy-In Data. At any time, the Buy-In Party may provide the other Party with notice of its election to participate in such Clinical Trial or Development activity, and promptly thereafter the other Party shall provide the Buy-In Party with an invoice for [**] of the Development Costs incurred by the other Party in the generation of such clinical data as of the date of the Buy-In Party s written request, which invoice the Buy-In Party shall pay within [**] after receipt. Thereafter, to the extent the Development activity has not been completed, the Buy-In Party shall be responsible for [**] of the Development Costs incurred by the other Party through to completion of such Development activity. Such payment shall entitle the Buy-In Party to (1) use the Buy-In Data to the same extent as such Party would have been permitted to use such Buy-In Data if it had co-funded such Clinical Trial or Development activity as a Program 1 Joint Development Activity from the outset under Section 5.3(b), and (2) the rights set forth in Section 5.3(e). The other Party shall, as applicable, provide copies of, and/or a Right of Reference or Use of, the requested Buy-In Data to the Buy-In Party promptly after receipt of the invoiced amount. 
     
  (ii)                                     For the avoidance of doubt, the buy-in right pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) does not include the right to operational participation in the conduct of the Clinical Trial or Development activity unless, at the sole discretion of the Party that initiated the Clinical Trial or Development activity, such Party grants operational participation to the Buy-In Party. 
     
  (iii)                                  In the event the Buy-In Party fails to meet any payment obligation pursuant to this Section 5.3(d), and such failure continues for [**] after the original due date of the payment, until such delinquency is cured, the Buy-In Data with respect to such exercise of

the buy-in right shall not be shared with the Buy-In Party. In the event such delinquency is not cured within such [**] period, the Buy-In Party s notice of election to participate shall be considered void.  
     
  (iv)                                 With respect to Buy-In Data falling within Section 5.3(d)(i)(C), such Buy-In Data will not be included, with respect to Program 1, within (A) the Merus Know-How for purposes of Section 2.3 (where Incyte is the Buy-In Party) or (B) the Incyte Know-How for purposes of Section 2.4 (where Merus is the Buy-In Party), until the Buy-In Party has fully satisfied its payment obligations with respect to such Buy-In Data under this Section 5.3(d). Following payment, such Buy-In Data will be included for Program 1 within the Merus Know-How, or the Incyte Know-How, as applicable, that is licensed to the other Party under this Agreement. 
     
  (v)                                    If a Party does not buy in pursuant to this Section 5.3(d), then such Party shall have no right to obtain access to or to use the Buy-In Data in accordance with Section 5.3(e) below, except to the extent such Buy-In Data is relevant to or necessary to address issues relating to the safety of the Program 1 Product, including data relating to adverse effects associated with the Program 1 Product and safety related clinical, manufacturing and controls activities relating to the Program 1 Product, in each case solely (A) to the extent required to be reported to or made available to Regulatory Authorities in such Party s Territory, and (B) solely in such countries where such Party has the right to Develop and Commercialize the Program 1 Product. 
     
  (e)                                      Rights to Data and Documentation . With respect to any Program 1 Joint Development Activities or where the Buy-In Party buys in:

  (d)                                     Payment; Reporting . Within [**] following the end of each Calendar Quarter after Merus has exercised the [**] Co-Development Option, Incyte shall prepare and deliver to Merus a [**] report detailing its Development Costs incurred during such period with respect to the [**] Co-Development Program together with an invoice for thirty-five percent (35%) of such Development Costs identified. Merus shall pay all undisputed amounts payable under any such invoice within [**] after its receipt of such invoice, provided that, with respect to any Development Costs incurred by Incyte in relation to the [**] Co-Development Product in excess of [**] of the then-approved [**] Co-Development Budget without prior notification to Merus and the approval of the [**] JDC (and if not approved by the [**] JDC, the JSC), Merus shall be required to pay any undisputed excess amounts within [**] after its receipt of the invoice including such excess costs. Merus shall have the right to audit the records of Incyte with respect to any purported Development Costs included in such reports, in accordance with Section 9.8. 
     
  (e)                                     [**]  Co-Development Product Substitution . If Incyte terminates this Agreement with respect to a [**] Co-Development Program and advances an alternative [**] Program pursuant to Section 4.8(b), then Merus shall have the right to exercise the [**] Co-Development Option with respect to such alternative [**] Program; provided that, to exercise the [**] Co-Development Option on such alternative [**] Program, Merus must (i) be current on reimbursement of its share of Development Costs for the [**] Co-Development Program, (ii) provide written notice of such exercise to Incyte any time after Program Selection for such alternative [**] Program, but no later than [**] prior to the anticipated date of the FPFV for the first Clinical Trial for the first [**] Antibody arising from such alternative [**] Program, of which Incyte shall inform Merus in writing, and (iii) reimburse Incyte for [**] of all Research Costs and Development Costs then-incurred by Incyte.

The Initial Enforcing Party will have the right to provide input regarding the Third Party Infringement, and the Second Enforcing Party will consider all such input in good faith. At the request and expense of the Second Enforcing Party, the Initial Enforcing Party shall provide reasonable assistance to the Second Enforcing Party in connection therewith, including by executing reasonably appropriate documents, and cooperating in discovery; provided that nothing herein shall require the Initial Enforcing Party to join as a party or otherwise participate in such legal action, if in the Initial Enforcing Party s reasonable opinion such participation will damage any of the Initial Enforcing Party s commercial relationships. The Initial Enforcing Party may choose, at its own expense, to be represented in any such action by counsel of its own choice; provided that if the Initial Enforcing Party is required as a necessary party to such action other than as a joint owner, the Second Enforcing Party shall pay the Initial Enforcing Party s reasonable expenses associated therewith. In connection with any such proceeding, the Second Enforcing Party shall not enter into any settlement admitting the invalidity of or otherwise impairing the Initial Enforcing Party s rights under the Initial Enforcing Party s Intellectual Property without the prior written consent of the Initial Enforcing Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

  C.                                       No separate payment shall be made for the last Calendar Quarter in any Calendar Year. Instead, at the end of each such Calendar Year, a final reconciliation shall be conducted by comparing the share of Net Profit or Net Loss to which a Party is otherwise entitled for such Calendar Year pursuant to this Section 9.6 against the sum of all amounts (if any) previously paid or retained by such Party for prior Calendar Quarters during such Calendar Year, and the Parties shall make reconciling payments to one another no later than

  9.7                                   Financial Records . The Parties shall keep complete and accurate books and records in accordance with the defined Accounting Standards.

Prior to commencing its work pursuant to this agreement, the Audit Team shall enter into an appropriate confidentiality agreement with the Auditee. 
     
  (b)                                    In respect of each audit of the Auditee s books and records: (i) the Auditee may be audited only once per year, (ii) no records for any given year for an Auditee may be audited more than once; provided that the Auditee s records shall still be made available if such records impact another financial year which is being audited, (iii) the Audit Rights Holder shall only be entitled to audit books and records of an Auditee from the [**] Calendar Years prior to the Calendar Year in which the audit request is made.

  (d)                                    The audit report and basis for any determination by an Audit Team shall be made available first for review and comment by the Auditee, and the Auditee shall have the right, at its expense, to request a further determination by such Audit Team as to matters which the Auditee disputes (to be completed no more than [**] after the first determination is provided to such Auditee and to be limited to the disputed matters). If the Parties disagree as to such further determination, the Audit Right Holder and the Auditee shall mutually select one of the  Big Four  accounting firms (Deloitte, Ernst   Young, KPMG or PricewaterhouseCoopers) that shall make a final determination as to the remaining matters in dispute that shall be binding upon the Parties. Such accountants shall not disclose to the Audit Rights Holder any information relating to the business of the Auditee except that which should properly have been contained in any report required hereunder or otherwise required to be disclosed to such Party to the extent necessary to verify the payments required to be made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 
     
  (e)                                     If the audit shows any under-reporting or underpayment, or overcharging by any Party, that under-reporting, underpayment or overcharging shall be reported to the Audit Rights Holder and the underpaying or overcharging Party shall remit such underpayment or reimburse such overcompensation to the underpaid or overcharged Party within [**] after receiving the audit report. Further, if the audit for an annual period shows an under-reporting or underpayment or an overcharge by any Party for that period in excess of [**] of the amounts properly determined, the underpaying or overcharging Party, as the case may be, shall reimburse the applicable underpaid or overcharged Audit Rights Holder conducting the audit, for its respective audit fees and reasonable Out-of-Pocket Costs in connection with said audit, which reimbursement shall be made within [**] after receiving appropriate invoices and other support for such audit-related costs. 
     
  (f)                                      For the purposes of the audit rights described herein, an individual Party subject to an audit in any given year will be referred to as the   Auditee   and the other Party who has certain and respective rights to audit the books and records of the Auditee will be referred to as the   Audit Rights Holder  .

The royalties, milestones and other amounts payable by pursuant to this Agreement (  Payments  ) shall not be reduced on account of any taxes unless required by Law. Each Party alone shall be responsible for paying any and all taxes (other than withholding taxes required by Law to be deducted and paid on by the other Party on such Party s behalf) levied on account of, or measured in whole or in part by reference to, any Payments it receives. The Parties will cooperate in good faith to obtain the benefit of any relevant tax treaties to minimize as far as reasonably possible any taxes which may be levied on any Payments. Each Party shall deduct or withhold from the Payments any taxes that it is required by Law to deduct or withhold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either Party is entitled under any applicable tax treaty to a reduction of the rate of, or the elimination of, applicable withholding tax, it may deliver to the other Party or the appropriate governmental authority (with the assistance of the other Party to the extent that this is reasonably required and is expressly requested in writing) the prescribed forms necessary to reduce the applicable rate of withholding or to relieve the other

Party of its obligation to withhold tax, and the other Party shall apply the reduced rate of withholding tax, or dispense with withholding tax, as the case may be, provided that the other Party has received evidence of such delivery of all applicable forms (and, if necessary, its receipt of appropriate governmental authorization) at least  [**]  prior to the time that the Payment is due. If, in accordance with the foregoing, a Party withholds any amount, it shall make timely payment to the proper taxing authority of the withheld amount, and send to the other Party proof of such payment within [**] following that latter payment. 
     
  9.10                            Currency Exchange . The currency exchange method set out in this Section 9.10 shall be applied for calculations of amounts for (a) Net Sales and royalties, and (b) Development Costs and Allowable Expenses. With respect to amounts invoiced in United States Dollars, all such amounts shall be expressed in United States Dollars. With respect to amounts invoiced in a currency other than United States Dollars, all such amounts shall be expressed both in the currency in which the amount was invoiced and in the United States Dollar equivalent. The United States Dollar equivalent shall be calculated using the average of the last (bid) United States dollar/foreign currency rates for the last Business Day of each month in the Calendar Quarter for which Net Sales, royalties, Development Costs and Allowable Expenses, each as applicable, are being reported, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, for the conversion of foreign currency sales into United States Dollars. 
     
  9.11                            Invoices . Where any payment due under this Agreement requires a Party to invoice the other Party following notification of an event triggering such payment from the paying Party, including with respect to any milestone payments payable under this ARTICLE IX, the non-paying Party may invoice the paying Party for such payment prior to receiving such notification, if the non-paying Party becomes aware of the occurrence of the event triggering such payment obligation by means other than such notification, including by press release or other public disclosure of such event issued by the paying Party. 
     
  9.12                            Late Payments . The paying Party shall pay interest to the receiving Party on the aggregate amount of any payments that are not paid on or before the date such payments are due under this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of the [**] LIBOR rate for United States dollars, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, plus [**] or the highest rate permitted by applicable Law, calculated on the number of days such payments are paid after the date such payments are due; provided, that with respect to any disputed payments, no interest payment shall be due until such dispute is resolved and the interest which shall be payable thereon shall be based on the finally-resolved amount of such payment, calculated from the original date on which the disputed payment was due through the date on which payment is actually made. 
     
   ARTICLE X  TERM AND TERMINATION   
     
  10.1                            Agreement Term . The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue on a Program-by-Program basis unless earlier dropped pursuant to Section 4.8 or terminated pursuant to Section 10.2, until (a) with respect to Program 1, Program 2, [**] Non-Co Programs, and Novel Programs (other than any Additional Co-Development Programs), following the First Commercial Sale of any such Licensed Product, the expiration of 
     
   [**] = Portions of this exhibit have been omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request.  An unredacted version of this exhibit has been filed separately with the Commission.

the last-to-expire of all Royalty Terms with respect to all Licensed Products within such Program, and (b) with respect to the  [**]  Co-Development Program and Additional Co-Development Program, following the First Commercial Sale of any such [**] Co-Development Product or Additional Co-Development Product, as applicable, the later of (i) expiration of the last-to-expire of all Royalty Terms outside the United States for such [**] Co-Development Product or Additional Co-Development Product, as applicable, and (ii) the cessation of Commercialization of such [**] Co-Development Product or Additional Co-Development Product, as applicable, in the United States (the   Term  ). 
     
  10.2                            Termination . 
     
  (a)                                     Termination by Incyte for Convenience . Incyte shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for convenience (i) in its entirety upon [**] prior written notice to Merus, or (ii) on a Program-by-Program basis, at any time following Program Selection for the applicable Program (A) with respect to Program 1 or any [**] Co-Development Program upon [**] prior written notice to Merus, and (B) with respect to Program 2, any [**] Non-Co Program, or any Novel Program, upon [**] prior written notice to Merus. For clarity, an election by Incyte to cease activities under a given Program prior to Program Selection makes such Program a Dropped Program pursuant to Section 4.8 and such Program is not subject to this Section 10.2(a). 
     
  (b)                                     Termination for Material Breach . If either Party (the   Non-Breaching Party  ) believes that the other Party (the   Breaching Party  ) is in material breach of this Agreement, then the Non-Breaching Party may deliver notice of such breach to the Breaching Party, which such notice shall describe such breach in sufficient detail to allow the Breaching Party to cure such breach. If the Breaching Party fails to cure such breach, or take such steps that would be considered reasonable to effectively cure such breach within the [**] period ([**] period for non-payment) after delivery of such notice, the Non-Breaching Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Breaching Party, which termination shall apply (i) solely with respect to a particular Program (and all Licensed Products for such Program) if the harm from such breach is related solely to such Program, or (ii) at the discretion of the Non-Breaching Party if such breach is not related solely to a single Program, either (A) with respect to the Programs that are the subject of such breach or (B) with respect to all [**] Programs if the breach is related to multiple [**] Programs or with respect to all Novel Programs if the breach is related to multiple Novel Programs. Except with respect to non-payment, if during such [**] period the Breaching Party is undertaking steps that would be considered reasonable to effectively cure such breach, the cure period shall be extended by an additional [**]. 
     
  (c)                                      Termination for Patent Challenge . Except to the extent the following is unenforceable under the laws of a particular jurisdiction, if a Party or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, (i) initiates or requests an interference or opposition proceeding with respect to any Merus Patent Rights (if such Party is Incyte) or Incyte Patent Rights (if such Party is Merus), (ii) makes, files, or maintains any claim, demand, lawsuit, or cause of action to challenge the validity or enforceability of any Merus Patent Right (if such Party is Incyte) or Incyte Patent Rights (if such Party is Merus) in a tribunal or forum, or (iii) opposes any extension of, or the grant of a supplementary protection certificate with respect to, any Merus Patent Right (if such Party is Incyte) or Incyte Patent Rights (if such Party is Merus), then the other Party may 
       
   [**] = Portions of this exhibit have been omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request.  An unredacted version of this exhibit has been filed separately with the Commission.   
     
 94   

terminate this Agreement solely with respect to any Programs to which such patent challenge relates upon [**] prior written notice to such Party. Any such termination will only become effective such Party or its Affiliate, as applicable, has not withdrawn such action before the end of the above notice period.  
     
  (d)                                     Termination Disputes . If the Breaching Party disputes in good faith the existence or materiality of a breach specified in a notice provided by the other Party under Section 10.2(b), or if a Non-Breaching Party gives notice of termination under Section 10.2(b) and the Breaching Party disputes whether such notice was proper, then the issue of whether such breach has occurred and/or whether this Agreement was properly terminated shall be resolved in accordance with ARTICLE XIV, and the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until such dispute is resolved. If as a result of such dispute resolution process it is determined that (i) the Breaching Party has in fact materially breached the Agreement, then such Party must cure such breach within [**] following such determination; or (ii) the notice of termination was proper, then such termination shall be effective on the date on which such dispute is resolved. If as a result of the dispute resolution process it is determined that the Breaching Party has not materially breached the Agreement, or the notice of termination for uncured material breach was improper, then no termination shall have occurred and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 
     
  10.3                            Effects of Termination . Upon any termination of this Agreement, the following will apply: 
     
  (a)                                    All rights and licenses granted by either Party hereunder shall immediately terminate with respect to the Terminated Programs; 
     
  (b)                                    Incyte shall Transition the Terminated Programs to Merus pursuant to Section 10.5; 
     
  (c)                                     Merus shall pay Incyte a grantback royalty pursuant to Section 10.6 with respect to any future Net Sales of Terminated Products; 
     
  (d)                                    The provisions of Section 2.8 will cease to apply with respect to Terminated Programs; 
     
  (e)                                     The provisions of ARTICLE VIII (other than Sections 8.1) will cease to apply to Terminated Programs; and 
     
  (f)                                      Following any termination of a Program occurring prior to Program Selection for such Program, Section 4.8 shall apply. 
     
  10.4                            Alternative to Termination by Incyte . If Incyte has a right to terminate this Agreement for Merus s uncured material breach pursuant to Section 10.2(b), subject to Section 10.2(d), Incyte may elect in its notice of termination to, in lieu of terminating this Agreement with respect to the affected Programs and [**], have all rights and licenses granted hereunder with respect to such Programs continue and receive [**] or as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing in their sole discretion. The payment of amounts under this Section 10.4 shall

  10.5                            Transition . In the event of termination of this Agreement, whether in its entirety or with respect to a Terminated Program, at Merus s request, Incyte shall transition to Merus Incyte s relevant rights and obligations with respect to the Terminated Program as reasonably necessary for Merus to Develop and Commercialize the Terminated Programs after termination as set forth in this Section 10.5(a) through 10.5(j) (the   Transition  ). 
     
  (a)                                    Incyte shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, transfer and assign to Merus all of its right, title, and interest in all Regulatory Documentation then Controlled by Incyte and held in its name applicable to the Terminated Programs, the data comprising the Global Safety Database, and other documented technical information, Know-How, and materials Controlled by Incyte that were generated under this Agreement by Incyte with respect to the Terminated Program and are necessary for the Development, manufacture, and Commercialization of the Terminated Products (as they exist as of the effective date of termination) worldwide or, if the Terminated Product is a Program 1 Product, in the Incyte Territory, and Merus shall provide Incyte with access to and a right of reference to all of the foregoing for all uses in relation to Programs or activities under this Agreement; 
     
  (b)                                    Incyte shall notify the applicable Regulatory Authorities and take any other action reasonably necessary to effect the transfer set forth in subsection (a) above;

In addition, with respect to each Clinical Trial for which such transfer is expressly prohibited by the applicable Regulatory Authority or for which Merus does not wish to continue, if any, Incyte shall in its discretion either (i) wind down such Clinical Trial if permitted by the applicable Regulatory Authorities and Law or (ii) continue to conduct such Clinical Trial to the point at which it may be so transferred, wound down, or to completion, in each case at Merus s cost; 
     
  (d)                                    Incyte shall provide to Merus a summary report of the status of the Development and Commercialization of the Terminated Products in each country (i) worldwide with respect to Program 2, any [**] Program, and any Novel Program, and (ii) in the Incyte Territory with respect to Program 1 through the effective date of such termination;

 96   

with respect to Program 1; provided that such trademarks were used in connection with the Commercialization of Terminated Products as of or prior to the effective date of termination.  
     
  (f)                                      Merus may, within [**] following the effective date of such termination, elect to obtain Incyte s inventory of Terminated Product manufactured by a Third Party; provided that if Merus elects to obtain Incyte s inventory of Terminated Product, Merus may not use any trademarks, names, and logos of Incyte contained therein (except to the extent transferred pursuant to Section 10.5(e)) in connection with the sale of such inventory.

  (i)                                        either (A) assign to Merus Incyte s right, title, and interest in and to any agreements with Third Parties for the manufacture of Terminated Product if such agreements are [**] transferable [**] to Incyte or (B) if such agreements are [**] or transferable [**] to Incyte, in exchange for a payment equal to [**] (or [**] if termination is due to Merus s breach) of Incyte s Manufacturing Cost, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to supply Merus s and its Affiliates  requirements of Terminated Product in the dosage strength, formulation and presentation as were being Developed or Commercialized as of the effective date of termination until the earlier of [**] after the effective date of the termination and establishment by Merus of an alternative supply for such Terminated Product; provided that Merus shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to establish an alternative supply as promptly as reasonably practicable.

Accordingly, during the Term applicable to a Program and except with respect to Program 1, Merus shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents to, keep completely confidential, and not publish or otherwise disclose, and not use directly or indirectly for any purpose other than to fulfill Merus s obligations, or exercise Merus s rights, hereunder Confidential Information Controlled by Merus or any of its Affiliates specifically relating to any Licensed Antibody or Licensed Product (the   Product Information   except to the extent (a) the Product Information is in the public domain through no fault of Merus, its Affiliates or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents; (b) such disclosure or use is expressly permitted under Section 13.3 or (c) such disclosure or use is otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of Section 13.2 Incyte shall be deemed to be the disclosing Party with respect to Product Information under Section 13.2 and Merus shall be deemed to be the receiving Party with respect thereto. For further clarification, (i) without limiting this Section 13.1, to the extent Product Information is disclosed by Merus to Incyte pursuant to this Agreement, such information shall, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Article XIII, also constitute Confidential Information of Merus with respect to the use and disclosure of such Information by Merus, but (ii) the disclosure by Merus to Incyte of Product Information shall not cause such information to cease to be subject to the provisions of this Section 13.1 with respect to the use and disclosure of such Confidential Information by Merus.

Each Receiving Party shall maintain in confidence the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and shall not otherwise disclose such Confidential Information to any Third Party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.

Each Party will promptly notify the other upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information of the other Party. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to the extent that the Receiving Party is able to demonstrate that the Confidential Information:  
     
  (a)           was known by the Receiving Party or its Affiliates prior to its date of disclosure to the Receiving Party; or

  (a)           to the Receiving Party s respective employees, consultants and advisors, and to the employees, consultants and advisors of such Party s Affiliates, who have a need to know such information and materials for performing obligations or exercising rights expressly granted under this Agreement, provided that such Persons have an obligation to treat such information and materials as confidential consistent with this ARTICLE XIII;  
     
  (b)           to the Receiving Party s potential or actual investors, financers, or acquirers as may be necessary in connection with their evaluation of such potential or actual investment, financing, or acquisition; provided that such Persons shall be subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to such Confidential Information substantially similar to the obligations of confidentiality and non-use of the Receiving Party pursuant to this ARTICLE XIII.

Any information disclosed pursuant to this Section 13.3(d) remains the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.

borne and paid by the Company.  All Selling Expenses shall be borne by the Purchaser; or if there are other selling shareholders with shares being registered pursuant to such registration statement, then pro rata by the selling shareholders based on the number of shares sold by such selling shareholder in the offering.  
     
   (c)             For the purposes of this Section 5.11, 
     
   (i)                Losses   means any loss, damage, claim or liability (joint or several) to which a party hereto may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state law, insofar as such loss, damage, claim or liability  arises out of and is based upon: (A) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement of the Company registering the resale of the Registrable Shares, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or (B) an omission or alleged omission to state in such registration statement a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. 
     
   (ii)               Registrable Shares   means the Shares held by Purchaser including, without limitation, any Common Shares paid, issued or distributed in respect of any such Shares by way of stock dividend, stock split or distribution, or in connection with a combination of shares, recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or otherwise, but excluding Common Shares acquired in the open market before or after the date hereof, provided, however, that the Shares will not be  Registrable Shares  (A) after the Shares have been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or in compliance with Rule 144, (B) when the remaining Shares held by the Purchaser could, in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company, be sold by the Purchaser in a single transaction under the terms of this Agreement and the volume and manner of sale limitations under Rule 144, or (C) upon such time as the registration statement registering the resale of the Registrable Shares has been effective for forty two (42) months following the Lock-up Expiration Date (regardless of whether such months are consecutive). 
     
   (iii)             Selling Expenses   means the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Purchaser. 
     
   (d)             With a view to making available to the Purchaser the benefits of Rule 144, during the twelve (12) month period following the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, the Company covenants that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) file in a timely manner all reports and other documents required, if any, to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and (ii) make available information necessary to comply with Rule 144 with respect to resales of the Shares under the Securities Act, at all times, to the extent required from time to time to enable the Purchaser to resell Shares without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (A) Rule 144 (if available with respect to resales of the Shares), as such rule may be amended from time to time or (B) any other rules or regulations now existing or hereafter adopted by the SEC.

(e)             To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser, and the partners, members, officers and directors of the Purchaser and each Person, if any, who controls the Purchaser (collectively,   Purchaser Indemnified Parties  ), against any Losses, and the Company will pay to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties any legal or other reasonable and documented expenses incurred thereby in connection with investigating or defending any claim or proceeding from which Losses may result, as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 5.11(e) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, nor shall the Company be liable for any Losses to the extent that they arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of any Purchaser Indemnified Party expressly for use in connection with such registration. 
     
   (f)              Promptly after receipt by the Purchaser under this Section 5.11 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action) for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Purchaser Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Section 5.11, give the Company notice of the commencement thereof.  The Company shall have the right to participate in such action and, to the extent the Company so desires, and to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have the right to retain one separate counsel for all such Purchaser Indemnified Parties, with the reasonable and documented fees and expenses to be paid by the Company, if representation of the Purchaser by the counsel retained by the Company would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflict of interest between the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Company.  The failure to give notice to the Company within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall relieve the Company of any liability to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.11, only to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the Company s ability to defend such action.  The failure to give notice to the Company will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to the Purchaser otherwise than under this Section 5.11. 
     
   (g)             To provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, then such parties will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company and each Purchaser Indemnified Party in connection with the statements, omissions, or other actions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability, or expense, as well as to reflect any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of the Company and each Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact, or the omission or alleged omission of a material fact, relates to information supplied by the Company or by a Purchaser Indemnified Party and the parties  relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, however, that, in any such case (x) the Purchaser will not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of

 26   

all such Registrable Shares offered and sold by the Purchaser pursuant to such registration statement, and (y) no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  
     
   5.12           Participation in Future Financing . 
     
   (a)             Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, until the earlier of (i) such time as the Purchaser Transfers more than [**] of the Shares and (ii) termination of the Standstill Period, upon any issuance of Common Shares by the Company in a private placement to institutional investors for cash consideration (a   Subsequent Financing  ), the Company agrees at least [**] Trading Days prior to the closing of the Subsequent Financing, to deliver to the Purchaser written notice of its intention to effect a Subsequent Financing (the   Subsequent Financing Notice  ).  The Subsequent Financing Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the proposed terms of such Subsequent Financing, the amount of proceeds intended to be raised thereunder and the Person or Persons through or with whom such Subsequent Financing is proposed to be effected. Upon receipt of the Subsequent Financing Notice, the Company and the Purchaser shall in good faith discuss the Purchaser s participation in the Subsequent Financing up to the Purchaser s Pro-Rata Share (as defined below) on the same terms, conditions and price provided for in the Subsequent Financing. For purposes of this Agreement, the Purchaser s   Pro-Rata Share   shall be equal to the number of Common Shares deemed to be beneficially owned by the Purchaser immediately prior to the date of the Subsequent Financing Notice (based upon documentation or written representation reasonably satisfactory to the Company), divided by the total number of Common Shares outstanding (including any Common Shares issuable upon conversion or exercise of outstanding Common Share Equivalents deemed to be beneficially owned by the Purchaser and included in the numerator of its pre-Subsequent Financing Notice beneficial ownership calculation) immediately prior to the closing of the Subsequent Financing. 
     
   (b)             If the Purchaser desires to participate in such Subsequent Financing, the Purchaser must provide written notice to the Company, by not later than 5:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the [**] Trading Day after the Purchaser has received the Subsequent Financing Notice (the   Participation Deadline  ), that the Purchaser is willing to participate in the Subsequent Financing and stating the amount of the Purchaser s elected participation, but in no event shall such amount of Common Shares that would cause the Purchaser to exceed its Pro-Rata Share.  If the Company receives no such notice from the Purchaser as of the Participation Deadline, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have notified the Company that it does not elect to participate in the Subsequent Financing. 
     
   (c)             Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.12, it is understood and agreed that: (i) the foregoing agreement to engage in good faith discussions with respect to a Subsequent Financing only applies in the event of a private placement with institutional investors ( i.e. , not a public offering or in connection with a strategic transaction) and (ii) the Company will neither be obligated to include the Purchaser as an investor in any such private placement nor will the Purchaser be obligated to invest in any such private placement.

(d)             If, by the [**] day following delivery of the Subsequent Financing Notice, no public disclosure regarding a transaction with respect to the Subsequent Financing has been made, such Subsequent Financing shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the Purchaser shall not be in possession of any material, non-public information with respect to the Company, unless the Company advises the Purchaser that the Subsequent Financing has not been abandoned.  The Company understands and confirms that the Purchaser may rely on this Section 5.12(d) when effecting transactions in securities of the Company. 
     
   5.13           PFIC Reporting .  For so long as the Purchaser holds Shares, the Company hereby agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser in order to permit the Purchaser to determine whether the Company is at any time a  passive foreign investment company  (as defined in Section 1297(a) of the Code) (a   PFIC  ).  In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall notify the Purchaser if, in good faith, the Company reasonably believes the Company or any of its controlled Subsidiaries was a PFIC during the prior taxable year.  If the Company determines that the Company or any of its controlled subsidiaries is a PFIC, the Company shall (i) promptly after such determination notify the Purchaser, (ii) timely provide such information to the Purchaser as the Purchaser may reasonably request to enable the Purchaser to complete its U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 8621 with respect to such entity and (iii) use reasonable efforts to provide such statements, information and documentation as the Purchaser reasonably believes is necessary for it to make an election to treat such subsidiary as a  qualified electing fund  under Section 1295 of the Code. 
     
   5.14           Controlled Foreign Corporation . For so long as the Purchaser is a  United States shareholder  within the meaning of Section  951(b) of the Code (a   10% U.S. Shareholder  ) of the Company at any point during a taxable year, then the Company hereby agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser in order to permit the Purchaser to determine whether the Company is a  controlled foreign corporation  within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code (a   CFC  ).  If the Company is or is likely to have become a CFC, then the Company shall use reasonable efforts to provide to the Purchaser such information as it may reasonably request to assist the Purchaser to timely comply with its filing obligations under the Code, including but not limited to Internal Revenue Service Form 5471.
