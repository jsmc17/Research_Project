CAU    TIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS PURSUANT TO THE UNITED STATES PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 

Certain written and oral statements made by management of Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries ( we,   our,   us,   Paychex,  or the  Company ) may constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States ( U.S. ) Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words and phrases as  we expect,   expected to,   estimates,   estimated,   overview,   current outlook,   we look forward to,   would equate to,   projects,   projections,   projected to be,   anticipates,   anticipated,   we believe,   believes,   could be,  and other similar words or phrases. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding operating performance, events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, including statements relating to our outlook, revenue growth, earnings, earnings-per-share growth, or similar projections. 

Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy, and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict, many of which are outside our control. Our actual results and financial conditions may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance upon any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 

general     market   and economic conditions including, among others, changes in U.S. employment and wage levels, changes to new hiring trends, legislative changes to stimulate the economy, changes in short- and long-term interest rates, changes in the fair value and the credit rating of securities held by us, and accessibility of financing;     

changes in   demand   for our services and products, ability to develop and market new services and products effectively, pricing changes, and the impact of competition;     

changes in   the   availability of skilled workers, in particular those supporting our technology and product development;     

changes in   the   laws regulating collection and payment of payroll taxes, professional employer organizations ( PEOs ), and employee   benefits  , including retirement plans, workers  compensation, health insurance (including health care reform legislation), state unemployment, and section 125 plans;     

changes in   health   insurance and workers  compensation insurance rates and underlying claim trends;     

changes in   technology   that adversely affect our products and services and impact our ability to provide timely enhancements to services and products;     

the possibility of cyberattacks, security breaches, or other security vulnerabilities that could disrupt operations or expose confidential client data, and could also result in reduced revenues, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position;     

the   possibility   of failure of our operating facilities, or the failure of our computer systems, and communication systems during a catastrophic event;     

the   possibility   of third-party service providers failing to perform their functions;     

the   possibility   of a failure of internal controls or our inability to implement business process improvements;     

the possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or   omissions   of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations, including possible liability related to our co-employment relationship with our PEO;     

potenti  a  l outcomes related to pending or future litigation and legislative matters;     

the expected impacts of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the  Tax Act ); and

risks related to the integration of the businesses we acquire.     

Any of these factors, as well as such other factors as discussed in Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  and throughout Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of this Annual Report on Form 10   K ( Form 10-K ), as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), could cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results. The information provided in this Form 10   K is based upon the facts and circumstances known at this time, and any forward-looking statements made by us in this Form 10   K speak only as of the date on which they are made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements after the date of filing this Form 10-K with the SEC to reflect events or circumstances after such date, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

It    em 1.        Business 

Incorporated in Delaware in 1979, we are a leading provider of integrated human capital management ( HCM ) solutions for payroll, human resource ( HR ), retirement, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses. As of May 31, 2018, we served over 650,000 payroll clients. We maintain our corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and serve clients throughout the U.S. and Europe. We report our results of operations and financial condition as one business segment. Our fiscal year ends May 31st. 

Company Strategy 

Our mission is to be the leading provider of HCM solutions for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses by being an essential partner with America s businesses.  We believe that success in this mission will lead to strong, long-term financial performance.  Our business strategy focuses on the following: 

flexible, convenient service;     

industry-leading, integrated technology;     

providing a comprehensive suite of value-added HCM services;     

solid sales execution;     

continued service penetration; and     

engaging in strategic acquisitions, when possible.     

Our Clients 

The target market for our integrated HCM solutions is in the small- to mid-market space. Within this space, we serve a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the U.S. and Europe. Our clients have the option to select the HCM modules they need with the ability to easily add services as they grow. They can also opt for our comprehensive HR and payroll outsourcing solutions, Paychex HR Services. This flexibility allows our clients to define the solution that best meets their needs. We utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018 ( fiscal 2018 ), client retention was approximately 81% of our beginning client base for the fiscal year, consistent with a year ago. 

We support our small-business clients in reducing the complexity and risk of running their own payroll, while ensuring greater accuracy with up-to-date tax rates and regulatory information. We simplify their payroll with a combination of our dynamic products and customer service options for a quick and easy payday. Clients can choose to have our service team handle everything for them, or can process payroll themselves utilizing our robust Paychex Flex      processing platform or SurePayroll       online applications. Both products are cloud-based software-as-a-service ( SaaS ) solutions that allow users to do payroll when they want, how they want, and on any device (desktop, tablet, and mobile phone). 

With an environment of increasing regulations, the need for HR outsourcing services is moving down-market.  Our small-business clients benefit from our time and attendance products, which allow them to accurately and efficiently manage the gathering and recording of employee hours worked.  Our advanced suite of time and attendance products, including web and mobile tools, assist companies with the scheduling, tracking, and reporting of time.  

Our mid-market clients have more complex payroll and employee benefit needs. Our mid-market clients are serviced through our Paychex Flex Enterprise solution, which offers an integrated suite of HCM solutions on the Paychex Flex platform, or through our legacy platform.  All new clients are sold on the Paychex Flex platform.  Clients using Paychex Flex Enterprise are offered a SaaS solution that integrates payroll processing with HR management, employee benefits administration, time and labor management, applicant tracking, and onboarding solutions.  Paychex Flex Enterprise allows mid-market clients to choose the services and software they need to meet the complexity of the business and have them integrated through one HCM solution.

Description of Services 

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of HCM services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and HR needs. Clients can select services on an   la carte basis or as part of various product bundles. Our offerings often leverage the information gathered in our base payroll processing service, allowing us to provide comprehensive outsourcing services covering the HCM spectrum. 

Our portfolio of HCM and employee benefit-related services are comprised of the following:  

Payroll processing services:   Payroll processing services include the calculation, preparation, and delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal accounting records and management reports; preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection and remittance of clients  payroll obligations.      

Payroll tax administration services:   Our payroll tax administration services provide for accurate preparation and timely filing of quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic transfer of funds to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies (federal, state, and local). In connection with these services, we electronically collect payroll   taxes   from clients  bank accounts, typically on payday, prepare and file the applicable tax returns, and remit taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with some items extending up to 90 days. We handle regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes.     

Employee payment services:   Our employee payment services provide an employer with the option of paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a check drawn on a Paychex account (Readychex     ), or a check drawn on the employer s account and electronically signed by us. For each of the first three methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the clients  bank accounts, typically one business day before payday, and provide payment to the employees on payday. Same day ACH functionality is also available for clients using direct deposit, allowing employers the flexibility to pay employees via direct deposit on the same day they initiate payroll. Our Readychex service provides a cost-effective solution that offers the benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation for employers.     

Regulatory compliance services:   We offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to comply with federal and state requirements to report information on newly hired employees. This information aids the government in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent unemployment and workers  compensation insurance claims. Our garnishment processing service provides deductions from employees  pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies, including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the obligations to fulfillment. These services enable employers to comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties.     

Paychex HR Services:   We offer comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions that provide businesses a full-service approach to the outsourcing of employer and employee administrative needs. Our Paychex HR Services offering is available through Paychex HR Solutions, an administrative services organization ( ASO ), or Paychex PEO. Both options offer businesses a combined package of services that includes payroll, employer compliance, HR and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and the on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative. These comprehensive bundles of services are designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their payroll and related benefit costs while providing a benefits package that is competitive with those offered by larger companies. Clients are also assigned a dedicated HR professional called a human resources generalist, or HRG. Available to meet onsite, the HRG helps clients navigate obligations related to federal and state regulations, and supports employers with workforce functions such as hiring, training, and workplace safety. We believe HRGs differentiate us in the marketplace.      

Our PEO differs from the ASO in that we serve as a co-employer of our clients  employees, offer health care coverage to PEO client employees, and assume the risks and rewards of workers  compensation insurance and certain health insurance offerings. PEO services are sold through our registered and licensed subsidiary, Paychex Business Solutions, LLC and HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc., which was acquired in August 2017. We are certified under the Small Business Efficiency Act to provide PEO services. We also offer Paychex HR Essentials, which is an ASO product that provides support to our clients over the phone or online to help manage employee-related topics.  As of May 31, 2018, Paychex HR Services was utilized by approximately 41,000 clients with approximately 1,157,000 client worksite employees.

Retirement services administration:   Our retirement services product line offers a variety of options to clients, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE plans, SIMPLE IRAs, 401(k) plans with safe harbor provisions, owner-only 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, and money purchase plans. These services provide plan implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations, employee and employer reporting, participant and employer online access, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative services. Auto enrollment is an optional plan feature that allows employers to automatically enroll employees in their company s 401(k) plan and increase overall plan participation. Clients have the ability to choose from a group of pre-defined fund selections or to customize their investment options within their plan. We are the largest 401(k) recordkeeper for small businesses in the U.S. Our large-market retirement services clients include relationships with financial advisors. As of May 31, 2018, retirement services covered approximately 82,000 plans and the asset value of participants' funds externally managed totaled approximately $30.6 billion.     

Insurance services:   Our licensed insurance agency, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., provides insurance through a variety of carriers, while allowing employers to expand their employee benefit offerings at an affordable cost. Insurance offerings include property and casualty coverage such as workers  compensation, business-owner policies, commercial auto, and health and benefits coverage, including health, dental, vision, and life. Our insurance services simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find plans with the features and affordability to meet the client s needs. With access to numerous top national and regional insurance carriers, our professional insurance agents have access to a wide selection of plans from which they can best match the insurance needs of small businesses. Additionally, clients have the option to integrate their insurance plans with Paychex payroll processing for easy, accurate plan administration.     

We also offer comprehensive solutions to help employers and employees with certain mandates under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ), which sets forth specific coverage and reporting requirements that employers must meet.  Our Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility ( ESR ) Service is aimed at helping clients: 1) determine if the ACA s ESR provision applies to them; 2) provide ongoing ACA analysis and monitoring, along with automatic alerts, of their employees and hours worked; 3) evaluate if their health care offering meets the minimum coverage requirement; and 4) prepare and file end-of-year reporting. 

HR administration services:   We offer cloud-based HR administration software products for employee benefits management and administration, time and attendance solutions, recruiting, and onboarding. Paychex HR Online offers powerful tools for managing employee benefits, personnel information, and HR compliance and reporting. Our BeneTrac service manages the employee-benefit enrollment process. Our time and attendance products, including our integrated Flex Time software, provides timekeeping, scheduling, and workforce analytics. These services allow the employer to handle multiple payroll scenarios, improving productivity, accuracy, and reliability in the payroll process. In fiscal 2018, we introduced the InVision  TM   IRIS Time Clock, a biometric clock that scans the iris, providing fast and accurate time capture. Our expense reporting solution is a web-based solution that provides clients with tools to manage and control the expense reporting process. The applicant tracking suite provides technology that streamlines, simplifies, and drives the applicant workflow and onboarding process for companies of all sizes.     

Other HR services and products:   We offer the outsourcing of plan administration under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code, allowing employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for certain health insurance benefits and health and dependent care expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation, administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement, and coverage tests are provided with these services. We offer state unemployment insurance services, which provide clients with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations, change statements, and requests for separation documents. Other products include employee handbooks, management manuals, and personnel and required regulatory forms. These products are designed to simplify clients  administrative processes all while enhancing their employee benefits programs.     

Accounting and Financial Services:   We offer various accounting and financial services to small- to medium-sized businesses. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Paychex Advance, LLC, provides a portfolio of services to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding (via the purchase of accounts receivable) and outsourcing services, which include payroll processing, invoicing, and tax preparation. We recently launched Paychex Promise, a subscription-based service that offers protection against payroll interruptions and solutions to address routine challenges of running a successful business.  The primary offering is payroll protection, which extends the collection of payroll funds from a client s bank account by seven days without interruption of service or charges for insufficient funds.  In addition, through partnerships with third-party providers, we provide clients opportunities for services such as payment processing services, financial fitness programs, and a small-business loan resource center.

Sales and Marketing 

We market and sell our services primarily through our direct sales force based in the metropolitan markets we serve. Our direct sales force includes sales representatives who have defined geographical territories and specialize within our portfolio of services. Our sales representatives are also supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, trade shows, and telemarketing programs. We utilize a virtual sales force to service geographical areas where we may not have a local presence, cover inbound leads for certain small-business clients, or for products for which we do not have a local sales force. 

In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we utilize other indirect sales channels such as our relationships with existing clients, certified public accountants ( CPAs ), and banks for new client referrals. Greater than 50% of our new small-market payroll clients (excluding business acquisitions) come from these referral sources. Our dedicated business development group drives sales through banking, national associations, and franchise channels.  We also utilize digital marketing as a means to market our services. 

We have a long-standing partnership with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ( AICPA ) as the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business Solutions  TM   Program. Our current partnership agreement with the AICPA is in place through September 2021.  We also partner with various state CPA society organizations. 

Our website, which is available at   www.paychex.com  , includes online payroll sales presentations and service and product information.  It also serves as a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of leads and new sales, while complementing the efforts of our direct and virtual sales forces. This online tool allows us to market to clients and prospective clients in other geographical areas where we do not have a direct sales presence. In addition, the insurance services section of our website, which is accessible at   www.paychex.com/group-health-insurance  , provides information to help small businesses navigate the insurance industry, and generates leads by allowing interested parties to get in contact with one of our professional insurance agents. 

Paychex also builds on its reputation as an expert in the HCM industry by providing education and assistance to clients and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impacts of regulatory change. We track current regulatory issues that impact the business community and provide a monthly regulatory update. Our Paychex Accountant Knowledge Center is a free online resource available through our website that brings valuable information and time-saving online tools to accounting professionals. Through the Paychex Flex online platform, AccountantHQ offers access to authorized client payroll and HR data and key account contacts, along with an extensive accountant resource library. AccountantHQ drives efficiency by putting accountants in the best position possible to easily access critical client payroll and HR data and powerful reporting tools. Our Paychex WORX website, available at   www.paychex.com/worx  , is a digital destination for insightful resources useful for businesses at every stage, from entrepreneur to enterprise. Paychex WORX highlights the breadth of our product line, expertise, and ability to help businesses of all sizes with a wide range of HR and financial information for current clients and prospects alike.

We remain focused on servicing small- to medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve. Our internal database source indicates that there are approximately 11 million addressable businesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the U.S. Of those businesses, approximately 99% have fewer than 100 employees and comprise our primary customers and target market. We believe that there is opportunity for us in the HCM market as the demand is moving down-market to smaller businesses.  

The market for HCM services is highly competitive and fragmented. We have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national, regional, local, and online service providers. In addition to traditional payroll processing and HR service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and HR systems and departments. Payroll and HR systems and software are sold by many vendors. Human Resource Services ( HRS ) products also compete with a variety of providers of HR services, such as retirement services companies, insurance companies, and HR and benefits consulting firms. 

Competition in the payroll processing and HR services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality and reputation, including ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of service and product offerings, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas.  We believe that our excellent customer service, together with our leading-edge technology and mobility applications, distinguishes us from our competitors. 

Software Maintenance and Development 

The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and HR services to our clients. We are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace. We continue to enhance our SaaS solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience.  Continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success. 

Employees 

We believe our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business is important to our future success and growth. As of May 31, 2018, we employed approximately 14,300 people.  None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. 

Intellectual Property 

We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Taken as a whole, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the  Paychex  name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us. 

Seasonality 

There is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients, and new Paychex HR Services worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying year-end bonuses and requesting additional year-end services.  

Available Information 

We are subject to the informational and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. Such reports may be read and copied at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549.

It    em 1A.        Risk Factors 

Our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results, and from our projections. The risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect, possibly to a material extent, our business, cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods. In addition, you should refer to the description of forward-looking statements at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K. 

Our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies.      Many of our services, particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services, are designed according to government regulations that continually change, for example, the ambiguity surrounding the Department of Labor s fiduciary rule for retirement plan service. Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue. Added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business. Failure to educate and assist our clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse impact on our reputation. Failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Our business and reputation may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations  .  Our services are subject to various laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the ACA and Anti-Money Laundering rules. The growth of our international operations via acquisition also subjects us to additional risks, such as compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and United Kingdom Bribery Act. As of this fiscal year, the financial impact of our international operations to our overall business has been insignificant. However, over time, our international operations may grow and increase their significance to our business. Uncertainty regarding the potential future modifications of existing laws and regulations can also adversely affect our business. There is uncertainty regarding the potential future evolution and modification of the ACA. Failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the area of health care reform as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  We have policies and procedures to monitor our compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations throughout the business and our acquisitions. 

We may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services  .  The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advancements, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions, and enhancements and changing industry standards. To maintain our growth strategy, we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients. Our future success will depend on our ability to: enhance our current products and introduce new products in order to keep pace with products offered by our competitors; enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems, particularly our systems that meet our clients  requirements; and adapt to technological advancements and changing industry standards. We continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology. If our systems become outdated, we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry. There can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful. If we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner, or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results, there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations.

Our reputation, results of operations, or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy laws and regulations.    Our services require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees, including personal or identifying information, as well as their financial and payroll data.  Our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal, state, and local levels, including those governing personal privacy.  In the U.S., we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, the ACA, federal and state labor and employment laws, and state data breach notification laws. In addition, the European Union s General Data Privacy Regulation became fully effective in May 2018. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. The regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. 

We could be subject to reduced revenues, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position as a result of cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities or Internet disruptions.    We rely upon information technology ( IT ) networks, cloud-based platforms, and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to support a variety of business processes.  Cyberattacks and security threats are a risk to our business and reputation.  A privacy or IT security breach could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Data Security and Privacy Leaks  :  We collect, use, and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients, employees of our clients, and our employees, including:  bank account numbers, credit card numbers, social security numbers, tax return information, health care information, retirement account information, payroll information, system and network passwords, and other sensitive personal and business information.  At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security.  Vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. 

Our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premise or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment that we host.  The security of our IT infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers  purchasing decisions.   Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventative or responsive measures.    As cyber threats continue to evolve, we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information.   We may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls, and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.   While we have security systems and IT infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information, if our security measures are breached, our business could be substantially harmed and we could incur significant liabilities. Any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us, result in reputational damage, and subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines, or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.  Third parties, including vendors that provide services for our operations, could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.  

Data Loss and Business Interruption  :    If our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, including Internet or systems failure, or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons, both the Company and our clients could experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future. Such events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation, regulatory investigation and penalties, loss of clients  business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

In the event of a catastrophe, our business continuity plan may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations.      Our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster, severe weather including events resulting from climate change, unauthorized security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events. Our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather, including hurricanes, floods, and snowstorms, and has been successful. However, these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future. If the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients.

We may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party service providers to perform their functions.      As part of providing services to clients, we rely on a number of third-party service providers. These service providers include, but are not limited to, couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees. Failure by these service providers, for any reason, to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us. 

We may be exposed to additional risks related to our co-employment relationship within our PEO business.      Many federal and state laws that apply to the employer-employee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the  co-employment  relationship. As a result, there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees, who may be deemed to be our agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations. Although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees  conduct, we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations. In addition, we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the  employer  under any applicable state or federal laws. 

We may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers  compensation rates and underlying claims trends.      Within our PEO business, we maintain health and workers  compensation insurance covering worksite employees. The insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our PEO costs. If we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity, our costs could increase. In addition, in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts, we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms. Also, as a co-employer in the PEO, we assume or share many of the employer-related responsibilities associated with health care reform, which may result in increased costs.  Increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients. 

Our clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we have made on their behalf, resulting in financial loss to us.    As part of the payroll processing service, we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities.  It is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them.  We have in the past, and may in the future, make payments on our clients  behalf for which we may not be reimbursed, resulting in loss to us. 

Our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance.      We receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. A change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact interest income. 

We may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment.      Trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability. When there is a slowdown in the economy, employment levels and interest rates may decrease or become more volatile. These conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business. Current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services. In addition, new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit.  

We invest our funds held for clients in high quality, investment-grade marketable securities, money markets, and other cash equivalents. However, these funds held for clients are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks.  These risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility.  The interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates. In addition, during periods of volatility in the credit markets, certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in, further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds.  

Constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings. Historically, we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet short-term liquidity needs. However, should we require additional short-term liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds, a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us. Growth in services for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited.  If all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We may not be able to attract and retain qualified people, which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction.    Our success, growth, and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified people at all levels, including management, technical, compliance, and sales personnel. Competition for these individuals can be intense, and we may not be able to retain our key people, or attract, assimilate, or retain other highly-qualified individuals in the future, which could harm our future success. 

Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly.    Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases. Our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by employees or third parties.  To the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other means, other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property, including former employees, may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others  advantage. Competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products. Any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand, and may adversely affect our ability to compete. 

We are involved in litigation from time to time arising from the operation of our business and, as such, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees or other costs.   We are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees or other third parties for various actions. From time to time, we are involved in litigation involving claims related to, among other things, breach of contract, tortious conduct and employment and labor law matters. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk:      Refer to Item 7A of this Form 10-K for a discussion on Market Risk Factors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Facilities outside of Rochester, New York are at various locations throughout the U.S. and house our branch and sales offices, regional service centers, multi-product service centers, and data processing centers. These locations are concentrated in metropolitan areas. Our international locations primarily house our European branch and sales locations. We believe that adequate, suitable lease space will continue to be available to meet our needs.

We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of our business. These include disputes or potential disputes related to breach of contract, tort, patent, breach of fiduciary duty, employment-related claims, tax claims, and other matters. 

Our management currently believes that resolution of outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position and the results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

In fiscal 2018, an additional expense and corresponding tax benefit was recognized as a result of the termination of certain license agreements. Refer to Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , and Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K, for additional discussion of the impact of the termination of certain license agreements.     

(3) 

In fiscal 2017, we early-adopted new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation payments. As a result, a discrete tax benefit was recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. This increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.04 per diluted share and $0.05 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.     

(4) 

In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 ( fiscal 2016 ), a net tax benefit was recorded for income derived in prior tax years from customer-facing software we produced. This increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.06 per share.     

(5) 

During fiscal 2016, we adopted new accounting guidance related to the presentation of deferred taxes within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result, a reclassification of prior year deferred tax amounts was made to conform to the May 31, 2016 p  resentation of deferred taxes within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the table above, a similar reclassification was made, which impacted total assets.

Our financial results for fiscal   2018   reflect another year of steady growth.  HRS revenue continued to experience strong growth of 14% for fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. HRS revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in client bases across the following HCM services:  comprehensive HR outsourcing services, including HR Outs  ourcing Holdings, Inc. ( HROI )   acquired in fiscal 2018; retirement services; time and attendance; and insurance services.  Payroll service revenue increased 2% for fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017, primarily driven by growth in revenue per check, which improved as a result of our price increases, net of discounts. As of May 31, 2018, including the Lessor Group ( Lessor ) acquisition, we served over 650,000 payroll clients.  As of May 31, 2017, we served approximately 605,000 payroll clients.  Client retention was approximately 81% of our beginning client base for the fiscal year, consistent with a year ago. 

Interest rates available on high-quality financial instruments are gradually increasing. Our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.5% for fiscal 2018, compared to 1.2% for fiscal 2017 and 1.1% for fiscal 2016.  The United States ( U.S. ) Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by a total of 75 basis points during fiscal 2018 to a range of 1.50% to 1.75% as of May 31, 2018.  In June 2018, the Federal Funds rate was raised an additional 25 basis points to a range of 1.75% to 2.0%.  The Federal Funds rate was in the range of 0.75% to 1.0% as of May 31, 2017.  

Highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017, are as follows: 

Total   revenue increased 7% to $3.4 billion.     

o 

Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $1.8 billion.     

o 

Interest   on funds held for clients increased 26% to $63.5 million.     

Operating   income increased 4% to $1.3 billion.  Adjusted operating income  (1)   increased 6% to $1.3 billion.     

Dividends   of $739.7 million were paid to stockholders, representing 79% of net income.

Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) measures.  Please refer to the  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section of this Item 7 for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share.      

Business Outlook 

Our payroll client base, including Lessor, exceeded 650,000 clients as of May 31, 2018, and was approximately 605,000 clients as of May 31, 2017 and May 31, 2016.  Excluding Lessor, our payroll client base was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. 

While HRS   products provide   services to employers and employees beyond payroll, they effectively leverage payroll processing data.  Our HR administration services are included as part of the integrated HCM solution within Paychex Flex.  The following table illustrates the growth in selected HRS service offerings:

In fiscal 2018, we expanded our commitment to delivering superior technology and service solutions to our Paychex clients.  New offerings introduced in fiscal 2018 included:  

Accountant HQ, a Paychex Flex platform-based offering, which provides access to authorized client payroll and HR data and key account contacts to assist a client s accountant in driving greater efficiency;     

InVision  TM   Iris Time Clock, a biometric clock that scans the iris, providing fast and accurate time capture;     

Netspend s Tip Network  TM  , which streamlines the process for paying tipped employees;     

Do-It-Yourself online employee handbook; and     

Onboarding Essentials, which enables clients to onboard new hires quickly and in a completely paperless fashion.     

Concentrated effort remains on the continued enhancements of Paychex Flex, our robust cloud-based HCM platform, which allows direct client access to payroll, HR, and benefits information in a streamlined and integrated approach to workplace management.  

We continue to strengthen our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients, small businesses, and other interested parties.  We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes.  The Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. website,   www.paychex.com/group-health-insurance  , helps small-business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage.  Both this website and   www.paychex.com/worx     have sections dedicated to the topic of health care reform. 

Financial position and liquidity 

Our financial position as of   May 31, 2018   remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of   $719.7   million and no debt. Our investment strategy continues to focus on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity.  We invest predominately in municipal bonds   including general obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a U.S. government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds   along with U.S. government agency securities and corporate bonds. During fiscal   2018  , our primary short-term investment vehicles were Variable Rate Demand Notes ( VRDNs ) and bank demand deposit accounts. 

A majority of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of AA or higher, and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair values are less sensitive to interest rate changes. We believe that our investments as of   May 31, 2018   that were in an unrealized loss position were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other-than-temporary impairment. 

Our primary source of cash is generated by our ongoing operations. Cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for fiscal 2018.   Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, business acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividend payments from our operating activities.  Our positive operating cash flows for fiscal   2018   allowed us to support our business and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders. In April 2018 and July 2017, our Board of Directors (the  Board ) increased our quarterly dividend by 12% to $0.56 per share from $0.50 per share, and 9% to $0.50 per share from $0.46 per share, respectively.  Dividends paid to stockholders were 79% of net income for fiscal 2018. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of   May 31, 2018  , along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, share repurchases, dividend payments, and business acquisitions, if any, for the foreseeable future. 

For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years   2018  ,    2017  , and   2016  , and our financial position as of   May 31, 2018  , refer to the tables and analysis in the  Results of Operations  and  Liquidity and Capital Resources  sections of this Item 7 and the discussion in the  Critical Accounting Policies  section of this Item 7.

Results of Operations 

Summary of Results of Operations for Fiscal Years: 

We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of May 31, 2018, we had no exposure to high-risk or illiquid investments. Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:

Table of Contents  

Payroll service revenue:    Payroll service revenue was $1.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and $1.8 billion for fiscal 2017, reflecting growth of 2% and 3%, respectively, compared to each of the prior fiscal year periods.  Both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from increases in revenue per check, which improved as a result of price increases, net of discounts.  The impact of the acquisition of Lessor on payroll service revenue growth for fiscal 2018 was insignificant.  The acquisition of Paychex Advance contributed approximately 1% to payroll service revenue growth for fiscal 2017. 

As of May 31, 2018, including the Lessor acquisition, we served over 650,000 payroll clients.  For fiscal 2017, our total payroll client base of 605,000 was comparable to fiscal 2016.  Client retention was approximately 81% of the beginning client base for fiscal 2018, consistent with fiscal 2017.  Client retention was approximately 82% of the beginning of the year client base for fiscal 2016. 

Human Resource Services revenue:    HRS revenue was $1.5 billion for fiscal 2018 and $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017, reflecting growth of 14% and 12%, respectively, compared to each of the prior fiscal year periods. HROI contributed approximately 6% to the growth in HRS revenue for fiscal 2018 and Paychex Advance contributed approximately 1% to the growth in HRS revenue for fiscal 2017. 

For both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, HRS revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in client bases across all major HCM services, including: comprehensive HR outsourcing services (including HROI), retirement services, time and attendance, and insurance services.      HRS product key statistics are as follows: 

(1)   The total number of worksite employees and clients for fiscal 2018 include HROI. 

We continue to experience strong demand for our Paychex HR Services, our largest HRS revenue stream, as evidenced by the continued strong growth in client worksite employees for both our ASO and PEO. Retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value of participant funds, along with an increase in the number of plans served. Insurance services revenue growth for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from growth in the number of health and benefits applicants.  In addition, for fiscal 2017, revenue was positively impacted by higher average premiums in our workers  compensation insurance product. 

Total service revenue:    Total service revenue increased 7% for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, attributable to the factors previously discussed.  

Interest on funds held for clients:    Interest on funds held for clients increased 26% for fiscal 2018 and 10% for fiscal 2017 to $63.5 million and $50.6 million, respectively.  For both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the increases were primarily due to higher average interest rates earned. 

Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased approximately 1% for fiscal 2018, primarily due to the impact of the   Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the  Tax Act )   on employee withholdings and changes in client mix, which offset the impact of wage inflation.  Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased approximately 1% for fiscal 2017 primarily due to the impacts of timing of certain remittances due to taxing authorities and client mix.   

Refer to the  Market Risk Factors  section contained in Item 7A of this Form 10-K for more information on changing interest rates.

Combined operating and SG A expenses:    The following table summarizes total combined operating and SG A expenses for fiscal years: 

Total expenses increased 10% for fiscal 2018 and 6% for fiscal 2017.  For fiscal 2018, compensation-related expenses increased due to higher headcount reflecting accelerated investment in technology, sales teams, and the impact of the acquisitions of Lessor and HROI.  In addition, compensation-related expenses in fiscal 2018 included a one-time bonus paid to non-management employees.  For fiscal 2017, compensation-related expenses increased due to higher headcount in operations, partially offset by lower variable selling costs. As of May 31, 2018, we had approximately 14,300 employees, including Lessor, compared with 13,700 employees as of May 31, 2017. 

Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight-line or accelerated methods.  The increase in depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in internally developed software that was placed in service over the past two years as well as changes to the useful life of certain assets which accelerated depreciation expense recognition. 

Expense growth for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was impacted by continued growth in our PEO. Other expenses include items such as non-capital equipment, delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business.  Continued investment in product development and supporting technology impacted other expense growth for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.  For fiscal 2018, other expenses also reflect a one-time expense of $32.6 million related to the termination of certain license agreements.  In addition, the combined acquisitions of HROI and Lessor contributed approximately 5% to the total expense growth for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.  The acquisition of Paychex Advance contributed approximately 1% to the growth in total expenses for fiscal 2017.  

Operating income:    Operating income increased 4% to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2018 and 8% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017.   The fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed.  Operating income, as a percent of total revenue, was 38.1%, 39.3%, and 38.8% for the fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2018 and 8% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017.  See th  e  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section of this Item 7 for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure. 

Investment income, net:    Investment income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. Investment income, net, increased 66% for fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher average interest rates earned.  The increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2018 was the result of higher net income partially offset by share repurchases, business acquisitions, and an increase in the rate for quarterly dividend payments.  Investment income, net, increased 13% for fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher average interest rates earned, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average investment balances. 

Income taxes:    Our effective income tax rate was 28.0% for fiscal 2018 and was 34.3% for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.  The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was significantly impacted by the Tax Act.  As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a non-recurring net tax benefit of $25.5 million for fiscal 2018 for the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities. This amount impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 per share for fiscal 2018.  In addition, as it relates to the Tax Act, our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 benefited from a reduced statutory tax rate applied to our current year taxable income.  The effective income tax rates were impacted by additional discrete tax items recognized during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016.  Effective June 1, 2016, we early-adopted new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation payments which resulted in discrete tax benefits recognized in income tax expense.  This discrete tax benefit impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.04 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 and $0.05 per diluted share for fiscal 2017.  During fiscal 2018, we recognized a tax benefit as a result of the termination of certain license agreements, which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per diluted share.  During fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income derived in prior tax years related to customer-facing software that we produced which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.06 per diluted share.  Additional discrete tax items recognized during each respective period are insignificant.  Refer to Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional disclosures on income taxes.

Net income and diluted earnings per share:        Net income increased 14% to $933.7 million for fiscal 2018 and   8% to $817.3 million for fiscal 2017.  Diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.58 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 and 8% to $2.25 per diluted share for fiscal 2017.  These fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed.   Adjusted net income increased 15% to $920.0 million for fiscal 2018 and increased 9% to $799.0 million for fiscal 2017.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.55 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 and $2.20 per diluted share for fiscal 2017, reflecting increases of 16% and 8%, respectively.  Refer to the  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section that follows for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:   A  djusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are summarized as follows: 

(1) 

Additional expense and corresponding tax benefit recognized as a result of the termination of certain license agreements.  This event is not expected to recur.     

(2) 

Net tax windfall or shortfall benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments recognized in income taxes.  This item is subject to volatility and will vary based on employee decisions on exercising employee stock options and fluctuations in our stock price, neither of which is within the control of management.     

(3) 

Non-recurring net tax benefit recognized on income derived in prior tax years related to customer-facing software that we produced.     

(4) 

Non-recurring tax benefits recognized as a result of the Tax Act related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities.     

(5) 

The calculation of the impact of non-GAAP adjustments on diluted earnings per share is performed on each line independently.  The table above may not add down by +/- $0.01 due to rounding.

Table of Contents  

In addition to reporting operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures.  We believe adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are appropriate additional measures, as they are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period.  Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not calculated through the application of GAAP and are not a required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  As such, they should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measures of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, and therefore should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measures.  The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our financial position as of   May 31, 2018   remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of   $719.7   million and no debt. We believe that our investments in an unrealized loss position as of   May 31, 2018   were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any other-than-temporary impairment. We anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of   May 31, 2018  , along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, business acquisitions, if any, share repurchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future. 

Short-Term Financing 

We maintain   credit facilities, letters of credit, and lines of credit as part of our normal and recurring business operations. 

Credit Facilities:    We maintain three committed, unsecured credit facilities as follows: 

(1) 

Borrower is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.     

(2) 

JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( JPM ) acts as the administrative agent for this syndicated credit facility.     

For all credit facilities, obligations under any facility are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and will 

bear interest at competitive rates based on options provided to the borrower.  Upon the expiration date, any borrowings outstanding will mature and be payable on such date  . 

JPM $1 Billion Credit Facility:    There were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility as of May 31, 2018.  Details of borrowings under this credit facility are   as follows: 

22   

Table of Contents  

We typically borrow on an overnight basis.  In addition to overnight borrowings, we also borrowed: 

Subsequent to May 31, 2018, we borrowed two times, on an overnight basis, $171.8 million on a weighted-average basis 

under this line. 

JPM $500 Million Credit Facility:    There were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility as of May 31, 2018.  Details of borrowings under this credit facility   are as follows: 

In addition to overnight borrowings, during fiscal 2018, we borrowed $300.0 million for seven days and $75.0 million for 30 days at weighted average LIBOR-based interest rates of 2.13% and 2.19%, respectively.  Subsequent to May 31, 2018, we borrowed three times, on an overnight basis, $103.5 million on a weighted-average basis under this line. 

PNC $150 Million Credit Facility:    There were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility as of May 31, 2018.  Details of borrowings under this credit facility   are as follows: 

Subsequent to May 31, 2018, we borrowed approximately $56.8 million under this line, which remains outstanding as of the date of this report. 

All of our credit facilities contain various financial and operational covenants that are usual and customary for such arrangements. We were in compliance with all of these covenants as of May 31, 2018. 

Certain lenders under these credit facilities, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform for us, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting, and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will continue to receive in the future, customary fees and expenses. 

Letters of credit:    As of   May 31, 2018  , we had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling   $56.8   million, required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between July 2018 and May 2019. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2018 or as of May 31, 2018.    Subsequent to May 31, 2018,   the letter of credit expiring in July 2018 was renewed through July 2019, and the total amount available under th  e letters of credit was increased $4.1 million to $60.9 million  . 

Lines of credit:   Effective August 17, 2017, we terminated four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit totaling $900.0 million.  The   lines of credit were available to us at market rates of interest and were primarily used to meet short-term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions made on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business.  There were no   amounts outstanding under these lines of credit during fiscal 2018 or as of May 31, 2018.  We do not have any other open lines of credit as of the date of this report.

Table of Contents  

Other commitments:    We have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under GAAP, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   May 31, 2018  . The table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of   May 31, 2018  : 

(1) 

Operating leases are primarily for office space and equipment used in our branch operations.     

(2) 

Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and services and legally binding contractual arrangements with future payment obligations. Included in the total purchase obligations is   $6.7   million of commitments to purchase capital assets. Amounts actually paid under certain of these arrangements may be different due to variable components of these agreements.     

The liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, was approximately   $14.7   million as of   May 31, 2018  . Refer to Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on income taxes. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above.  

Certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long-term liabilities reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets amounting to   $84.8   million as of   May 31, 2018   are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments.  In addition, during fiscal 2017 we entered into a limited partnership agreement to contribute a maximum amount of $10.0 million to a venture capital fund in the financial technology sector, of which approximately $4.2 million has been contributed as of   May 31, 2018  .  The timing of future contributions to be made to the venture capital fund cannot be specifically or reasonably determined and thus have been excluded from the table above. 

In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us. 

We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and are not material as of the reporting date. We also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance company. 

In August 2017, we announced our plan for a new multi-building Paychex campus based in Rochester, NY.  This involves the purchase of five buildings and the renovation of over 300,000 square feet of existing space for an estimated cost of $60.0 million.  We completed the purchase of these buildings during the three months ended November 30, 2017, for a combined cost of approximately $34.7 million and placed approximately $16.0 million in escrow for the building renovations, which are in-process.  Renovations on the buildings purchased are in-process, and are expected to be substantially completed during the fiscal year ending May 31, 2019. In addition, in September 2017, we entered into a transaction with the County of Monroe Industrial Development Agency for purposes of obtaining public benefits and inducements, expiring on December 31, 2039.  The public inducements include exemption from sales and use taxes for goods and services directly related to the renovations of the new multi-building campus.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do maintain investments as a limited partner in both low-income housing projects and a venture capital fund focused on the financial technology sector.  These are not considered part of our ongoing operations. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and represented less than one percent of our total assets as of   May 31, 2018  .

Operating Cash Flow Activities 

The increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal   2018   compared to fiscal   2017   is the result of higher net income and adjustments for non-cash items, and an increase in cash provided by fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in net income in fiscal   2018   was impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act.  The decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal   2017   compared to fiscal   2016   is primarily the result of net cash outflows from fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income and adjustments for non-cash items.  The increase in non-cash adjustments for fiscal   2018   and for fiscal   2017   was largely due to higher depreciation expense related to an increase in internally developed software placed in service over the last three years.  The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between all periods were impacted by the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.  In addition, the larger outflows in fiscal 2017 were impacted by higher accounts receivable balances related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing agency clients.     

Investing Cash Flow Activities 

Funds held for clients and corporate investments:    Funds held for clients consist of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. The portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

Fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investments are largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio.  Specific timing impacting cash flows for fiscal years   2018  ,    2017  , and   2016   are discussed further in the financing cash flows discussion of net changes in client fund obligations.  Fiscal   2018   and fiscal   2017   had greater purchases of short-term or available-for-sale investments of client collections than sales of investments to fund client fund remittances, whereas fiscal 2016 reflected more sales of investments than purchases.  For fiscal   2016  , the client fund timing impacts reflected in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investments were somewhat offset by a change in mix of investments.  Fiscal 2016 had more funds invested in VRDN securities and less in cash equivalents. 

In general, fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investments primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services.  Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the  Market Risk Factors  section contained in Item 7A of this Form 10-K. 

Other investing activities:    To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal years   2018  ,    2017  , and   2016  , we purchased approximately   $0.5   million,   $0.6   million, and   $4.9   million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation. The former Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board. 

The net cash outflow for purchases of property and equipment during fiscal 2018 includes the purchase of five buildings and ongoing renovations of over 300,000 square feet of existing space in Rochester, NY.  This new multi-building Paychex campus, announced in August 2017, will result in the consolidation of current leased space in the Rochester area.

Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, reflects our acquisitions of Lessor in February 2018, our acquisition of HROI in August 2017, and our acquisition of Advance Partners in December 2015. The Lessor and Advance Partners acquisition consideration was cash while the HROI acquisition was a combination of cash and common stock.   

Purchases of other assets relates primarily to client list acquisitions. During fiscal 2018, we resolved a contractual dispute with certain licensees. As it relates to this agreement, we acquired rights to certain client lists for approximately $30.0 million.  

Financing Cash Flow Activities 

Net change in client fund obligations:    The client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds, and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. 

Client fund obligation balances are significantly impacted by the timing of the period end.  Fluctuations in the net change in client fund obligations for the years presented are primarily the result of timing of collections and remittances and overall trends in client fund balances.  May 31, 2018 fell on a Thursday, which is a significant collection day for direct pay funds.  These funds were then paid out on Friday June 1, 2018.  May 31, 2017 fell on a Wednesday compared to May 31, 2016 which was a Tuesday.  Payroll tax funds continued to be collected on Wednesday, May 31, 2017, yet the federal semi-weekly tax payment was delayed until Thursday, June 1, 2017 due to the Memorial Day holiday weekend.  As such, a higher client fund obligation existed on May 31, 2017 than May 31, 2016.  The timing of the Memorial Day holiday in May 2016 prompted many clients to remit their payrolls before the holiday weekend, resulting in lower direct deposit funds as of May 31, 2016.  In addition, May 31, 2016 was a Tuesday, a larger cash outflow day due to clearing of Readychex and tax payments. 

Dividends paid:    In April 2018 and July 2017, our Board increased our quarterly dividend to shareholders by 12% to $0.56 per share from $0.50 per share, and by 9% to $0.50 per share from $0.46 per share, respectively. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 79%, 81%, and 80% for fiscal years   2018  ,    2017  , and   2016  , respectively. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow, and is subject to the discretion of our Board. 

Repurchases of common shares:     In July 2016, our Board approved a program to repurchase up to $350.0 million of our common stock, authorized through May 31, 2019 (the  July 2016 Program ).  The purpose of the July 2016 Program is to manage common stock dilution.  During fiscal   2018  , we repurchased   2.5   million shares for a total of   $143.1   million  .  During fiscal   2017  , we repurchased   2.9   million shares for a total of   $166.2   million.    Of the shares repurchased during fiscal   2017  , $59.7 million was repurchased under a previously authorized common stock repurchase program.   During fiscal   2016  , we purchased   2.2   million shares for a total of   $107.9   million, all   under the previously authorized common stock repurchase program.  Shares repurchased were retired.     

Activity related to equity-based plans:    The decrease in cash flows related to stock-based awards for fiscal   2018   compared to fiscal   2017   and the increase for fiscal   2017   compared to fiscal   2016   were largely driven by changes in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.  Shares of common stock issued through the exercise of stock options were 0.6 million shares, 1.4 million shares, and 0.9 million shares for fiscal years   2018  ,    2017  , and   2016  , respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. 

Revenue recognition:    Service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Fees earned for funding of temporary staffing clients  payrolls via purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract.  The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

For certain of our service offerings, we receive advance payments for set-up fees from our clients. We defer revenue associated with these advance payments, recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected life of clients. 

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain direct pass-through costs billed and incurred, which primarily include payroll wages, payroll taxes, and certain benefit premiums.  Direct costs related to certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as operating expenses rather than as a reduction in service revenue. 

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities. 

PEO insurance reserves:    As part of the PEO service, we offer workers  compensation insurance and health insurance to client companies for the benefit of client employees.  Workers' compensation insurance is provided under a fully insured high deductible workers  compensation insurance policy with a national insurance carrier. Workers  compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. In establishing the PEO workers' compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims. 

With respect to our PEO health insurance, we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured fixed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier. Under the minimum premium insurance arrangement, our health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims liability charges in accordance with our service contract with the carrier. The claims liability charges include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. 

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, workers' compensation final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future.  We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends.

Goodwill and other intangible assets:    Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.  We perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter.  For fiscal 2018, it was determined that the Company has three reporting units. A qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units in fiscal 2018, to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value. The qualitative assessment considered various financial, macroeconomic, industry, and reporting unit specific qualitative factors. Based on the results of our testing, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2018, 2017, or 2016. Subsequent to the latest review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the Company s goodwill balance. 

We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:   Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. We have determined that there is no impairment of long-lived assets for the fiscal 2018, 2017, or 2016. 

Stock-based compensation costs:    All stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock options, are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. We estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility. Expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior.  We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change. 

The fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant.  For grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents, the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period. 

We estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified, with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures. 

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award. 

Refer to Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our stock-based compensation plans. 

Income taxes:    We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain stock-based awards. With the early-adoption of   Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, a  t the time of the exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of stock awards, we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  Previously, we accounted for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess of the tax benefit over the deferred tax asset as an increase to additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Tax Act enacted in December 2017 was the most comprehensive tax reform legislation approved in more than two decades and makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. federal corporate income taxation, including, but not limited to: (i) reducing the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% (a blended statutory tax rate of 29.2% for fiscal 2018); (ii) creating new or furthering limitations to the deductibility of officer compensation, interest, meals, entertainment, and other expenses; and (iii) changing from a worldwide to a territorial taxation system.  As a result of the Tax Act, we made a one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities and made a change in the Company s annual effective income tax rate applied to income before income taxes for the first six months of fiscal 2018. 

We maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in its consolidated financial statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements, we must conclude that tax positions will be more-likely-than-not to be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below the more-likely-than-not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of the more-likely-than-not standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position. Refer to Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions.

Ite    m 7A.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Market Risk Factors 

Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk:      Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. As a result of our investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer-term available-for-sale securities. We follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. A substantial portion of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of AA or higher, and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities. We invest predominately in municipal bonds   including general obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a U.S. government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds   along with U.S. government agency securities and corporate bonds. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We manage the available-for-sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three and three-quarters years. 

During fiscal   2018  , our primary short-term investment vehicles were VRDNs and bank demand deposit accounts. We have no exposure to high-risk or illiquid investments.  We have insignificant exposure to European investments. We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk. 

During fiscal   2018  , the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was   1.5%  , compared to   1.2%   and   1.1%   for fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , respectively. When interest rates are rising, the full impact of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short- and long-term interest rate changes. During a rising interest rate environment, earnings increase from our short-term investments, and over time increase earnings from our longer-term available-for-sale securities. Earnings from the available-for-sale securities, which as of   May 31, 2018   had an average duration of   3.1   years, would not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates.  

The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities that had stated maturities as of   May 31, 2018   are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties. 

VRDNs are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature. 

After almost seven years of no movement in the Federal Funds rate, the Federal Reserve has raised the rate by 25 basis points six times since December 2015.  As of   May 31, 2018  , the Federal Funds rate was in the range of   1.50% to 1.75%   as compared to   in the range of 0.75% to 1.00%   as of   May 31, 2017  , and in the range of 0.25% to 0.50% as of   May 31, 2016  .  On June 13, 2018, the Federal Funds rate was raised an additional 25 basis points to a range of 1.75% to 2.0%. 

Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

daily   interest   rate changes; 

seasonal variations in investment balances; 

actual   duration   of short-term and available-for-sale securities; 

the   proportion   of taxable and tax-exempt investments; 

30   

Table of Contents  

changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous;  and 

financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates. 

Subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points. Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to earnings from a 25-basis-point change in short-term interest rates would be approximately $3.0 million to $4.0 million, after taxes, for a twelve-month period. Such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the Federal Funds rate. 

Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) averaged approximately $  5.0   billion for fiscal   2018  . Our anticipated allocation is approximately 40% invested in short-term securities and VRDNs with an average duration of less than 30 days, and 60% invested in available-for-sale securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three and three-quarters years.  

The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale securities reflected a net unrealized loss of   $38.3   million as of   May 31, 2018  , compared with a net unrealized gain of   $32.0   million as of   May 31, 2017  .   Refer to Note G of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional disclosures on fair value measurements. 

During fiscal   2018  , the net unrealized gain or loss on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized gain of   $41.4   million to an unrealized loss of $  54.5   million. During fiscal   2017  , the net unrealized loss or gain on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized loss of $  30.5   million to an unrealized gain of $  69.5   million. The net unrealized loss on our investment portfolios was approximately $  33.0   million as of   July 18, 2018  . 

As of   May 31, 2018   and   2017  , we had   $3.1   billion and   $4.6   billion, respectively, invested in available-for-sale securities at fair value. The weighted-average yield-to-maturity was   1.9%   and   1.7%   as of   May 31, 2018   and   2017  , respectively. The weighted-average yield-to-maturity excludes available-for-sale securities tied to short-term interest rates such as the VRDNs. Assuming a hypothetical increase in longer-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of available-for-sale securities as of   May 31, 2018  , would be in the range of $20.0 million to $25.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value. This hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio s recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders  equity. These fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations, unless any declines in fair value were considered to be other-than-temporary and an impairment loss recognized. 

Credit risk:      We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. We believe that the investments we held as of   May 31, 2018   were not other-than-temporarily impaired. While   $2.2   billion of our available-for-sale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost, we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms, and that the unrealized losses of   $40.7   million were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns. A significant portion of these securities in an unrealized loss position as of   May 31, 2018   and   2017   held an AA rating or better. We do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity, and further believe that it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment. 

We have some credit risk exposure in connection with our purchase of accounts receivable as a means of providing payroll funding to clients in the temporary staffing industry.  This credit risk exposure is diversified amongst multiple client arrangements and all such arrangements are regularly reviewed for potential write-off.  No single client is material in respect to total accounts receivable, service revenue, or results of operations.

REPO    RT ON MANAGEMENT S ASSESSMENT OF 

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Management of Paychex, Inc. (the  Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  (2013). Based on our assessment, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018. 

The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, is appointed by the Company s Audit Committee. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018, and as a part of their integrated audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

RE    PORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Paychex, Inc. 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Paychex, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, of stockholders  equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the  consolidated financial statements ).  We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).   

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.   

Basis for Opinions 

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report on Management s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.   

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over   financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note A   Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies 

Description of business:    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company  or  Paychex ) is a leading provider of integrated human capital management ( HCM ) solutions for payroll, human resource ( HR ), retirement, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses in the United States ( U.S. ).   The Company also has operations in Europe.  

Paychex, a Delaware corporation formed in 1979  , reports as one segment.   Substantially all of the Company s revenue is generated within the U.S. The Company also generates revenue within Europe, which represented less than one percent of the Company's total revenue for each of the years ended May 31, 2018 ( fiscal 2018 ), 2017 ( fiscal 2017 ), and 2016 ( fiscal 2016 ). Long-lived assets in Europe   were   approximately 13%   of total long-lived assets of the Company as of   May 31, 2018 and were insignificant as of   May 31, 2017  . 

Total revenue is comprised of service revenue and interest on funds held for clients. Service revenue is comprised primarily of the fees earned on our portfolio of HCM services, which include payroll processing and complementary HR management and administration services. Payroll service revenue is earned primarily from payroll processing, payroll tax administration services, employee payment services, and other ancillary services. Payroll processing services include the calculation, preparation, and delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal accounting records and management reports; preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection and remittance of clients  payroll obligations. 

Our Human Resource Services ( HRS ) portfolio of services and products provide small- to medium-sized businesses with retirement services administration, insurance services, HR administration services, and other HR services and products. Our comprehensive HR outsourcing service is available through Paychex HR Solutions, an administrative services organization ( ASO ), and Paychex PEO, a professional employer organization ( PEO ). Both options offer businesses a combined package of services that includes payroll, employer compliance, HR and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and the on-site availability of a professionally trained HR services representative, among other services. These comprehensive bundles of services are designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their payroll and related benefits costs while providing a benefits package equal to that of larger companies. The PEO differs from the ASO in that Paychex serves as a co-employer of the clients  employees, offers health care coverage to PEO client employees, and assumes the risks and rewards of workers  compensation insurance and certain health insurance products. PEO services are sold through the Company s registered and licensed subsidiary, Paychex Business Solutions, LLC. Paychex HR Essentials is an ASO product that provides support to the Company s clients over the phone or online to help manage employee-related topics. 

In connection with the automated payroll tax administration services, the Company electronically collects payroll taxes from clients  bank accounts, typically on payday, prepares and files the applicable tax returns, and remits taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with some items extending to 90 days. The Company handles regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes, and is subject to cash penalties imposed by tax or regulatory agencies for late filings and late or under payment of taxes. With employee payment services, employers are offered the option of paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a check drawn on a Paychex account (Readychex     ), or a check drawn on the employer s account and electronically signed by Paychex. For the first three methods, Paychex electronically collects net payroll from the clients  bank accounts, typically one business day before payday, and provides payment to the employees on payday. Same Day Automated Clearing House ( ACH ) functionality is also available for clients using direct deposit.  

The Company earns fees for funding of temporary staffing agencies  payroll via purchasing of accounts receivable invoices.  The fees are deducted from the funding payment and revenue is recognized over an average collection period of   35 to 45 days. 

In addition to service fees paid by clients, the Company earns interest on funds held for clients that are collected before due dates and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. The funds held for clients and related client fund obligations are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as current assets and current liabilities, respectively. The amount of funds held for clients and related client fund obligations varies significantly during the year. 

Basis of presentation:    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Subsequent Events:    The Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and/or disclosure through the date of issuance of these financial   statements. On July 12, 2018, Paychex announced that its Board of Directors (the  Board ) declared a regularly quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share payable August 23, 2018 to shareholders of record August 1, 2018.   

Cash and cash equivalents:    Cash and cash equivalents consist of available cash, money market securities, and other investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at acquisition. 

Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts:    Accounts receivable balances are shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance for doubtful   accounts. These balances   include: 1) PEO receivables   primarily related to client wages and related tax withholdings since the last payroll processed,   2) trade receivables for services provided to clients and 3) purchased receivables related to payroll funding arrangements with clients in the temporary staffing industry. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. Accounts receivable are written off and charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company has exhausted all collection efforts without success. Refer to Note H for further discussion of the Company s accounts receivable activity and balances. 

Funds held for clients and corporate investments:    Marketable securities included in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist primarily of securities classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value obtained from an independent pricing service. The funds held for clients portfolio also includes cash and cash equivalents such as money market securities. Unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, are reported as other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined by specific identification of the cost basis of each security. On the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, realized gains and losses from the funds held for client portfolio and corporate investment portfolio are included in interest on funds held for clients and investment income, net, respectively. 

Concentrations:    Substantially all of the Company s deposited cash is maintained at large well-capitalized (as defined by their regulators) financial institutions. These deposits may exceed the amount of any insurance provided. All of the Company s deliverable securities, primarily municipal bond securities, are held in custody with certain of the aforementioned financial institutions, for which that institution bears the risk of custodial loss. Non-deliverable securities are primarily time deposits and money market funds. 

Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation:    Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of property and equipment using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are generally as follows: 

Category  

Depreciable life  

Buildings and improvements  

10 to 35 years or the remaining life, whichever is shorter  

Data processing equipment  

Three to four years  

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment  

Three to seven years  

Leasehold improvements  

10 years or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter  

Normal and recurring repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. The Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. 

Software development and enhancements:    Expenditures for software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, which are generally   three to five years.   Software developed as part of the Company's main processing platform is depreciated   over twelve years.    For software developed for internal use, certain costs are capitalized, including external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining the software, and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The carrying value of software and development costs is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.

Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization:      The Company had $814.0 million and $657.1 million of goodwill as of   May 31, 2018   and 2017, respectively. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there   has been a potential decline in the fair value of a reporting unit.  The Company performs its annual impairment testing in its fiscal fourth quarter. For fiscal 2018, it was determined that the Company has three reporting units.     A qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units in fiscal 2018, to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value. The qualitative assessment considered various financial, macroeconomic, industry, and reporting unit specific qualitative factors.   During fiscal 2017, a qualitative assessment was performed on the Company s Paychex Advance LLC ( Paychex Advance ) reporting unit, and for all other reporting units a quantitative analysis was performed. During fiscal 2016, a quantitative analysis was performed for the Company s European reporting unit, and for all other reporting units a qualitative analysis was performed. Based on the results of the Company s testing, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal years   2018  ,    2017, or 2016.   Subsequent to the latest review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the Company s goodwill balance. 

Intangible assets are comprised primarily of client list acquisitions and are reported net of accumulated amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Intangible assets are amortized over periods generally ranging   from three to twelve years.   Certain client lists use an accelerated method, while other intangible assets use the straight-line method of amortization. The Company tests intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:   Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company has determined that there was no impairment of long-lived assets for the fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016.  

Foreign Currency  :    The financial statements of the Company s foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars.   Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates.  Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period.  The resulting non-cash foreign currency translation adjustments, representing unrealized gains or losses, are included in consolidated stockholders  equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income.  The Company did not have any realized gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions during the fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016.  

Revenue recognition:    Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services as well as investment income earned on funds held for clients.  Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the service period. The Company s service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Fees earned for funding of payrolls for temporary staffing agency clients via the purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract. These fees are then recognized over the average collection period of 35 to 45     days. The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

For certain of the Company's service offerings, it receives advance payments for set-up fees from its clients.  The Company defers revenue associated with these advance payments, recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected life of its clients. 

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain direct pass-through costs billed and incurred, which primarily include payroll wages, payroll taxes, and certain benefit premiums.  Direct costs related to certain benefit plans where the Company retains risk are recognized as operating expenses rather than as a reduction in service revenue. Direct pass-through costs billed and incurred recognized as a reduction in service revenue were   $7.9 billion, $5.9 billion, and $5.1 billion for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016,   respectively.

Table of Contents  

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities. 

PEO insurance reserves:    As part of the PEO service, the Company offers workers  compensation insurance and health insurance to client companies for the benefit of client employees. Workers' compensation insurance is provided under a fully insured high deductible workers  compensation insurance policy with a national insurance carrier. Workers  compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. In establishing the PEO workers' compensation insurance reserves, the Company uses an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims. 

The Company s maximum   individual claims liability, excluding   HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (   HROI   )  , was $1.3 million under both its fiscal 2018 and 2017 workers' compensation insurance policy. HROI s maximum individual claims liability was $0.5 million under its fiscal 2018 workers  compensation insurance policy. As of May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2017, the Company had recorded current liabilities of $19.4 million and $18.0 million, respectively, and long-term liabilities of $31.2 million and $22.3 million, respectively, on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers  compensation insurance costs.  

With respect to the PEO health insurance, the Company offers various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured fixed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier. Under the minimum premium insurance arrangement, the Company's health benefits in  surance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims liability charges in accordance with its service contract with the carrier. The claims liability charges include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims.  The Company's maximum individual claims liability, excluding HROI, was $0.3 million under both its calendar 2018 and 2017 minimum premium insurance plan policies. HROI s maximum individual claims liability was $0.3 million under its minimum premium insurance plan policies ending June 30, 2018.  Amounts accrued related to the health insurance reserves were $25.4 million and $15.7 million as of May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2017,   respectively. These amounts are included in current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements.  Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly with workers' compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future.  The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated insurance reserves.  Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could be significant, reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends. 

Stock-based compensation costs:    All stock-based awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. Volatility is estimated based on a combination of historical volatility, using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life, and implied market volatility. Expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior.  The Company periodically reassesses its assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model.  The Company will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change. 

The fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant.  For grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents, the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period. 

The Company s policy is to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. The assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified, with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures. 

43   

Table of Contents  

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any material change in one or more of these assumptions could have an impact on the estimated fair value of a future award. 

Refer   to Note E for further discussion of the Company s stock-based compensation plans. 

Income taxes:    The Company accounts for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Tax Act ) was signed into law. Refer to Note K for further discussion on deferred taxes and the tax impacts of the Tax Act.   

The Company also maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in its consolidated financial statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements, the Company must conclude that tax positions will be more-likely-than-not to be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the amount the Company expects to realize after examination by taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below the more-likely-than-not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has been met when developing the provision   for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of the more-likely-than-not standard could materially impact the Company s results of operations or financial position. The Company s reserve for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, was $14.7 million as of May 31, 2018 and $39.2 million as of May 31, 2017. Refer to Note K for further discussion of the Company s reserve for uncertain tax positions. 

Use of estimates  :    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. 

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements:      In March 2018,   the Company early-adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2017-09,    Compensation   -   Stock Compensation   (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.    ASU No. 2017-09 provides guidance concerning which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The adoption of ASU 2017-09 did not have a   material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2018, the Company early-adopted ASU No. 2017-01,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.  ASU No. 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business to allow for the evaluation of whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets   or businesses. The adoption of ASU 2017-01 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements:      In June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2018-07,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  ASU No 2018-07 expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The guidance also specifies that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than an entity s adoption date of Topic 606. This guidance is applicable to the Company s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02,  Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.  ASU No. 2018-02 allows entities to reclassify certain stranded income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings resulting from the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017.  The guidance also requires additional financial statement disclosures to clarify the effects of adoption.  ASU No. 2018-02 should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period or periods in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from the Tax Act was recognized.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. This guidance is applicable to the Company s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08,      Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities  .     The amendments in ASU No. 2017-08 require that the premium on purchased callable debt securities be amortized to the earliest call date. The amendments do not, however, require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; instead, the discount continues to be amortized to maturity.  This guidance is effective for public companies for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, and is applicable to the Company s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04,  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairments.   ASU No. 2017-04 establishes a one-step process for testing goodwill for a decrease in value, requiring a goodwill impairment loss to be measured as the excess of the reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value.  The guidance eliminates the second step of the current two-step process that requires the impairment to be measured as the difference between the implied value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the goodwill s carrying amount.   ASU No. 2017-04 is effective for public entities for annual or interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual impairment tests after January 1, 2017.  This guidance is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning June 1, 2020, and is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash: A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force.

Additionally, amounts for restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are to be included with cash and cash equivalents if the cash flow statement includes a reconciliation of the total cash balances for a reporting period.  ASU No. 2016-18 is effective for public business entities for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.   This guidance is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning June 1, 2018, and is not anticipated to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements  .   

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.  ASU No. 2016-16 will require that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs instead of when the asset is sold.  ASU No. 2016-16 is effective for public business entities for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. This guidance is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning June 1, 2018, and is being evaluated to determine the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  ASU No. 2016-01 provides updated guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of certain financial assets and liabilities. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. This guidance is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning June 1, 2018, and is not anticipated to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   This guidance, as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic, outlines a single comprehensive model for determining revenue recognition for contracts with customers, and supersedes current guidance on revenue recognition in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.   ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods.    

The Company will adopt and begin reporting under the new standard in its fiscal year beginning June 1, 2018, using the full retrospective method.  As of the date of this report, the Company has finalized the analysis of the new standard and its impact to the Company. As anticipated, the primary impact of adopting the new standard is on the way the Company treats certain costs to obtain contracts and costs to fulfill contracts.  Generally, in relation to these items, the new standard will result in the Company deferring additional costs than those deferred under current U.S. GAAP on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently amortizing them to the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income over the estimated average life of the client. As the Company s revenue grows, the impact of deferring and amortizing additional costs creates higher overall pre-tax income, net earnings, and earnings per share, when compared to current U.S. GAAP. The Company has concluded that the provisions of the new standard will not have a material impact on the timing or the amount of revenue it recognizes on an annual basis in its Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  However, the Company has concluded that the provisions of the new standard will have a material impact on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The Company is nearly complete in determining the impacts of the disclosure requirements under the new standard, including the way it will disaggregate revenue into categories that show how economic factors affect the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows generated from contracts with customers.  The Company is in the process of assessing its accounting considerations to ensure its ability to record, report, and analyze results under the new standard. 

Other recent authoritative guidance issued by the FASB (including technical corrections to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) did not, or are not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

The purpose of the program is to manage common stock dilution.  All shares repurchased were retired.  

Note C   Business Combinations 

Effective February 28, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Lessor Group ( Lessor ). Upon closing, Lessor became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  Lessor is a market-leading provider of payroll and HCM software solutions headquartered in Denmark and serving clients in Northern Europe.  The Company believes that the acquisition will provide additional opportunities for growth in Europe.  The purchase price was $162.5 million, net of $13.4 million in cash acquired.  Goodwill in the amount of $111.5 million was recorded as a result of the acquisition, which is not tax-deductible.  The purchase accounting is provisional and subject to change, pending completion of a final valuation of Lessor.  However, further changes to goodwill resulting from the acquisition are not anticipated to be material to the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

Effective August 18, 2017, the   Company acquired HROI   and all of its operating subsidiaries.  HROI is a national PEO that provides HR solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses in more than 35 states.  The acquisition expands the Company s presence in the PEO industry.  The purchase price was $75.4 million and was comprised of $42.2 million of cash plus $33.2 million issued in the form of Paychex common stock.  Goodwill in the amount of $51.1 million was recorded as a result of the acquisition, which is not tax-deductible. 

Effective December 22, 2015, substantially all of the net assets of Advance Partners, a leading provider of integrated financial, operational, and strategic services to support independent staffing firms, were acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary of the   Company  .  Advance Partners offers customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services, which include payroll, invoicing, and tax preparation.  The acquisition consideration was comprised of a base purchase price of $190.5 million plus immediate settlement of debt totaling $118.4 million, net of $12.8 million in cash acquired. Accounts receivable balances acquired, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and less amounts due to clients related to funding arrangements, totaled $164.8 million. This acquisition allows the Company access to a growing industry serving small- to medium-sized businesses. Goodwill in the amount of $95.6 million was recorded as a result of the acquisition, which is tax-deductible. 

The financial results of Lessor, HROI, and Advance Partners are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.  The Company concluded that these acquisitions were not material to its results of operations and financial position.  Therefore, pro-forma financial information has been excluded.

Investment income, net, consisted of the following items: 

Note E   Stock-  Based   Compensation Plans 

The Paychex, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective on October 14, 2015 (the  2002 Plan ), authorizes grants of up to   44.1   million shares of the Company s common stock.  As of May 31, 2018, there were   19.4   million shares available for future grants under the 2002 Plan.  

47   

Table of Contents  

All stock-based awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant.  These costs are recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and an increase in additional paid-in capital. 

Stock-based compensation expense was   $44.6   million,   $35.4   million, and   $34.6   million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  Additional stock-based compensation expense was recognized in fiscal 2018 when the Company made a decision to maximize its tax benefit by accelerating the vesting of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) into fiscal 2018 that would have otherwise vested in August 2018. Related income tax benefits recognized were   $14.5   million,   $13.4   million, and   $12.9   million for the respective fiscal years.  Capitalized stock-based compensation costs related to the development of internal use software for these same fiscal years were not significant. 

As of May 31, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested stock-based awards was   $66.6   million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.8   years. 

Black-Scholes fair value assumptions:     The fair value of stock option grants and performance stock options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.  The weighted-average assumptions used for valuation under the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows: 

Risk-free interest rates are yields for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes maturing approximately at the end of the expected option life.  The estimated volatility factor is based on a combination of historical volatility, using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life, and implied market volatility.  The expected option life is based on historical exercise behavior. 

The Company has determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application, are appropriate in estimating the fair value of its stock option grants.  The Company periodically assesses its assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change. 

Stock options:    Stock options entitle the holder to purchase, at the end of the vesting term, a specified number of shares of Paychex common stock at an exercise price per share set equal to the closing market price of the common stock on the date of grant.  All stock options have a contractual life of   ten   years from the date of the grant and a vesting schedule as established by the Board.  The Company issues new shares of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises.  Non-qualified stock option grants to officers and outside directors are typically approved by the Board in July.  Prior to fiscal 2018, grants of non-qualified stock options to officers vested   one  -quarter per annum.  Beginning in fiscal 2018, grants of non-qualified stock options to officers vest   one  -third per annum.  Grants to members of the Board vest after   one   year.

Restricted stock units:     The Board grants RSUs to non-officer management.  An RSU is an agreement to issue shares at the time of vesting with no associated exercise cost for the employee.  For each unit granted, the holder will receive one share of stock at the time of vesting.  RSUs do not have voting rights or earn dividend equivalents during the vesting period.  These awards vest   one  -fifth per annum over   five   years.  The Company made a decision in fiscal 2018 to accelerate the vesting of the August 2018 tranche into fiscal 2018.  The fair value of RSUs is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.

Restricted stock awards:    The Board has approved grants of restricted stock awards to the Company s officers and outside directors.  All shares underlying awards of restricted stock are restricted in that they are not transferable until they vest.  The recipients of the restricted stock have voting rights and earn dividends, which are paid to the recipient at the time the awards vest. If the recipient leaves Paychex prior to the vesting date for any reason, the shares of restricted stock and the dividends accrued on those shares will be forfeited and returned to Paychex. 

Time-vested restricted stock awards granted to officers vest   one  -third per annum.  Restricted stock awards granted to outside directors vest on the   one  -year anniversary of the grant date.  The fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant and is expensed over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. 

The following table summarizes restricted stock activity for fiscal 2018: 

Other information pertaining to restricted stock is as follows: 

Performance shares:     Performance shares primarily have a   two  -year performance period, after which the amount of restricted shares earned will be determined based on achievement against established performance targets.  The restricted shares earned will then be subject to a   one  -  year service period.  Performance shares do not have voting rights or earn dividend equivalents during the performance period.  The fair value of performance shares is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends over the performance period.

Long-term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ):    The Company has two long-term incentive performance-based stock awards. In July 2011, the Board approved a special award of performance-based non-qualified stock options under an LTIP.  Subsequent grants of this award were made upon hire of new officers.  Under this award, stock options were granted to officers with vesting dependent on achievement against long-term strategic and financial objectives.  Total stock options earned and vested were based on achievement against pre-established targets for fiscal 2016.  The performance period was completed in fiscal 2016.  Although the performance period was completed and the stock options were earned and vested, there are still stock options outstanding as of May 31, 2018. 

In July 2016, the Board approved an LTIP award comprised of both performance-based non-qualified stock options and performance-based restricted stock.  This award was granted to senior executives down to the vice president level with vesting dependent on achievement against long-term strategic and financial objectives.  Total stock options and restricted shares to be earned are based on achievement against pre-established targets for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2020.

Non-compensatory employee benefit plan:    Prior to January 1, 2016, the Company offered a non-qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ) to all employees under which the Company s common stock could be purchased through a payroll deduction with no discount to the market price and no look-back provision.  This ESPP was discontinued as of December 31, 2015.  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company began offering a qualified ESPP to all employees.  Under this qualified ESPP, the Company s common stock can be purchased through a payroll deduction at a discount to the market price.  The qualified ESPP allows for a discount of up to   15%   based on the sole discretion of the committee established to administer the plan.  For offering periods during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016 the discount was set at   5%   of the market price.  Transactions under the non-qualified ESPP occurred directly through the Company s transfer agent and no brokerage fees were charged to employees, except for when stock was sold.  Transactions under the qualified ESPP occur through the Company s third-party stock plan administrator.  The plans have been deemed non-compensatory and therefore,   no   stock-based compensation costs have been recognized for fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016 related to either plan. 

Note F   Funds Held for Clients and Corporate Investments 

Funds held for clients and corporate investments are as follows:

Pre-refunded municipal bonds are secured by an escrow fund of U.S. government obligations.     

Included in money market securities and other cash equivalents as of May 31, 2018 were bank demand deposit accounts, time deposits, commercial paper, and money market funds.  Included in money market securities and other cash equivalents as of May 31, 2017 were bank demand deposit accounts and money market funds.   

Classification of investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows: 

The Company s available-for-sale securities reflected a net unrealized loss of   $38.3   million as of May 31, 2018, compared to a net unrealized gain of $32.0 million as of May 31, 2017.  Included in the net unrealized loss as of May 31, 2018 were 970 available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position. Included in the net unrealized gain as of May 31, 2017 were 216 available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position. The available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position were as follows:

Table of Contents  

The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns.  The Company believes that the investments held as of May 31, 2018 that had gross unrealized losses of $40.7 million were not other-than-temporarily impaired.  The Company believes that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with contractual terms, and that the unrealized losses on these securities were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns.  A majority of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2017 held an AA rating or better.  The Company does not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity, and further believes that it is not more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell these investments prior to that time.  The Company s assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in the Company s strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment. 

Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities were as follows: 

The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities that had stated maturities as of May 31, 2018 are shown below by contractual maturity.  Expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties. 

Variable rate demand notes are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years.  Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature.

Note G   Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting standards related to fair value measurements include a hierarchy for information and valuations used in measuring fair value that is broken down into three levels based on reliability, as follows: 

Level 1 valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the Company can access at the measurement date.     

Level 2 valuations are based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the instrument, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability including the following:     

o 

quoted prices for similar, but not identical, instruments in active markets;     

o 

quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active;     

o 

inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the instrument; or     

o 

inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.      

Level 3 valuations are based on information that is unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.     

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, accounts payable and short-term borrowings, when used by the Company, approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Marketable securities included in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist primarily of securities classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 

The Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: 

55   

Table of Contents  

In determining the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company predominately uses the market approach. Money market securities, which are cash equivalents, are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Commercial paper and time deposits, which are cash equivalents, are considered Level 2 investments as they are valued based on similar, but not identical, instruments in active markets. Available-for-sale securities, including municipal bonds, variable rate demand notes, corporate bonds, and U.S. government agency securities, are included in Level 2 and are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of the Company s Level 2 available-for-sale securities, the independent pricing service uses a variety of inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information. The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service because it believes that they are appropriately valued. 

Assets included as other are mutual fund investments, consisting of participants  eligible deferral contributions under the Company s non-qualified and unfunded deferred compensation plans. The related liability is reported as other long-term liabilities. The mutual funds are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. 

The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the Company s effective income tax rate is as follows: 

The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was significantly impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act.  In addition, the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were impacted by the recognition of a net discrete tax benefit related to employee stock-based compensation payments. 

The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to U.S. federal corporate income taxation including, but not limited to: (i) reducing the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to   21%   (a blended statutory tax rate of   29.2%   for fiscal 2018); (ii) repeal of the Section 199 qualified production activities deduction; (iii) creating new or furthering limitations to the deductibility of certain officer compensation, interest, meals, entertainment and other expenses; and (iv) changing from a worldwide to a territorial taxation system.  In December 2017, the staff of the SEC issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 118,  Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,  allowing taxpayers to record provisional amounts for reasonable estimates when they do not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete their accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act.  The SEC also issued rules that would allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the related tax impacts.  

As a result of the Tax Act, the Company derived estimated tax benefits of   $102.6   million, including a net tax benefit of   $25.5   million related to the revaluation of the Company s net deferred tax liabilities and a net tax benefit of   $77.1   million related to the reduction in the Company s statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2018 applied to income before taxes.  These amounts totaled   $0.07   per diluted share and   $0.21   per diluted share, respectively.  This analysis is complete except for provisional amounts that were determined in accordance with SAB No. 118 related to certain equity compensation arrangements.  Further Internal Revenue Service guidance related to whether these compensation arrangements meet the transition rule under the Tax Act is expected to be released within the next nine months and any change to the provisional amounts as a result of this further guidance is not anticipated to be material. 

During fiscal 2016, the Company engaged tax specialists to assess the qualification of its customer-facing computer software for the federal  Qualified Production Activities Deduction  under Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) Section 199, and the regulations thereunder.  Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that certain of its software offerings qualified for this tax deduction for fiscal 2016 and prior tax years that remained open to Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) examination.  The Company submitted claims to recover these tax benefits for prior tax years and claimed the fiscal 2016 tax benefits when it filed its 2016 tax return.  Accordingly, the Company recognized the tax benefits, and related tax reserves, for its qualified customer-facing activities for these years in fiscal 2016. 

Uncertain income tax positions:    The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, numerous local and state tax jurisdictions within the U.S., and taxes in Europe.  The Company maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions. As of May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2017, the total reserve for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, was   $14.7   million and   $39.2   million, respectively, and was included in long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In December 2016, the Company executed a closing agreement that resolved tax matters related to the audits by New York State for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2012 ( fiscal 2012 ) through the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014 ( fiscal 2014 ).  As a result, the reserve for uncertain tax positions was decreased by   $28.9   million in December 2016.  The resolution and execution of the closing agreement in December 2016 on the open tax matters for fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2014 had a minimal impact on the Company s effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017. 

In May 2018, the Company settled its IRS examination for fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017.  As a result of the settlement, the reserve for uncertain tax positions was decreased by   $27.2   million and income tax expense of   $2.7   million was recorded.   

The reserve as of May 31, 2018 substantially relates to the Company s uncertain tax positions for certain federal and state income tax matters.  The Company believes the reserve for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, of $14.7 million as of May 31, 2018 adequately covers open tax years and uncertain tax positions up to and including fiscal 2018 for major taxing jurisdictions. As of May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2017, the entire   $14.7   million and   $  39.2   million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and net of federal benefit, if recognized, would impact the Company s effective income tax rate.  

The Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2017. With limited exception, state income tax audits by taxing authorities are closed through fiscal 2014, primarily due to expiration of the statute of limitations. 

The Company continues to follow its policy of recognizing interest and penalties accrued on tax positions as a component of income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with the Company s tax positions is immaterial to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of interest and penalties recognized for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 was immaterial to the Company s results of operations.

The Paychex, Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan (the  Plan ) allows all employees to immediately participate in the salary deferral portion of the Plan, contributing up to a maximum of   50%   of their salary, subject to IR  S   limitations. Employees who have completed   one   year of service and a minimum of   1,000   hours worked are eligible to receive a Company matching contribution, when such contribution is in effect.  The Company provided a matching contribution of   50%   of up to   8%   of eligible pay that an employee contributed to the Plan through March 29, 2018.    Beginning March 30, 2018, the Company provides a matching contribution of   100%   of the first   3%   and   50%   on the next   2%   of eligible pay for a total matching contribution of   4%  .    Company contributions to the Plan for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 were   $23.6   million,   $22.4   million, and   $21.4   million, respectively.  

The Plan is   100%   participant directed. Plan participants can fully diversify their portfolios by choosing from any or all investment fund choices in the Plan. Transfers in and out of investment funds, including the Paychex, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan Stock Fund, are not restricted, with the exception of certain restricted trading periods for individuals designated as insiders as specified in the Company s Insider Trading Policy. The Company match contribution, when in effect, follows the same fund elections as the employee compensation deferrals. 

Deferred compensation plans:    The Company offers non-qualified and unfunded deferred compensation plans to a select group of key employees, executive officers, and outside directors. Eligible employees are provided with the opportunity to defer up to   50%   of their annual base salary and bonus and outside directors may defer   100%   of their Board cash compensation. Gains and losses are credited based on the participant s election of a variety of investment choices. The Company does not match any participant deferral or guarantee its return. Distributions are paid at one of the following dates selected by the participant: the participant s termination date, the date the participant retires from any active employment, or a designated specific date.  The amounts accrued under these plans were   $18.2   million and   $16.7   million as of May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2017, respectively, and are reflected in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Contingencies:     The Company is subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of its business. These include disputes or potential disputes related to breach of contract, tort, patent, breach of fiduciary duty, employment-related claims, tax claims, and other matters. 

The Company s management currently believes that resolution of outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position and the results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

The Company s estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and are not material as of the reporting date.
