  Item 1.  Business 
  Overview 
  Fiserv, Inc. is a leading global provider of financial services technology. We are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and part of the S P 500 Index. We serve over   12,000   clients worldwide, including banks, savings banks, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, billers, retailers, merchants, and building societies. We provide account processing systems; electronic payments processing products and services, such as electronic bill payment and presentment services, card-based transaction processing and network services, ACH transaction processing, account-to-account transfers, and person-to-person payments; internet and mobile banking systems; and related services including document and payment card production and distribution, check processing and imaging, source capture systems, and lending and risk management products and services. Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. Our operations are principally located in the United States where we operate data and transaction processing centers, provide technology support, develop software and payment solutions, and offer consulting services. 
  In   2017  , we had   $5.7 billion   in total revenue,   $1.5 billion   in operating income and   $1.5 billion   of net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations. Processing and services revenue, which in   2017   represented   85%   of our total revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of   three to five   years and high renewal rates. Revenue from clients outside the United States comprised approximately   5%   of total revenue in each of   2017   and   2016   and   6%   in   2015  . 
  We have grown our business by developing highly specialized product and service enhancements, extending our capabilities through innovation, welcoming new clients, selling additional products and services to existing clients, and acquiring businesses that complement ours, all of which have enabled us to deliver a wide range of integrated products and services and have created new opportunities for growth. 
  We originally incorporated in Delaware in 1984 and reincorporated as a Wisconsin corporation in 1992. Our headquarters are located at 255 Fiserv Drive, Brookfield, Wisconsin 53045, and our telephone number is (262) 879-5000. 
  Our operations are reported in the Payments and Industry Products ( Payments ) and Financial Institution Services ( Financial ) business segments. Financial information regarding our business segments is included in Note   9     to the consolidated financial statements.

Payments 
  The businesses in our Payments segment provide financial institutions and other companies with the products and services required to process electronic payment transactions and to offer their customers access to financial services and transaction capability through digital channels. Financial institutions and other companies have increasingly relied on third-party providers for those products and services, either on a licensed software or outsourced basis, as an increasing number of payment transactions are completed electronically as our clients  customers seek the convenience of 24-hour digital access to their financial accounts. Within the Payments segment, we primarily provide electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, account-to-account transfers, person-to-person payment services, debit and credit card processing and services, payments infrastructure services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. Our solutions in the Payments segment include:

More than 2,500 financial institutions have agreed to offer our person-to-person payments services to their customers as of December 31,   2017  . In addition to Popmoney, we partner with Early Warning Services, LLC to offer a turnkey implementation of its Zelle        real-time person-to-person payments service. Our turnkey solution simplifies the implementation of Zelle by providing interface, risk management, alerting, settlement and other services to clients.

  In the third quarter of 2017, we completed the acquisition of Monitise plc, a provider of digital solutions, including FINkit, that enables innovative digital banking experiences for leading financial institutions worldwide. 
  Card Services 
  Our card services business is a leader in electronic funds transfer and provides a total payments solution through a variety of products and services. We provide thousands of financial institution clients with a full range of credit and debit processing services, including: ATM monitoring, tokenization, loyalty and reward programs, real-time person-to-person payments, customized authorization processing, direct access and settlement for networks, and risk management solutions. We own and operate the Accel        network, which serves more than 3,000 financial institutions with funds access at over 500,000 ATMs and incorporates CardFree Cash   SM    access as well as EMV        chip and traditional magnetic stripe cards.

Biller Solutions 
  Our biller business provides electronic billing and payment services to companies that deliver bills to their customer base, such as utilities, telephone and cable companies, consumer lending institutions, and insurance providers, enabling our biller clients to reduce costs, collect payments faster through multiple channels, increase customer satisfaction, and provide customers flexible, easy-to-use ways to view and pay their bills. Our clients  customers access our electronic billing and payment systems by viewing or paying a bill through a financial institution s bill payment application, using a biller s website, mobile application or automated phone system, leveraging www.mycheckfree.com, or by paying in person at one of more than 24,000 nationwide walk-in payment locations. These diverse options allow our clients  customers to view and pay bills wherever, whenever and however they feel most comfortable. Furthermore, because our biller clients are able to receive all of these services from us, we can eliminate the operational complexity and expense of supporting multiple vendor systems or in-house developed systems. 
  Output Solutions 
  Our output solutions business provides business communication solutions to clients across a wide variety of industries, including financial services, healthcare, retail, utilities, and travel and entertainment. Our products and services include: electronic document management through our electronic document delivery products and services; card manufacturing, personalization and mailing; statement production and mailing; design and fulfillment of direct mail solutions; forms distribution; laser printing and mailing; branded merchandise; and office supplies. 
  Investment Services 
  Our investment services business provides technology solutions that enable financial planning, portfolio management and trading, model management, performance measurement, and reporting products and services to financial service organizations, including broker dealers, registered investment advisors, banks, asset managers and insurance companies that deliver financial advice and managed account products to U.S. retail investors.

  Financial 
  The businesses in our Financial segment provide financial institutions with the products and services they need to run their operations. By licensing software from third parties or outsourcing their processing requirements by contracting with third-party processors, financial institutions are typically able to reduce costs and enhance their products, services, capacity and capabilities. For example, the licensing of software reduces the need for costly technical expertise within a financial institution, and outsourcing processing operations reduces the infrastructure and other costs required to operate systems internally. Within the Financial segment, we provide depository institutions and leasing and finance companies with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Many of the products and services that we sell are integrated with solutions from our Payments segment such as electronic bill payment and presentment, internet and mobile banking, debit processing and network services, and person-to-person payments. Our solutions in the Financial segment include:

Account Processing 
  We provide account servicing and management technology solutions to our depository institution clients, as well as a range of integrated, value-added banking products and services. Account processing solutions are the principal systems that enable a financial institution to operate systems that process customer deposit and loan accounts, an institution s general ledger, central information files and other financial information. These solutions also include extensive security, report generation and other features that financial institutions need to process transactions for their customers, as well as to comply with applicable regulations. Although many of our clients contract to obtain a majority of their processing requirements from us, our software design allows clients to start with one application and, as needed, add applications and features developed by us or by third parties. We support a broad range of client-owned peripheral devices manufactured by a variety of vendors, which reduces a new client s initial conversion expenses, enhances existing clients  ability to change technology and broadens our market opportunity. 
  The principal account processing solutions used by our bank clients are Cleartouch       , DNA       , Precision       , Premier       , Signature        and TotalPlus       .

Consistent with this focus, we continue to operate our business in accordance with the following strategic framework:

     Table of Contents  

Portfolio Management  . We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies. 
                
    Client Relationship Value  . We plan to increase the number and breadth of our client relationships by, among other actions: continuing to integrate our products and services; introducing new products and services that are aligned with market needs; combining products and services to deliver enhanced, integrated value propositions; and improving the quality of our client service and support. 
                
    Operational Effectiveness  . We believe we can improve the quality of our client delivery while reducing our costs by using the opportunities created by our size and scale. For example, we are using our consolidated buying power and optimizing our facilities to create cost savings. 
                
    Capital Discipline  . We intend to make capital allocation decisions that offer the best prospects for our long-term growth and profitability, which may include, among other matters, internal investment, repayment of debt, repurchases of our own shares or acquisitions. 
                
    Innovation  . We seek to be an innovation leader, utilizing our assets and capabilities to be at the forefront of our industry and enable our clients to deliver best-in-class results. 
     Servicing the Market 
  The markets for our account and transaction processing services have specific needs and requirements, with strong emphasis placed by clients on quality, security, integration with other product lines, service reliability, timely introduction of new products and features, flexibility and value. We believe that our financial strength and primary focus on the financial services industry enhances our ability to meet these needs and service our clients. In addition, we believe that our dedication to providing excellent client service and support no matter the size of the client and our commitment of substantial resources to training and technical support helps us to identify and fulfill the needs of our clients. 
  Product Development 
  To meet the changing technology needs of our clients, we continually develop, maintain and enhance our products and systems. Product development expenditures represented approximately   8%   of our total revenue in each of   2017   and   2016   and   9%   in   2015  . Our development and technology centers apply the expertise of multiple teams to design, develop and maintain specialized processing systems. Our account processing systems are designed to meet the preferences and diverse requirements of the international, national, regional or local market-specific financial service environments of our clients. In developing our products, we use current software development principles, such as service-oriented architecture, to create efficiencies, and we stress interaction with and responsiveness to the needs of our clients. 
  Intellectual Property 
  We regard our software, transaction processing services and related products as proprietary, and we utilize a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, internal security practices, and employee and third party non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property assets. Our patents cover innovations relating to numerous financial software products and services, and we continue, where appropriate, to seek and secure patents with respect to our ongoing innovations. We believe that we possess all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business. 
  Competition 
  The market for technology products and services in the financial industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology, data processing affiliates of large companies, and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives. Outside the U.S., our primary competitors include global and local IT product and services companies, as well as payment service providers and processors. We expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services. Some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do and have substantial flexibility in competing with us, including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing. Competitive factors for our business include product quality, security, integration with other product lines, service reliability, timely introduction of new products and features, flexibility and value. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. Additional information about competition in our segments is provided below.

Payments 
  The businesses in our Payments segment compete with a number of competitors, including ACI Worldwide, Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. ( FIS ), First Data Corporation, Jack Henry and Associates Inc. ( Jack Henry ), KUBRA Data Transfer, Ltd., MasterCard Incorporated, NCR Corporation, Paymentech, LLC, Paymentus Corporation, PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q2 Holdings, Inc., R.R. Donnelley   Sons Company, Total System Services, Inc., U.S. Bancorp, Visa Inc., The Western Union Company and Worldpay, Inc. In addition to traditional payments competitors, large technology, media and other providers are increasingly seeking to provide or facilitate a wide range of point of sale and non-point of sale payments. These newer competitors include, but are not limited to, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook, Inc., Intuit Inc., Samsung Group, Starbucks Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Existing and potential financial institution and biller clients, could also develop and use their own in-house systems instead of our products and services. In addition, many companies that provide solutions to the financial services industry are consolidating, creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines. 
  Financial 
  Our products and services in the Financial segment compete in several different market segments and geographies, including with large, diversified software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products. Existing and potential financial institution clients could also develop and use their own in-house systems. In addition, we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions, including Black Knight Financial Technology Solutions LLC, Computer Services, Inc., Finastra Limited, FIS, Infosys Ltd., International Business Machines Corporation, Jack Henry, Oracle Corporation, SAP SE and Temenos Group AG. 
  Government Regulation 
  The regulations that apply to the delivery of financial services are complex and evolve continuously. Except with respect to certain products and services, Fiserv and its subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations applicable to financial institutions such as banks and credit unions. However, as a provider of services to these financial institutions, our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities and representatives of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. Also, state and federal regulations may require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us, such as those related to security and privacy, and to conduct ongoing monitoring and risk management for third party relationships. In addition, independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients and their auditors. 
  In conducting our direct-to-consumer businesses, including our walk-in bill payment, online bill payment and Popmoney person-to-person payment services, we are directly subject to various federal and state laws, rules and regulations including those relating to the movement of money. In order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws, we are required, among other matters, to comply with licensing and reporting requirements, to implement operating policies and procedures necessary to comply with anti-money laundering laws, to comply with capital requirements, to protect the privacy and security of our clients  information, and to undergo periodic audits and examinations. 
  Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd-Frank Act ), there have been substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry, including numerous new regulations that have imposed compliance costs and, in some cases, limited revenue sources for us and our clients. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), which is empowered to conduct rule-making and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has issued guidance that applies to, and conducts direct examinations of,  supervised banks and nonbanks  as well as  supervised service providers  like us. In addition, federal and state agencies have begun to propose and enact cybersecurity regulations, such as the Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services in 2017 and the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Enhanced Cyber Risk Management Standards proposed by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 2016. New regulations could, among other things, require us to make significant additional investments to comply with them, modify our products or services or the manner in which they are provided, or limit or change the amount or types of revenue we are able to generate.

Employees 
  We have nearly 24,000 employees globally, many of whom are specialists in our information management centers and related product and service businesses. This service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial industry, as well as employees with direct experience in payments, financial institutions and other financial services environments. Our employees provide expertise in: programming, software development, modification and maintenance; computer operations, network control and technical support; client services and training; business process outsourcing; item and mortgage processing; system conversions; sales and marketing; and account management. 
  The service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset. Although the market for qualified personnel is competitive, we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining our staff of top industry professionals. In assessing a potential acquisition candidate, we emphasize the quality and stability of the acquisition candidate s employees. 
  Available Information

  Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
  You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
  We operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively. 
  The markets for our services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors. Our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology, data processing affiliates of large companies, and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. Many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications in-house. As a result, we often compete against our existing or potential clients  in-house capabilities. We expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new well-funded competitors and new technologies, including large technology, media and other companies not historically in the financial services industry, start-ups and international providers of similar products and services to ours. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  If we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful, we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients, and our ability to grow may be limited. 
  The markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services, and increasing client expectations. Our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success. We may not be successful in developing, marketing or selling new products and services that meet these demands or achieve market acceptance. In addition, the success of certain of our products and services rely, in part, on financial institutions, billers and other third parties to promote the use of our products and services by their customers. If we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance, or if third parties insufficiently promote our products and services, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients, to attract new ones and to grow profitably. 
  If we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms, we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
  Failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business. Our contracts with clients generally run for a period of three to five years. At the end of the contract term, clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services. If we are  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 
  Consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients. 
  Mergers, consolidations and failures of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients, which could adversely affect our revenue. If our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. It is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Security breaches, computer malware or other  cyber attacks  could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation. 
  Our operations depend on receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, our associates, our clients and their customers. Any unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service or similar act could disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems or data, or the systems or data of our clients or vendors. These events could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, increased regulatory scrutiny, financial sanctions and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients and cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, as these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. Although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us, we may not be able to prevent a material event in the future, and the impact of a material event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Operational failures could harm our business and reputation. 
  An operational failure could harm our business or cause us to lose clients. An operational failure could be caused by our actions or the actions of third parties, and could involve networks and systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and over which we have limited or no control. Interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses, including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities. A prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue. In addition, a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  We may experience software defects, development delays or installation difficulties, which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability. 
  Our services are based on sophisticated software and computer systems, and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services. Further, the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition, we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems used by our clients. Defects in our software, errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations, delay in market acceptance, additional development and remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of clients, negative publicity or exposure to liability claims. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements, we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability. 
  A heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business. 
  Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd-Frank Act ), a number of substantial regulations affecting the supervision and operation of the financial services industry within the United States have been adopted, including those that establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). The CFPB has issued guidance that applies to, and conducts direct examinations of,  supervised banks and nonbanks  as well as  supervised service providers  like us. In addition, federal and state governments have adopted or are pursuing numerous additional regulations impacting the financial services industry, including regulations related to cybersecurity and data privacy. To the extent this oversight or regulation negatively impacts the business, operations or financial condition of our clients, our business and results  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

of operations could be materially and adversely affected because, among other matters, our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us, could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business, or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions. Additional regulation, examination and oversight of us could require us to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our clients; directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services; require us to invest additional time and resources to comply with such oversight and regulations; or limit our ability to update our existing products and services, or require us to develop new ones. Any of these events, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, our businesses could be harmed. 
  If we fail to comply with regulations applicable to our business, including data privacy regulations, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings, our client relationships and reputation could be harmed, and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level, or, with respect to our international operations, in foreign jurisdictions on the national, provincial, state or other level, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability. 
  Certain of our subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters in those states where such licensure is required. In connection with such licensure, we are required to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports. In addition, our direct-to-consumer payments businesses, including our walk-in bill payment, online bill payment and Popmoney person-to-person payment services, are subject to federal regulation in the United States, including anti-money laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities. The complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business. In addition, any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers, or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions. 
  If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks, they could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations which could adversely affect our business. 
  We are subject to card association and network rules governing Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover or other similar organizations, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard enforced by the major card brands. The rules of the card networks are set by their boards which may be influenced by card issuers, some of which offer competing transaction processing services. If we fail to comply with these rules, we could be fined, our certifications could be suspended, or our certifications could be terminated. The suspension or termination of our certifications, or any changes to the card association and network rules, that we do not successfully address could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation, which, in either case, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
  We may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others. 
  Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims. If the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are, or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is, infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or services, and such changes may be expensive or impractical, or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights. If we are unable to agree on acceptable terms, we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations. We may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights, and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them. Any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit, they may result in costly and time-consuming litigation and may require significant attention from our management and key personnel. 
  Misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position. 
  Our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology. We actively seek to protect our proprietary rights. Nevertheless, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology. Agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy. Effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available.

Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Acquisitions subject us to risks, including increased debt, assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations. 
  A major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses. We anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses, products and services. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions in the future, which could adversely affect our future growth; or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may not be able to integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or realize the potential benefits of bringing them together. In addition, the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources. 
  These risks may arise for a number of reasons: we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms; we may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers; we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us; changes in accounting, tax, securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions; we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions; we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business; we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition; we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience; and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of non-cash impairment charges. 
  We may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements. 
  We have in the past and may in the future sell businesses. In connection with sales of businesses, we may make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale. Our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  The failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
  We depend on the experience, skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees. If we fail to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified management, technical, compliance and sales personnel, our future success could be harmed. Our senior management provides strategic direction for our company, and if we lose members of our leadership team, our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss. Our products and services require sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry, applicable regulatory and industry requirements, computer systems, and software applications, and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel, we could suffer delays in new product development, experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients  demands. 
  Our business may be adversely impacted by U.S. and global market and economic conditions. 
  For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry. Given this concentration, we are exposed to the global economic conditions in the financial services industry. A prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  The market for our electronic transaction services continues to evolve and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability. 
  If the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow, or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by a combination of factors including speed, cost, ease-of-use, security and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses.

New guidance or further analysis of the newly enacted U.S. tax reform legislation could cause us to modify current estimates about the impact that it will have on us, which could negatively impact our anticipated earnings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. 
  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Tax Act ). The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax code by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial-style tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. With the enactment of the Tax Act, our financial results for 2017 included a reduction of income tax expense of approximately   $275 million   resulting primarily from the re-evaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the recently enacted   21 percent   U.S. federal corporate tax rate and the deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings. These estimates are based on our initial analysis of the Tax Act. Further analysis of this complex legislation or future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board could cause us to adjust current estimates in future periods, which could impact our earnings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.   
  Our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations. 
  Our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent   73%   of our total assets at   December 31, 2017  . These assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill. In addition, we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired, then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations. 
  Increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations. 
  As of   December 31, 2017  , we had approximately   $4.9 billion   of debt. We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness could: decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes; limit our flexibility to make acquisitions; increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, if our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade, we may incur additional interest expense. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements, we may be required, among other things: to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets; to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms. 
   
  Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments 
  None. 
   
  Item 2.  Properties 
  As of   December 31, 2017  , we operated data, development, item processing and support centers in approximately 105 cities. We owned five buildings, and the more than 120 remaining locations where we operated our businesses are subject to leases. We believe that the facilities and equipment that we own and lease are well maintained, are in good operating condition, and are adequate for our business needs. However, we may choose to combine existing operations to enhance business integration. We maintain our own, and contract with multiple service providers to provide, processing back-up in the event of a disaster. We also maintain copies of data and software used in our business in locations that are separate from our facilities. 
   
  Item 3.  Legal Proceedings 
  In the normal course of business, we or our subsidiaries are named as defendants in lawsuits in which claims are asserted against us. In the opinion of management, the liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from such lawsuits are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Overview                     
  Company Background 
  We are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve over   12,000   clients worldwide, including banks, savings banks, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, billers, retailers, merchants, and building societies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of   three to five   years and high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. 
  Our operations are principally located in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products ( Payments ) segment and the Financial Institution Services ( Financial ) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, account-to-account transfers, person-to-person payment services, debit and credit card processing and services, payments infrastructure services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, credit unions, and leasing and finance companies with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Corporate and Other primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses including share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance. 
  Acquisitions and Dispositions 
  We frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of businesses to execute on our strategy. We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies. 
  During 2017, we completed four acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of   $384 million  , net of   $33 million   of acquired cash, along with earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of   $15 million  . In January 2017, we completed our acquisition of Online Banking Solutions, Inc. ( OBS ), a provider of cash management and digital business banking solutions that complement and enrich our existing solutions. In July 2017, we acquired the assets of PCLender, LLC ( PCLender ), a leader in internet-based mortgage software and mortgage lending technology solutions. The OBS and PCLender acquisitions are included in the Financial segment as their products are integrated across a number of our account processing solutions and will enable our bank and credit union clients to better serve their commercial and mortgage customers. In August 2017, we acquired Dovetail Group Limited ( Dovetail ), a leading provider of bank payments and liquidity management solutions. In September 2017, we completed our acquisition of Monitise plc ( Monitise ), a provider of digital solutions that enables innovative digital banking experiences for leading financial institutions worldwide. The Dovetail and Monitise acquisitions are included in the Payments segment and will further enable us to help financial institutions around the world transform their payments infrastructure and to expand our digital leadership, respectively.  
  In 2016, we acquired the Convenience Pay Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and completed our purchase of the Community Financial Services business of ACI Worldwide, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of   $265 million  . These acquisitions expand our biller solution offerings and enhance our suite of digital banking and payments solutions, and are included in the Payments segment. 
  In May 2017, we sold our Australian item processing business, which was reported within the Financial segment, for approximately   $17 million  , and, in January 2018, we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of Monitise for proceeds of    37 million   (  $50 million  ). In addition, in February 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell a 55% interest of our lending solutions business, which is reported within the Financial segment, retaining a 45% interest in the joint venture. 
  During 2017 and 2015, StoneRiver Group, L.P. ( StoneRiver ), a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2016, recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest. Our pre-tax share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was   $26 million   in   2017  ,   $146 million   in   2016   and   $29 million   in   2015  , with related tax expenses of   $9 million  ,   $54 million   and   $13 million  , respectively. In addition, we received cash dividends of   $45 million  ,   $151 million   and   $36 million   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, from StoneRiver, which were funded from the sale transactions.

Enterprise Priorities 
  We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for   2018   are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. 
  Industry Trends 
  The market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. The traditional financial industry and other market entrants regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, lending, investment and risk management products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, regulatory conditions and cybersecurity scrutiny have continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. For example, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and may continue to generate, new regulations impacting the financial industry. These conditions, along with mild economic improvement, have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as  digital channels.  
  This increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. Based on these market conditions, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. Furthermore, we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients. 
  In addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. An acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system, or elects to move to one of our systems, and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected. Financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts, which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. These fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. Our revenue is diversified, and our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model, and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25% of our annual revenue. In addition, we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. 
  Acquisitions 
  From time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. 
  Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets 
  We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test. 
  The quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future economic and market conditions.  
  Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of   2017   determined that our goodwill was not impaired. The estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values, except for recently acquired reporting units that approximated or exceeded the carrying values to a lesser magnitude given the short passage of time between the recent acquisition dates and when we performed our most recent annual impairment assessment. 
  We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally   three to five   years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. At times, however, judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition, such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables. Due to the quantity, size and nature of our multiple element arrangements, the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element. Additionally, given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations 
  Components of Revenue and Expenses 
  The following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. 
  Processing and Services 
  Processing and services revenue, which in   2017   represented   85%   of our total revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of   three to five   years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. 
  Product 
  Product revenue, which in   2017   represented   15%   of our total revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales which represented less than   4%   of our total revenue. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.

     Total Revenue 
  Total revenue   increased     $191 million  , or   3%  , in   2017   and   increased     $251 million  , or   5%  , in   2016   compared to the prior years. The increase in total revenue during   2017   and   2016   was attributable to revenue growth in our Payments segment of   5%   and   8%  , respectively, and revenue growth in our Financial segment of    2%   and   1%  , respectively, compared to the prior years.  
  Revenue in our Payments segment   increased     $144 million  , or   5%  , in   2017   and   increased     $228 million  , or   8%  , in   2016   compared to the prior years. Revenue growth at our card services business contributed approximately 2.5% in each of 2017 and 2016 to the Payments segment revenue growth largely due to increased transaction volumes. Increased volumes also drove revenue growth contributions of 1% in 2017 from our electronic payments business and 2% in 2016 from our output solutions business, which included a higher level of EMV chip card manufacturing and personalization, compared to the prior years. Revenue from in-year business acquisitions further contributed $22 million, or 1%, and $86 million, or 3%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, to Payments segment revenue growth. 
  Revenue in our Financial segment   increased     $53 million  , or   2%  , in   2017   and   increased     $34 million  , or   1%  , in   2016   compared to the prior years. Our lending solutions business contributed approximately 2% and 1% to the Financial segment revenue growth in 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by increased volumes. In addition, our account processing business contributed approximately 1% to the Financial segment revenue growth in 2016. Financial segment revenue growth was partially offset by the Australian item processing business disposition in 2017 and lower revenue in our international business in 2016, which each negatively impacted Financial segment revenue growth by approximately 1% compared to the prior years.

Total Expenses 
  Total expenses   increased     $104 million   in   2017   and   $117 million   in   2016  , or   3%   in each year, compared to the prior years. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was   73.1%  ,   73.8%   and   75.1%   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Total expenses were favorably impacted by 20 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the gain on the sale of our Australian item processing business.  
  Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was   47.4%  ,   47.8%   and   49.4%    in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2017 and 2016 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue in 2016 was also favorably impacted by approximately 80 basis points from lower amortization related to certain fully amortized acquisition-related intangible assets compared to the prior year. 
  Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was consistent in   2017   and   2016   at   84.9%  , and decreased from   86.7%   in   2015  . Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was negatively impacted in 2015 by increased expenses in our output solutions business associated with additional investments to expand our card manufacturing and personalization capacity.  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was   20.2%  ,   20.0%   and   19.7%   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to increased costs associated with acquisitions. 
  Operating Income and Operating Margin 
  Total operating income   increased     $87 million  , or   6%  , in   2017   and   increased     $134 million  , or   10%  , in   2016   compared to the prior years. Total operating margin   increased   to   26.9%   in   2017   from   26.2%   in   2016   and   24.9%   in   2015  .  
  Operating income in our Payments segment   increased     $91 million  , or   10%  , in   2017   and   increased     $103 million  , or   12%  , in   2016   compared to the prior years. Operating margin was   32.0%  ,   30.5%   and   29.3%   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, increasing   150   basis points in   2017   and   120   basis points in   2016  . Our card services business contributed approximately 110 basis points in each of 2017 and 2016 to the Payments segment operating margin growth largely attributable to scalable revenue growth. In addition, Payments segment operating margin was positively impacted by approximately 90 basis points from our electronic payments business in 2017 and by approximately 70 basis points from our output solutions business in 2016, attributable to improved operating leverage and product mix, respectively. Payments segment operating margin improvement was partially offset by approximately 50 basis points in each of 2017 and 2016 as a result of in-year acquisitions. 
  Operating income in our Financial segment   increased     $26 million  , or   3%  , in   2017   and was generally consistent in   2016   compared to the prior years. Operating margin was   33.5%  ,   33.2%   and   33.8%   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, increasing   30   basis points in   2017   and decreasing   60   basis points in   2016  . Financial segment operating margin in 2017 was positively impacted by approximately 70 basis points from scalable revenue growth. Increased expenses associated with incremental investments in innovation-based solutions negatively impacted Financial operating margin by 30 basis points and 60 basis points in 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
  The operating loss in Corporate and Other   increased     $30 million   in   2017   and   decreased     $34 million   in   2016   compared to the prior years. The operating loss increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to increased acquisition and related integration costs of $12 million and increased employee benefit expenses, including severance, of $20 million. These increased costs were partially offset by a $10 million gain on the sale of our Australian item processing business. The operating loss improvement in 2016 was primarily due to lower amortization related to certain fully amortized acquisition-related intangible assets compared to 2015. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense   increased     $13 million  , or   8%  , in   2017   and   decreased     $7 million  , or   4%  , in   2016   compared to the prior years. Higher average variable interest rates and higher average outstanding debt contributed approximately $7 million and $6 million, respectively, to increased interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016. The lower interest expense in 2016 was primarily due to the reclassification of $7 million to interest expense for unamortized losses on settled cash flow hedges related to the early extinguishment of debt in 2015. 
  Interest and Investment Income (Loss), net  
    
  The net interest and investment loss in 2016 was attributable to a non-cash write-off of a $7 million cost-method investment.

Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment 
  In May 2015, we redeemed our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in 2016 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.8% senior notes due in 2017, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $85 million related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with redemption.

  Income tax provision as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate was   11.6%  ,   38.6%   and   35.7%   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The rate in 2017 decreased by   20.3%   attributable to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as further described below, and by   3.6%   attributable to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards recognized as a reduction in the income tax provision as a result of the 2017 adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The higher rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the level of income tax expense associated with our share of the net gains on sales transactions by our unconsolidated affiliate, StoneRiver. 
  On   December 22, 2017  , the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act makes broad changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from   35 percent   to   21 percent   beginning in 2018; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) requiring U.S. federal taxable income to include certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; and (5) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense. The provisions of the Tax Act decreased our 2017 effective tax rate by   20.3%  , primarily due to the re-evaluation of the net deferred tax liability to reflect the lower federal tax rate of   21 percent  . The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from the reported amounts due to changes in interpretations and assumptions, as well as guidance that may be issued in the future. 
  Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate 
  During 2017 and 2015, StoneRiver recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2016, recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest, resulting in our share of StoneRiver income of   $32 million  ,   $147 million   and   $32 million   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Income from Discontinued Operations 
  Income from discontinued operations in 2017 included a litigation settlement related to a prior disposition of   $19 million  , net of income tax of   $7 million  , and earnings related to an acquired business held for sale. 
  Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing Operations 
  Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was   $5.71  ,   $4.15   and   $2.99   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted by discrete income tax benefits associated with the Tax Act of   $1.28   per share in 2017 and from our share of net investment gains, primarily from StoneRiver capital transactions, of   $0.09  ,   $0.39   and $0.07 per share in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted in   2017   and   2016   by merger and integration costs of   $0.23   and   $0.17   per share, respectively, and in 2015 by debt extinguishment and refinancing costs of $0.25 per share. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by   $0.49  ,   $0.46   and $0.53 per share in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  General 
  Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of   $325 million   and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of   $0.9 billion   at December 31,   2017  . The following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. 

Our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow, was   $1.48 billion   in   2017  ,   an increase   of   4%   compared to   $1.43 billion   in   2016  . This   increase   was primarily due to improved operating results, partially offset by   $106 million   of lower cash dividends received from our StoneRiver joint venture and unfavorable timing of payables. In   2017   and   2016  , we received cash dividends of   $45 million   and   $151 million  , respectively, from our StoneRiver joint venture. These dividends, in their entirety, represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities.  
  Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions, and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately   5%   of our total revenue in both   2017   and   2016  .  
  Share Repurchases 
  We purchased   $1.17 billion   and $1.20 billion of our common stock in   2017   and   2016  , respectively.   On November 16, 2016, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our common stock.   As of December 31,   2017  , we had approximately   10.7 million   shares remaining under this authorization. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. 
  Acquisitions and Dispositions 
  We completed four acquisitions in 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of   $384 million  , net of   $33 million   of acquired cash, and two acquisitions in 2016 for an aggregate purchase price of   $265 million  . We funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility. 
  In January 2018, we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of Monitise for proceeds of    37 million   (  $50 million  ). In addition, in February 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell a 55% interest of our lending solutions business, retaining a 45% interest in the joint venture.

Indebtedness 

At December 31,   2017  , our debt consisted primarily of   $3.3 billion   of senior notes,   $1.1 billion   of revolving credit facility borrowings and   $540 million   of term loan borrowings. Interest on our senior notes is paid semi-annually. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during   2017  . Additional information about our debt structure and associated instruments is included in Note   5   to the consolidated financial statements. 
  Variable Rate Debt 
  We maintain a   $2.0 billion   revolving credit agreement and a term loan with a syndicate of banks. Both the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate was   2.59%   on the revolving credit facility borrowings and   2.82%   on the term loan borrowings at December 31,   2017  . There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements on the revolving credit facility, which matures in April 2020. The outstanding principal balance on the term loan of   $540 million   is due at maturity in October 2018. At December 31, 2017, the term loan was classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility and the term loan contain various, substantially similar restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to: (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. 
  Other 
  Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31,   2017  , we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody s Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody s ) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard   Poor s Ratings Services ( S P ) on our senior unsecured debt securities. 
  The interest rates payable on our senior notes, revolving credit facility and term loan are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody s or S P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody s or S P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
  We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing. The following table details our contractual obligations at December 31,   2017  : 

(1) 
    Interest, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis. 
              (2) 
    The calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, the term loan is refinanced on a long-term basis under the revolving credit facility, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, and the variable rates on the revolving credit facility and term loan are priced at the rate in effect as of December 31,   2017  . 
      
  Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. Our senior management actively monitors these risks. 
  We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31,   2017  , a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in   2018   by approximately   $16 million  . 
  In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested into short-term, highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. Subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity. During   2017  , the subscriber funds daily average balance approximated   $1.2 billion  . A 1% increase or decrease in applicable interest rates would not have a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations. 
  We conduct business in the United States and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately   $150 million   as of December 31,   2017   to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. In   2017  , approximately   5%   of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31,   2017  , there would not have been a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Description of the Business 
  Fiserv, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ) provide financial services technology to clients worldwide, including banks, savings banks, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, billers, retailers, merchants, and building societies. The Company provides account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. The Company is principally located in the United States where it operates data and transaction processing centers, provides technology support, develops software and payment solutions, and offers consulting services. 
  The Company s operations are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products ( Payments ) segment and the Financial Institution Services ( Financial ) segment. Additional information regarding the Company s business segments is included in Note   9  . 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fiserv, Inc. and all   100%   owned subsidiaries. Investments in less than   50%   owned affiliates in which the Company has significant influence but not control are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2017-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting   ( ASU 2017-09 ), which provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting. Under ASU 2017-09, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the award are the same immediately before and after the award is modified. ASU 2017-09 is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted in any interim period. Entities must apply the standard prospectively. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-09 effective September 30, 2017 and will apply the guidance prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements going forward. 
  In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04,   Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment   ( ASU 2017-04 ), which eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test that had required a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Rather, entities should apply the same impairment assessment to all reporting units and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. ASU 2017-04 will be effective prospectively for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, or those beginning after January 1, 2017 if early adopted. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-04 in the first quarter of 2017. The adoption of this ASU did not have any   impact on t  he Company s consolidated   financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements going forward. 
  In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business   ( ASU 2017-01 ), which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance and providing a more robust framework to assist reporting organizations with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. For public entities, ASU 2017-01 is effective prospectively for fiscal years,  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for transactions occurring before the issuance or effective date of the standard for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-01 in the first quarter of 2017, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which adds or clarifies guidance on the presentation and classification of eight specific types of cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, with the intent of reducing diversity in practice. For public entities, ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented unless retrospective application is impracticable. The Company early adopted ASU 2016-15 in the first quarter of 2017, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment awards, including the accounting for income taxes and forfeitures, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The standard requires that all tax effects related to share-based payments be recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement at settlement or expiration and, accordingly, excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be presented as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-09 was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. The recognition of all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement, as well as related changes to the computation of diluted earnings per share, is to be applied prospectively. The impact of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements depends on the intrinsic value of share-based compensation awards at the time of exercise or vesting, resulting in more variability in effective tax rates and net earnings, and also impacting the dilution of common stock equivalents. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017. As a result of this adoption, the Company recorded excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards of   $48 million   in   2017   in the income tax provision, whereas such benefits were previously recognized in equity. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in the dilution of common stock equivalents for calculating diluted earnings per share. The Company elected to apply the change in presentation in the statement of cash flows prospectively, and as a result, excess tax benefits are classified as operating activities when realized through reductions to subsequent tax payments. The treatment of forfeitures did not change as the Company elected to continue its current practice of estimating expected forfeitures.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities   ( ASU 2017-12 ), which provides guidance designed to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity s risk management activities in its financial statements as well as to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. For public entities, ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted in any interim period or fiscal year. For cash flow and net investment hedges existing at the date of adoption, the standard requires a cumulative-effect adjustment related to eliminating the separate measurement of ineffectiveness to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amended presentation and disclosure guidance is required only prospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-12 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   ( ASU 2016-16 ), which eliminates the current prohibition on immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, with the intent of reducing complexity and diversity in practice. Under ASU 2016-16, entities must recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs rather than deferring recognition. For public entities, ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year. Entities must apply the guidance on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-16 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which prescribes an impairment model for most financial assets based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under this model, an estimate of   expected credit losses over the contractual life of the instrument is to be recorded as of the end of a reporting period as an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

collected on the financial asset.   For public entities, ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For most instruments, entities must apply the standard using a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for each lease with a term longer than twelve months. The recognized liability is measured at the present value of lease payments not yet paid, and the corresponding asset represents the lessee s right to use the underlying asset over the lease term and is based on the liability, subject to certain adjustments. For income statement purposes, the standard retains the dual model with leases classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ), which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements of financial instruments. For public entities, ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for certain provisions of the standard. Entities must apply the standard, with certain exceptions, using a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-01 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ), to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and to create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific requirements. It also includes guidance on accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining and costs incurred to fulfill a contract with a customer. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This model involves a five-step process for achieving that core principle, along with comprehensive disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard for one year and permit early adoption as of the original effective date in ASU 2014-09. For public entities, the new revenue standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities have the option of adopting this new guidance using either a full retrospective or a modified approach with the cumulative effect of applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. 
  The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition approach applied to all contracts, which results in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. Under this method, the Company will not restate the prior consolidated financial statements presented. However, the Company will be required to provide additional disclosures in 2018 related to the amount by which each relevant 2018 financial statement line item is affected by adoption of the new standard, and an explanation of the reasons for significant changes. 
  The Company has assessed the impacts of adopting this new revenue standard on its consolidated financial statements, related disclosures, accounting policies, and necessary control, process and systems changes, and expects the new revenue standard will not have an overall material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognition. The Company expects the accounting for stand-ready account- and transaction-based processing fees, the Company s most significant revenue stream, to remain substantially unchanged. Smaller impacted areas include the timing of revenue recognition of certain termination fees over the modified contract term, which will generally result in an acceleration of revenue as compared to the Company s current accounting practice of recognition upon client deconversion, and the deferral of professional services revenue from certain transaction processing platform enhancements that are currently recognized as performed. 
  The new standard requires the Company to change its accounting for costs to obtain a contract, such as the capitalization of commissions for sales personnel which are currently expensed as incurred, and also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting the new revenue standard on January 1, 2018 is an  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

increase in the opening balance of retained earnings of approximately   $210 million  , primarily related to the deferral of incremental sales commissions incurred in obtaining contracts in prior periods. 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company applies fair value accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in its consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value represents the amount that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
  The fair values of cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, settlement assets and obligations, accounts payable, and client deposits approximate their respective carrying values due to the short period of time to maturity. The estimated fair value of total debt is described in Note   5   and was based on quoted prices in active markets for the Company s senior notes (level 1 of the fair value hierarchy) and discounted cash flows based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rate for its term loan (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). The fair value of the Company s revolving credit facility borrowings approximates carrying value as the underlying interest rate is variable based on LIBOR. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability of   $15 million   at   December 31, 2017   (see Note   2  ) was based on the present value of a probability-weighted assessment approach derived from the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy) and is reported in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. This estimated fair value has not changed since the acquisition date. 
  Derivatives 
  Derivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the hedged item affects earnings. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings. To the extent the fair value hedge is effective, there is an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of hedges are recognized in earnings. The Company s policy is to enter into derivatives with creditworthy institutions and not to enter into such derivatives for speculative purposes. 
  Foreign Currency 
  Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, where the functional currency is the local currency, are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Gains and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company generates revenue from the delivery of processing, service and product solutions. Revenue is recognized when written contracts are signed, delivery has occurred, the fees are fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. 
  Processing and services revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily derived from contracts that generate account- and transaction-based fees for data processing, transaction processing, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer, and debit processing services. In addition, processing and services revenue is derived from the fulfillment of professional services, including consulting activities. Certain of the Company s revenue is generated from multiple element arrangements involving various combinations of product and service deliverables. The deliverables within these arrangements are evaluated at contract inception to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting, and if so, contract consideration is allocated to each deliverable based on relative selling price. The relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value, third-party evidence or best estimate of selling price. Revenue is then recognized in accordance with the appropriate revenue recognition guidance applicable to the respective elements. Also included in processing and services revenue is software maintenance fee revenue for ongoing client support, which is recognized ratably over the term of the applicable support period, generally   12 months  . Deferred revenue consists primarily of advance cash receipts for services and is recognized as revenue when the services are provided. 
  Product revenue is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales which represented less than   4%   of total revenue. For software license agreements that do not require significant customization or modification, the Company recognizes software license revenue upon delivery, assuming persuasive evidence of an  
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

arrangement exists, the license fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software are accounted for under contract accounting, with revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion method based upon efforts-expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. Changes in estimates for revenues, costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable and were not material for any period presented. 
  The Company includes reimbursements from clients, such as postage and telecommunication costs, in processing and services revenue and product revenue, while the related costs are included in cost of processing and services and cost of product. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and investments with original maturities of   90   days or less. 
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  The Company analyzes the collectability of trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, client creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in client payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. The allowance for doubtful accounts was   $15 million   at both December 31,   2017   and   2016  . 
  Prepaid Expenses 
  Prepaid expenses represent advance payments for goods and services to be consumed in the future, such as maintenance, postage and insurance, and totaled   $136 million   and   $141 million   at December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. 
  Settlement Assets and Obligations 
  Settlement assets of   $385 million   and   $312 million   were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets at December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively, and settlement obligations of   $379 million   and   $305 million   were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively. Settlement assets and obligations result from timing differences between collection and fulfillment of payment transactions primarily associated with the Company s walk-in and expedited bill payment service businesses. Settlement assets represent cash received or amounts receivable from agents, payment networks or directly from consumers. Settlement obligations represent amounts payable to clients and payees. 
  Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment are reported at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the leasehold period, if applicable. Property and equipment consisted of the following at December 31: 

Depreciation expense for all property and equipment totaled   $92 million  ,   $90 million   and   $80 million   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Routine maintenance of software products, design costs and other development costs incurred prior to the establishment of a product s technological feasibility are also expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized commencing when the technological feasibility of the software has been established. 
  Capitalized software development costs represent the capitalization of certain costs incurred to develop new software or to enhance existing software which is marketed externally or utilized by the Company to process client transactions. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally   five   years. Gross software development costs capitalized for new products and enhancements to existing products totaled   $159 million  ,   $143 million   and   $137 million   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Goodwill 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, the Company considers the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of the reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, the Company assesses numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that the Company assesses include its share price, its financial performance, market and competitive factors in its industry, and other events specific to its reporting units. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company performs a quantitative impairment test by comparing reporting unit carrying values to estimated fair values.   No   impairment was identified in the Company s annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of   2017   as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units exceeded the carrying values. In addition, there is   no   accumulated impairment loss through December 31,   2017  . The changes in goodwill during   2017   and   2016   were as follows: 

Asset Impairment 
  The Company reviews property and equipment, intangible assets and its investment in unconsolidated affiliate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company reviews capitalized software development costs for impairment at each balance sheet date. Recoverability of property and equipment, capitalized software development costs, and other intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or the net realizable value of the asset, depending on the type of asset. The Company s investment in unconsolidated affiliate is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to its estimated fair value and is impaired if any decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. 
  Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 
  Accounts payable and accrued expenses consisted of the following at December 31: 

Income Taxes 
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is  
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

recorded against deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component, net of income taxes, consisted of the following: 

Based on the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at   December 31, 2017  , the Company estimates that it will recognize approximately   $6 million   in interest expense during the next twelve months related to settled interest rate hedge contracts. 
  The Company has entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. As of December 31,   2017   and   2016  , the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately   $150 million   and   $86 million  , respectively, and the fair value totaling approximately   $8 million   and   $1 million  , respectively, is reported in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. 
  Net Income Per Share 
  Net income per share in each period is calculated using actual, unrounded amounts. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents consist of stock options and restricted stock units and are computed using the treasury stock method. In   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , the Company excluded   0.7 million  ,   0.8 million   and   0.9 million   weighted-average shares, respectively, from the calculations of common stock equivalents for anti-dilutive stock options. 
  The computation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per share is as follows:

On   December 22, 2017  , the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Tax Act ). The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax code by, among other things, lowering the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from   35 percent   to   21 percent   beginning in 2018 and requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company has recorded a net tax benefit of   $275 million   as a result of the Tax Act; however, the Company s accounting for certain elements of the Tax Act continues to be evaluated. The Company was able to make reasonable estimates of certain effects and has recorded provisional adjustments as follows: 
  Reduction of U.S. Federal Corporate Tax Rate and Other Provisions     The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to   21 percent  , effective   January 1, 2018  . The Company has recorded a provisional decrease of   $270 million   to the net deferred tax liability, with a corresponding adjustment to deferred income tax benefit, for the year ended December 31, 2017. While the Company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the corporate rate reduction, it may be affected by other analyses related to the Tax Act, including, but not limited to, the Company s calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences. The Company has also recorded a provisional current income tax benefit of   $5 million   for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to other provisions of the Tax Act. 
  Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax     The Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax ( Transition Tax ) is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The Company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and has recorded   zero   as its provisional Transition Tax obligation. The Company is continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of expense related to the Transition Tax enactment. 
  The Company was not able to make reasonable estimates, and has not recorded provisional adjustments, for the following elements of the Tax Act. However, the potential impacts would not be material to the Company s annual income from continuing operations or financial position. 
  Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI )     The Tax Act creates a new requirement that certain income, such as GILTI, earned by a controlled foreign corporation must be included in the gross income of its U.S. shareholder.  Because of the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, the Company is not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of the Tax Act and is continuing to evaluate this provision of the Tax Act and the application of applicable accounting guidance. Therefore, the Company has not made any adjustments in its consolidated financial statements and has not determined whether to record deferred taxes on GILTI. 
  Repatriation Intentions and Impacts     The Company is currently analyzing its global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation, but has yet to determine whether it plans to change its prior assertion. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any deferred taxes attributable to investments in foreign subsidiaries for which it is permanently reinvested. The Company will record the tax effects of any change in its prior assertion in the period that it completes its analysis and is able to make a reasonable estimate. 
  Unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: 

At December 31,   2017  , unrecognized tax benefits of   $37 million  , net of federal and state benefits, would affect the effective income tax rate from continuing operations if recognized. In   2018  , reductions to unrecognized tax benefits for decreases in tax positions taken in prior years, settlements and the lapse of statutes of limitations are estimated to total approximately   $10 million  . The Company classifies interest expense and penalties related to income taxes as components of its income tax provision. The income tax provision from continuing operations included interest expense and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of less than   $1 million   in each of   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  . Accrued interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled   $3 million   and   $2 million   at December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.

  7. Employee Stock and Savings Plans 
  Stock Plans 
  The Company recognizes the fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees in cost of processing and services, cost of product, and selling, general and administrative expense in its consolidated statements of income. 
  The Company s share-based compensation primarily consists of the following: 
  Stock Options     The Company grants stock options to employees and non-employee directors at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company s stock on the dates of grant, which are typically in the first quarter of the year. Stock options generally vest over a   three  -year period beginning on the first anniversary of the grant. All stock options expire   ten   years from the date of the award. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the stock options over the requisite service period of the stock option award. 
  Restricted Stock Units     The Company awards restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. The Company recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock units based on the market price of the common stock on the date of award over the period during which the awards vest. Restricted stock units generally vest over a   three  -year period beginning on the second anniversary of the award.   
  Performance Share Units     The Company awards performance share units to employees. The number of shares issued at the end of the performance period is determined by the level of achievement of pre-determined earnings and revenue growth performance goals. The Company recognizes the expense, which is determined by utilizing a probability assessment that the performance goals will be achieved, ratably over the requisite performance period of the award. 
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan     The Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of common stock each quarter through payroll deductions at   85%   of the closing price of the Company s common stock on the last business day of each calendar quarter. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the   15%   discount on the purchase date. 
  Share-based compensation expense was   $63 million   in   2017  ,   $68 million   in   2016   and   $65 million   in   2015  . Share-based compensation in 2017 and 2016 includes expense recognized on performance share units as management views the performance goals as probable of attainment. The income tax benefits related to share-based compensation totaled   $21 million  ,   $23 million   and   $22 million   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. At December 31,   2017  , the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost for unvested stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units, net of estimated forfeitures, of   $64 million   is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.3   years. 
  The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was   $37.53  ,   $31.47   and   $25.51   per share, respectively. The fair values of stock options granted were estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions:   

  The Company determined the expected life of stock options using historical data adjusted for known factors that could alter historical exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect as of the grant date. Expected volatility is determined using weighted-average implied market volatility combined with historical volatility. The Company believes that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than purely historical volatility.

  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Exhibit 

EXHIBIT 10.1 
  FISERV, INC.  
  AMENDED AND RESTATED 2007 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN  
           1. 
    Purpose and Effective Date.  
     (a)    Purpose  . The Fiserv, Inc. 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan has two complementary purposes: (i) to attract and retain outstanding individuals to serve as officers, directors, employees and consultants; and (ii) to increase shareholder value. The Plan will provide participants incentives to increase shareholder value by offering the opportunity to acquire shares of the Company s common stock, receive monetary payments based on the value of such common stock, or receive other incentive compensation, on the potentially favorable terms that this Plan provides.  
  (b)    Effective Date  . This Plan became effective on May 23, 2007, the date that the Plan was initially approved by the Company s shareholders (the    Effective Date   ). Upon approval of this Plan, the Fiserv, Inc. Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan terminated on the Effective Date and the Fiserv, Inc. Executive Incentive Compensation Plan terminated on December 31, 2007, and no new awards may be granted under such plans after their respective termination dates; provided that each such plan shall continue to govern awards outstanding as of the date of such plan s termination and such awards shall continue in force and effect until terminated pursuant to their terms. This Plan was amended and restated effective on May 22, 2013, the date that the amendment and restatement of the Plan was approved by the Company s shareholders. The Plan was further amended and restated effective as of December 2, 2013 (the    Restatement Date   ) to make the adjustments required by the Plan as a result of the two-for-one split of the Stock effective as of the close of business on the Restatement Date (the    Stock Split   ).  All Share numbers in the Plan have been adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.  The Plan was most recently amended and restated effective on February 20, 2018 (the    Second Restatement Date   ). 
           2. 
    Definitions.   Capitalized terms used in this Plan have the following meanings  :  
     (a)     Administrator    means the Committee with respect to employee Participants and the Board with respect to Director Participants.  
  (b)     Affiliate    and    Associate    shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining those individuals to whom an Option or Stock Appreciation Right may be granted, the term  Affiliate  means any entity that, directly or through one or more intermediaries, is controlled by, controls, or is under common control with the Company within the meaning of Code Sections 414(b) or (c); provided that, in applying such provisions, the phrase  at least 20 percent  shall be used in place of  at least 80 percent  each place it appears therein.  
  (c)     Award    means a grant of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Dividend Equivalent Units, an Annual Incentive Award, a Long-Term Incentive Award, or any other type of award permitted under the Plan.

result of an agreement, arrangement or understanding to vote such security if the agreement, arrangement or understanding: (A) arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given to such Person in response to a public proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable rules and regulations under the Act and (B) is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor report); or

In addition to the authority specifically granted to the Administrator in this Plan, the Administrator has full discretionary authority to administer this Plan, including but not limited to the authority to: (i) interpret the provisions of this Plan, (ii) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to this Plan, (iii) prescribe the terms of any agreements under this Plan, (iv) correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in any Award or agreement covering an Award in the manner and to the extent it deems desirable to carry this Plan into effect, and (v) make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of this Plan. All Administrator determinations shall be made in the sole discretion of the Administrator and are final and binding on all interested parties.  
  (b)    Delegation to Other Committees or Officers  . To the extent applicable law permits, the Board may delegate to another committee of the Board, or the Committee may delegate to one or more officers of the Company, any or all of their respective authority and responsibility as an Administrator of the Plan; provided that no such delegation is permitted with respect to Stock-based Awards made to Section 16 Participants at the time any such delegated authority or responsibility is exercised unless the delegation is to another committee of the Board consisting entirely of Non-Employee Directors. If the Board or the Committee has made such a delegation, then all references to the Administrator in this Plan include such other committee or one or more officers to the extent of such delegation.  
  (c)    Indemnification  . The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Board and the Committee, and each officer or member of any other committee to whom a delegation under Section 3(b) has been made, as to any acts or omissions with respect to this Plan or any Award to the maximum extent that the law and the Company s by-laws permit.  
  4.  Eligibility.   The Administrator may designate any of the following as a Participant from time to time, to the extent of the Administrator s authority: any officer or other employee of the Company or its Affiliates; an individual that the Company or an Affiliate has engaged to become an officer or employee; a consultant who provides services to the Company or its Affiliates; or a Director, including a Non-Employee Director. The Administrator s granting of an Award to a Participant will not require the Administrator to grant an Award to such individual at any future time. The Administrator s granting of a particular type of Award to a Participant will not require the Administrator to grant any other type of Award to such individual.  
  5.  Types of Awards.   Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Administrator may grant any type of Award to any Participant it selects, but only employees of the Company or a Subsidiary may receive grants of incentive stock options within the meaning of Code Section 422. Awards may be granted alone or in addition to, in tandem with, or in substitution for any other Award (or any other award granted under another plan of the Company or any Affiliate).  
           6. 
    Shares Reserved under this Plan.  
     (a)    Plan Reserve  . Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18, an aggregate of 33,406,738 Shares are reserved for issuance under this Plan after the Restatement Date, representing the number of Shares remaining available for future grants of Awards on the Restatement Date plus the number of Shares subject to outstanding Awards on the Restatement Date. The Shares reserved for issuance may be either authorized and unissued Shares or shares reacquired at any time and now or hereafter held as treasury stock.  
  (b)    Aggregate Award Limits  . Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18, the Company may issue only an aggregate of 5,000,000 Shares upon the exercise of incentive stock options after the Restatement Date and 

5 

may issue only an aggregate of 22,616,402 Shares pursuant to  full-value awards  after the Restatement Date. For this purpose, a full-value award includes Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units (valued in relation to a Share), Dividend Equivalent Units, and any other similar Award under which the value of the Award is measured as the full value of a Share, rather than the increase in the value of a Share.  
  (c)    Replenishment of Shares Under this Plan  . With respect to Awards that are settleable in Stock, the aggregate number of Shares reserved under Section 6(a) shall be depleted at the time of grant by the target number of Shares with respect to which an Award is granted.  If more than the target number of Shares with respect to an Award are earned, then the number of Shares reserved under this Section 6(a) shall be depleted at the time of settlement by such additional Shares.  To the extent that Shares covered by an Award are not issued due to the lapse, expiration, termination or cancellation of an Award, or if Shares are forfeited under an Award, or if Shares are issued under any Award and the Company subsequently reacquires them pursuant to rights reserved upon the issuance of the Shares, then such Shares may again be used for new Awards under this Plan under Section 6(a) and Section 6(b), but such Shares may not be issued pursuant to incentive stock options. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the following Shares be recredited to the Plan s reserve: (i) Shares issued under the Plan that are purchased by the Company using proceeds from Option exercises; (ii) Shares tendered or withheld in payment of the exercise price of an Option or as a result of the net settlement of an outstanding Stock Appreciation Right; or (iii) Shares tendered or withheld to satisfy federal, state or local tax withholding obligations. 
  7.  Options.   Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Administrator will determine all terms and conditions of each Option, including but not limited to: (i) whether the Option is an  incentive stock option  which meets the requirements of Code Section 422, or a  nonqualified stock option  which does not meet the requirements of Code Section 422; (ii) the number of Shares subject to the Option; (iii) the exercise price, which may not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Option as determined on the date of grant; (iv) the terms and conditions of exercise; and (v) the term, except that an Option must terminate no later than ten (10) years after the date of grant. In all other respects, the terms of any incentive stock option should comply with the provisions of Code Section 422 except to the extent the Administrator determines otherwise. If an Option that is intended to be an incentive stock option fails to meet the requirements thereof, the Option shall automatically be treated as a nonqualified stock option to the extent of such failure.  
  8.  Stock Appreciation Rights.   Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Administrator will determine all terms and conditions of each SAR, including but not limited to: (a) whether the SAR is granted independently of an Option or relates to an Option; (b) the number of Shares to which the SAR relates; (c) the grant price, provided that the grant price shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the SAR as determined on the date of grant; (d) the terms and conditions of exercise or maturity; (e) the term, provided that an SAR must terminate no later than ten (10) years after the date of grant; and (f) whether the SAR will be settled in cash, Shares or a combination thereof.  If an SAR is granted in relation to an Option, then unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, the SAR shall be exercisable or shall mature at the same time or times, on the same conditions and to the extent and in the proportion, that the related Option is exercisable and may be exercised or mature for all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option. Upon exercise of any number of SARs, the number of Shares subject to the related Option shall be reduced accordingly and such Option may not be exercised with respect to that number of Shares. The exercise of any number of Options that relate to an SAR shall likewise result in an equivalent reduction in the number of Shares covered by the related SAR.  
  9.  Performance and Stock Awards.   Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Administrator will determine all terms and conditions of each award of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units, including but not limited to: (a) the number of Shares and/or units to which such Award relates; (b) whether, as a condition for the Participant to realize all or a portion of the benefit provided under the Award, one or more Performance Goals must be achieved during such period as the Administrator specifies; (c) whether the restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall lapse, and all or a portion of the Performance Goals subject to an Award shall be deemed achieved, upon a Participant s death, Disability or Retirement, or such other circumstances as the Administrator may specify; (d) with respect to Performance Units, whether to measure the value of each unit in relation to a designated dollar value or the Fair Market Value of one or more Shares; and (e) with respect to Restricted Stock Units and Performance Units, whether to settle such Awards in cash, in Shares, or a combination thereof.  
  
   6 

10.  Annual Incentive Awards  . Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Administrator will determine all terms and conditions of an Annual Incentive Award, including but not limited to the Performance Goals, performance period, the potential amount payable, and the timing of payment, subject to the following: (a) the Administrator must require that payment of all or any portion of the amount subject to the Annual Incentive Award is contingent on the achievement of one or more Performance Goals during the period the Administrator specifies, although the Administrator may specify that all or a portion of the Performance Goals subject to an Award are deemed achieved upon a Participant s death, Disability or Retirement, or such other circumstances as the Administrator may specify; and (b) the performance period must relate to a period of one fiscal year of the Company except that, if the Award is made in the year this Plan becomes effective, at the time of commencement of employment with the Company or on the occasion of a promotion, then the Award may relate to a period shorter than one fiscal year.  Nothing herein shall preclude the Administrator from providing other cash incentive payments outside of the terms of the Plan.   
  11.  Long-Term Incentive Awards.   Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Administrator will determine all terms and conditions of a Long-Term Incentive Award, including but not limited to the Performance Goals, performance period, the potential amount payable, and the timing of payment, subject to the following: (a) the Administrator must require that payment of all or any portion of the amount subject to the Long-Term Incentive Award is contingent on the achievement of one or more Performance Goals during the period the Administrator specifies, although the Administrator may specify that all or a portion of the Performance Goals subject to an Award are deemed achieved upon a Participant s death, Disability or Retirement, or such other circumstances as the Administrator may specify; and (b) the performance period must relate to a period of more than one fiscal year of the Company.  Nothing herein shall preclude the Administrator from providing other cash incentive payments outside of the terms of the Plan. 
  12.  Dividend Equivalent Units.  . Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Administrator will determine all terms and conditions of each award of Dividend Equivalent Units, including but not limited to whether: (a) such Award will be granted in tandem with another Award; (b) payment of the Award be made currently or credited to an account for the Participant which provides for the deferral of such amounts until a stated time; and (c) the Award will be settled in cash or Shares; provided that any Dividend Equivalent Units granted in connection with an Option, Stock Appreciation Right or other  stock right  within the meaning of Code Section 409A shall be set forth in a written arrangement that is separate from such Award, and to the extent the payment of such dividend equivalents is considered deferred compensation, such written arrangement shall comply with the provisions of Code Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Dividend Equivalent Unit granted in tandem with another Award on and after the Second Restatement Date shall provide for payment only if, when, and only to the same extent, such other Award vests. 
  13.  Other Stock-Based Awards  . Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Administrator may grant to Participants other types of Awards, which may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Shares, either alone or in addition to or in conjunction with other Awards, and payable in Stock or cash. Without limitation, such Award may include the issuance of shares of unrestricted Stock, which may be awarded in payment of director fees, in lieu of cash compensation, in exchange for cancellation of a compensation right, as a bonus, or upon the attainment of Performance Goals or otherwise, or rights to acquire Stock from the Company. The Administrator shall determine all terms and conditions of the Award, including but not limited to, the time or times at which such Awards shall be made, and the number of Shares to be granted pursuant to such Awards or to which such Award shall relate; provided that any Award that provides for purchase rights shall be priced at 100% of Fair Market Value on the date of the Award.  
  14.  Minimum Vesting Period  .  All Awards granted on and after the Second Restatement Date shall have a minimum vesting period of one year from the date of grant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may grant Awards with less than a one-year vesting requirement, provided such Awards do not relate to more than 5% of the Plan s Shares available for Awards as of the Second Restatement Date. 
  15.  Transferability  . Awards are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless and to the extent the Administrator allows a Participant to: (a) designate in writing a beneficiary to exercise the Award or receive payment under an Award after the Participant s death; or (b) transfer an Award for no consideration.  

7 

16. 
    Termination and Amendment of Plan; Amendment, Modification or Cancellation of Awards.  
     (a)    Term of Plan  . Unless the Board earlier terminates this Plan pursuant to Section 16(b), this Plan will terminate when all Shares reserved for issuance have been issued.  If the term of this Plan extends beyond ten (10) years from the Effective Date, no incentive stock options may be granted after such time unless the shareholders of the Company have approved an extension of this Plan. 
  (b)    Termination and Amendment  . The Board or the Committee may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate this Plan at any time, subject to the following limitations:  
  (i)     the Board must approve any amendment of this Plan to the extent the Company determines such approval is required by: (A) action of the Board, (B) applicable corporate law, or (C) any other applicable law;  
  (ii)     shareholders must approve any amendment of this Plan to the extent the Company determines such approval is required by: (A) Section 16 of the Exchange Act, (B) the Code, (C) the listing requirements of any principal securities exchange or market on which the Shares are then traded, or (D) any other applicable law; and  
  (iii)     shareholders must approve any of the following Plan amendments: (A) an amendment to materially increase any number of Shares specified in Section 6(a) (except as permitted by Section 18), or (B) an amendment that would diminish the protections afforded by Section 16 (e).  
  (c)    Amendment, Modification or Cancellation of Awards  . Except as provided in Section 16(e) and subject to the requirements of this Plan, the Administrator may modify, amend or cancel any Award, or waive any restrictions or conditions applicable to any Award or the exercise of the Award; provided that any modification or amendment that materially diminishes the rights of the Participant, or the cancellation of the Award, shall be effective only if agreed to by the Participant or any other person(s) as may then have an interest in the Award, but the Administrator need not obtain Participant (or other interested party) consent for the adjustment or cancellation of an Award pursuant to the provisions of Section 18 or the modification of an Award to the extent deemed necessary to comply with any applicable law, the listing requirements of any principal securities exchange or market on which the Shares are then traded, or to preserve favorable accounting or tax treatment of any Award for the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, any such amendment shall be made in a manner that will enable an Award intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A to continue to be so exempt, or to enable an Award intended to comply with Code Section 409A to continue to so comply.  
  (d)    Survival of Authority and Awards  . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority of the Board and the Administrator under this Section 16 and to otherwise administer the Plan will extend beyond the date of this Plan s termination. In addition, termination of this Plan will not affect the rights of Participants with respect to Awards previously granted to them, and all unexpired Awards will continue in force and effect after termination of this Plan except as they may lapse or be terminated by their own terms and conditions.  
  (e)    Repricing and Backdating Prohibited  . Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, and except for the adjustments provided in Section 18, neither the Administrator nor any other person may (i) decrease the exercise price for any outstanding Option or SAR after the date of grant, (ii) allow a Participant to surrender an outstanding Option or SAR to the Company as consideration for the grant of a new Option or SAR with a lower exercise price, or (iii) cancel an outstanding Option or SAR with an exercise price above the current Fair Market Value of a Share in exchange for cash or other securities.  In addition, the Administrator may not make a grant of an Option or SAR with a grant date that is effective prior to the date the Administrator takes action to approve such Award.  
  (f)    Foreign Participation  . To assure the viability of Awards granted to Participants employed or residing in foreign countries, the Administrator may provide for such special terms as it may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom. Moreover, the Administrator may approve such supplements to, or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of, this Plan as it determines is necessary or appropriate for such purposes. Any such amendment, restatement or alternative versions that the Administrator approves for purposes of using this Plan in a foreign country will not affect the terms of this Plan for any other country. In addition, all such supplements, amendments, restatements or alternative versions must comply with the provisions of Section 16(b)(ii).  
  
   8 

(g)    Code Section 409A  . The provisions of Code Section 409A are incorporated herein by reference to the extent necessary for any Award that is subject to Code Section 409A to comply therewith.  
   (a)    Withholding  . In the event the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is required to withhold any Federal, state or local taxes or other amounts in respect of any income recognized by a Participant as a result of the grant, vesting, payment or settlement of an Award or disposition of any Shares acquired under an Award, the Company may deduct (or require an Affiliate to deduct) from any payments of any kind otherwise due the Participant cash, or with the consent of the Committee, Shares otherwise deliverable or vesting under an Award, to satisfy such tax obligations. Alternatively, the Company may require such Participant to pay to the Company, in cash, promptly on demand, or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment to the Company of the aggregate amount of any such taxes and other amounts. If Shares are deliverable upon exercise or payment of an Award, the Committee may permit a Participant to satisfy all or a portion of the Federal, state and local withholding tax obligations arising in connection with such Award by electing to (a) have the Company withhold Shares otherwise issuable under the Award, (b) tender back Shares received in connection with such Award, or (c) deliver other previously owned Shares; provided that from and after the Second Restatement Date, the amount to be withheld may not exceed the total maximum statutory tax withholding obligations associated with the transaction to the extent needed for the Company to avoid an accounting charge. If an election is provided, the election must be made on or before the date as of which the amount of tax to be withheld is determined and otherwise as the Committee requires. In any case, the Company may defer making payment or delivery under any Award if any such tax may be pending unless and until indemnified to its satisfaction.  
  (b)    No Guarantee of Tax Treatment  . Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan, the Company does not guarantee to any Participant or any other Person with an interest in an Award that (i) any Award intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A shall be so exempt, (ii) any Award intended to comply with Code Section 409A or Code Section 422 shall so comply, (iii) any Award shall otherwise receive a specific tax treatment under any other applicable tax law, nor in any such case will the Company or any Affiliate indemnify, defend or hold harmless any individual with respect to the tax consequences of any Award.  
           18. 
    Adjustment Provisions; Change of Control.  
     (a)    Adjustment of Shares  . If: (i) the Company shall at any time be involved in a merger or other transaction in which the Shares are changed or exchanged; (ii) the Company shall subdivide or combine the Shares or the Company shall declare a dividend payable in Shares, other securities (other than preferred stock purchase rights issued pursuant to the terms of the Company s Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated as of February 24, 1998, as amended from time to time, or any successor to such Rights Agreement, or any similar stock purchase rights that the Company may authorize and issue in the future) or other property; (iii) the Company shall effect a cash dividend the amount of which, on a per Share basis, exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share at the time the dividend is declared, or the Company shall effect any other dividend or other distribution on the Shares in the form of cash, or a repurchase of Shares, that the Board determines by resolution is special or extraordinary in nature or that is in connection with a transaction that the Company characterizes publicly as a recapitalization or reorganization involving the Shares; or (iv) any other event shall occur, which, in the case of this clause (iv), in the judgment of the Board or Committee necessitates an adjustment to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Plan, then the Administrator shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Plan, adjust as applicable: (A) the number and type of Shares subject to this Plan (including the number and type of Shares described in Sections 6(a) and (b)) and which may after the event be made the subject of Awards; (B) the number and type of Shares subject to outstanding Awards; (C) the grant, purchase, or exercise price with respect to any Award; and (D) the Performance Goals of an Award. In each case, with respect to Awards of incentive stock options, no such adjustment may be authorized to the extent that such authority would cause this Plan to violate Code Section 422(b). Without limitation, in the event of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination or other similar corporate transaction or event, whether or not constituting a Change of Control (other than any such transaction in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the outstanding Stock is not being converted into or exchanged for different securities, cash or other property, or any combination thereof), the Administrator may substitute, on an equitable basis as the Administrator determines, for each Share then subject  
  
   9 

to an Award and the Shares subject to this Plan (if the Plan will continue in effect), the number and kind of shares of stock, other securities, cash or other property to which holders of Stock are or will be entitled in respect of each Share pursuant to the transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a stock dividend (other than a stock dividend declared in lieu of an ordinary cash dividend) or subdivision or combination of the Shares (including a reverse stock split), if no action is taken by the Administrator, adjustments contemplated by this subsection that are proportionate shall nevertheless automatically be made as of the date of such stock dividend or subdivision or combination of the Shares.  
  (b)    Issuance or Assumption  . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, and without affecting the number of Shares otherwise reserved or available under this Plan, in connection with any merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, or reorganization, the Administrator may authorize the issuance or assumption of awards under this Plan upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate.  
  (c)    Change of Control  . If the Participant has in effect an employment, retention, change of control, severance or similar agreement with the Company or any Affiliate that discusses the effect of a Change of Control on the Participant s Awards, then such agreement shall control. In all other cases, unless provided otherwise in an Award agreement and notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, in the event of a Change of Control:  
  (i)     The successor or purchaser in the Change of Control transaction may assume an Award or provide a substitute award with similar terms and conditions, and preserving the same benefits, as the Award it is replacing.  
  (ii)     If the successor or purchaser in the Change of Control transaction does not assume the Awards or issue replacement awards as provided in clause (i), then unless otherwise determined by the Board prior to the date of the Change of Control, immediately prior to the date of the Change of Control:  
  (A)  each Option or SAR that is then held by a Participant who is employed by or in the service of the Company or an Affiliate shall become immediately and fully vested, and all Options and SARs shall be cancelled on the date of the Change of Control in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess of the Change of Control price of the Shares covered by the Option or SAR that is so cancelled over the purchase or grant price of such Shares under the Award;  
  (B)  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units that are not then vested shall vest;  
  (C)  all Performance Shares and/or Performance Units that are earned but not yet paid shall be paid in cash in an amount equal to the value of the Performance Share and/or Performance Unit, and all Performance Shares and Performance Units for which the performance period has not expired shall be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the product of the value of the Performance Share and/or Performance Unit and a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole months that have elapsed from the beginning of the performance period to which the Award is subject to the date of the Change of Control and the denominator of which is the number of whole months in the performance period;  
   (D)  all Annual and Long-Term Incentive Awards that are earned but not yet paid shall be paid, and all Annual and Long-Term Incentive Awards that are not yet earned shall be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment in an amount determined by taking the product of: (1) the amount that would have been due under such Award(s) if the Performance Goals (as measured at the time of the Change of Control) were to continue to be achieved at the same rate through the end of the performance period; and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole months that have elapsed from the beginning of the performance period to which the Award is subject to the date of the Change of Control and the denominator of which is the number of whole months in the performance period; and  
  (E)  all Dividend Equivalent Units that are not vested shall vest (to the same extent as the Award granted in tandem with the Dividend Equivalent Unit, if applicable) and be paid in cash. 
  (F)  All other Awards that are not vested shall vest and if an amount is payable under such vested Award, such amount shall be paid in cash based on the value of the Award.  
  
   10 

If the value of an Award is based on the Fair Market Value of a Share, Fair Market Value shall be deemed to mean the per share Change of Control price. The Administrator shall determine the per share Change of Control price paid or deemed paid in the Change of Control transaction.  
  Except as otherwise expressly provided in any agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, if the receipt of any payment by a Participant under the circumstances described above would result in the payment by the Participant of any excise tax provided for in Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code, then the amount of such payment shall be reduced to the extent required to prevent the imposition of such excise tax.  
   (a)    Other Terms and Conditions  . The grant of any Award may also be subject to other provisions (whether or not applicable to the Award granted to any other Participant) as the Administrator determines appropriate, including, without limitation, provisions for:  
  (i)     the payment of the purchase price of Options by delivery of cash or other Shares or other securities of the Company (including by attestation) having a then Fair Market Value equal to the purchase price of such Shares, or by delivery (including by fax) to the Company or its designated agent of an executed irrevocable option exercise form together with irrevocable instructions to a broker dealer to sell or margin a sufficient portion of the Shares and deliver the sale or margin loan proceeds directly to the Company to pay for the exercise price;  
  (ii)     restrictions on resale or other disposition of Shares; and  
  (iii)     compliance with federal or state securities laws and stock exchange requirements.  
  (b)    Employment and Service  . The issuance of an Award shall not confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continued employment or service with the Company or any Affiliate, or the right to continue as a Director. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, for purposes of the Plan and all Awards, the following rules shall apply:  
  (i)     a Participant who transfers employment between the Company and its Affiliates, or between Affiliates, will not be considered to have terminated employment;  
  (ii)     a Participant who ceases to be a Non-Employee Director because he or she becomes an employee of the Company or an Affiliate shall not be considered to have ceased service as a Director with respect to any Award until such Participant s termination of employment with the Company and its Affiliates;  
  (iii)     a Participant who ceases to be employed by the Company or an Affiliate and immediately thereafter becomes a Non-Employee Director, a non-employee director of an Affiliate, or a consultant to the Company or any Affiliate shall not be considered to have terminated employment until such Participant s service as a director of, or consultant to, the Company and its Affiliates has ceased; and  
   (iv) a Participant employed by an Affiliate will be considered to have terminated employment when such entity ceases to be an Affiliate.  
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of an Award that is subject to Code Section 409A, if a Participant s termination of employment or service triggers the payment of compensation under such Award, then the Participant will be deemed to have terminated employment or service upon his or her  separation from service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A.  
  (c)    No Fractional Shares  . No fractional Shares or other securities may be issued or delivered pursuant to this Plan, and the Administrator may determine whether cash, other securities or other property will be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares or other securities, or whether such fractional Shares or other securities or any rights to fractional Shares or other securities will be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.  
  (d)    Unfunded Plan  . This Plan is unfunded and does not create, and should not be construed to create, a trust or separate fund with respect to this Plan s benefits. This Plan does not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or other person. To the extent any person holds any rights by virtue of an  

11 

Award granted under this Plan, such rights are no greater than the rights of the Company s general unsecured creditors.  
  (e)    Requirements of Law and Securities Exchange  . The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares in connection with an Award are subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any award agreement, the Company has no liability to deliver any Shares under this Plan or make any payment unless such delivery or payment would comply with all applicable laws and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity, and unless and until the Participant has taken all actions required by the Company in connection therewith. The Company may impose such restrictions on any Shares issued under the Plan as the Company determines necessary or desirable to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations or the requirements of any national securities exchanges.  
  (f)    Governing Law  . This Plan, and all agreements under this Plan, will be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Wisconsin, without reference to any conflict of law principles. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Plan, any Award or any award agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Plan, any Award or any award agreement, may only be heard in a  bench  trial, and any party to such action or proceeding shall agree to waive its right to a jury trial.  
  (g)    Limitations on Actions  . Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Plan, any Award or any award agreement, must be brought within one year (365 days) after the day the complaining party first knew or should have known of the events giving rise to the complaint.  
  (h)    Construction  . Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine, they shall be construed as though they were used in the feminine in all cases where they would so apply; and wherever any words are used in the singular or plural, they shall be construed as though they were used in the plural or singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply. Titles of sections are for general information only, and this Plan is not to be construed with reference to such titles.  
  (i)    Severability  . If any provision of this Plan or any award agreement or any Award (a) is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person or Award, or (b) would disqualify this Plan, any award agreement or any Award under any law the Administrator deems applicable, then such provision should be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Administrator, materially altering the intent of this Plan, award agreement or Award, then such provision should be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of this Plan, such award agreement and such Award will remain in full force and effect.

APPENDIX A 
  PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION  
  UNDER CODE SECTION 162(m) 
    
  1.      Application of Appendix A  .  This Appendix A applies to Awards under which 162(m) Compensation (as defined below) is payable, and the provisions hereof take precedence over any contrary provision of the Plan.  Such Awards are referred to herein as  Grandfathered Awards.  The term  162(m) Compensation  means compensation payable under a written binding contract that was in effect as of November 2, 2017, and that is not materially modified thereafter (all within the meaning of Code Section 162(m)), and that otherwise qualifies as  performance-based compensation  under Section 162(m) of the Code as in effect prior to January 1, 2018.  To the extent any changes to the Plan as of the Second Restatement Date would cause a Grandfathered Award to cease to qualify as such, such changes shall not be applicable to such Award. 
  2.      Performance Goals  .  With respect to Grandfathered Awards, the Committee may establish one or more performance goals that relate to one or more of the following with respect to the Company or any one or more of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or other business units: net sales; cost of sales; revenue; gross income; net income; operating income; income from continuing operations; earnings (including before taxes, and/or interest and/or depreciation and amortization); earnings per share (including diluted earnings per share); price per share; cash flow; net cash provided by operating activities; net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities; net operating profit; ratio of debt to debt plus equity; return on shareholder equity; return on capital; return on assets; operating working capital; average accounts receivable; economic value added; customer satisfaction; operating margin; profit margin; sales performance; sales quota attainment; new sales; cross/integrated sales; client engagement; client acquisition; net promoter score; internal revenue growth; and client retention. As to each Performance Goal, the relevant measurement of performance shall be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, if applicable; provided that, the Committee may, at the time of establishing the Performance Goal(s), exclude the effects of (i) extraordinary, unusual and/or non-recurring items of gain or loss, (ii) gains or losses on the disposition of a business, (iii) changes in tax or accounting regulations or laws, or (iv) the effect of a merger or acquisition.  Where applicable, the Performance Goals may be expressed, without limitation, in terms of attaining a specified level of the particular criterion or the attainment of an increase or decrease (expressed as absolute numbers or a percentage) in the particular criterion or achievement in relation to a peer group or other index.  The Performance Goals may include a threshold level of performance below which no payment will be made (or no vesting will occur), levels of performance at which specified payments will be paid (or specified vesting will occur), and a maximum level of performance above which no additional payment will be made (or at which full vesting will occur). 
  3.      Administration  .      For purposes of administering a Grandfathered Award, each member of the Committee must qualify as an  outside director  within the meaning of Code Section 162(m).  
  4.      Individual Participant Limitations  .    Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18 of the Plan, no Participant may be granted Grandfathered Awards in any fiscal year of the Company that would result in the Participant receiving:  
                        
    (a) 
    Options for, and/or Stock Appreciation Rights with respect to, more than 1,000,000 Shares;  
         
    (b) 
    Awards of Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units relating to more than 240,000 Shares;  
           
    (c) 
    Awards of Performance Shares, and/or Awards of Performance Units the value of which is based on the Fair Market Value of Shares, for more than 240,000 Shares;  
           
    (d) 
    Awards of Performance Units, the value of which is not based on the Fair Market Value of Shares, for more than $3,000,000;  
           
    (e) 
    other Stock-based Awards pursuant to Section 13 relating to more than 240,000 Shares;  

13 

In all cases, determinations under this Section 4 should be made in a manner that is consistent with the exemption for performance based compensation that Code Section 162(m) provides.  
  5.       Deemed Achievement of Performance Goals  .  The Committee s discretion to deem some or all of the Performance Goals under a Grandfathered Award to have been achieved (in whole or part) upon Retirement or other termination of employment shall be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m).     
  6.      Adjustments  .  Upon the occurrence of an event described in Section 18 of the Plan, the Committee shall have the discretion to adjust the individual award limits described in Section 4 above and the Performance Goals under a Grandfathered Award in the manner permitted by Section 18, but only to the extent such discretion does not cause a Grandfathered Award to cease to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m). 
  7.      Shareholder Approval of Amendments to Appendix A  .  To the extent required by Code Section 162(m), shareholders must approve any amendments to this Appendix A (except as permitted by Section 18 of the Plan).
